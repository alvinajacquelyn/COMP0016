            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015, The Author(s).Clustering is the propensity of nodes that share a common neighbour to be connected. It is ubiquitous in many networks but poses many modelling challenges. Clustering typically manifests itself by a higher than expected frequency of triangles, and this has led to the principle of constructing networks from such building blocks. This approach has been generalised to networks being constructed from a set of more exotic subgraphs. As long as these are fully connected, it is then possible to derive mean-field models that approximate epidemic dynamics well. However, there are virtually no results for non-fully connected subgraphs. In this paper, we provide a general and automated approach to deriving a set of ordinary differential equations, or mean-field model, that describes, to a high degree of accuracy, the expected values of system-level quantities, such as the prevalence of infection. Our approach offers a previously unattainable degree of control over the arrangement of subgraphs and network characteristics such as classical node degree, variance and clustering. The combination of these features makes it possible to generate families of networks with different subgraph compositions while keeping classical network metrics constant. Using our approach, we show that higher-order structure realised either through the introduction of loops of different sizes or by generating networks based on different subgraphs but with identical degree distribution and clustering, leads to non-negligible differences in epidemic dynamics.",

We sought to determine the relative frequencies of the different causes of anaemia including absolute and functional iron deficiency, and the association of different haematological parameters, including plasma hepcidin, a key protein responsible for iron regulation, with outcomes after cardiac surgery. Methods: Prospective observational study between January 2012 and 2013; 200 anaemic cardiac surgical patients were recruited and 165 were studied. Detailed blood and bone marrow analysis was performed. Primary outcome was days alive and out of hospital. Results: Mean (SD) haemoglobin (Hb) was 102 (8) g/L for women and 112 (11) g/L for men. Regarding outcomes, 137 (83%) patients were transfused at least one unit of red blood cells; 30-day mortality was 1.8% (three patients). Functional iron deficiency was diagnosed in 78 patients (47%). Plasma hepcidin concentration was the only haematological variable associated with outcome, with mean days alive and out of hospital 2.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 5.1) days less if hepcidin \u226520 ng/mL compared with <20 ng/mL (p=0.024). Multivariable analysis showed that the association between hepcidin and outcome was independent of risk (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation), transfusion and Hb. Conclusions: Functional iron deficiency was the most common cause of anaemia but was not associated with outcome. The only haematological parameter that was associated with outcome was hepcidin concentration, which is a novel finding and introduces further complexity into our understanding of the role of iron and its regulation by hepcidin. We propose that future research should target patients with elevated hepcidin.",

There has been an ever-growing interest in investigating these properties, driven by the desire to further miniaturize electronic devices, develop new functional materials and catalysts. Here, the intriguing question of how diffusion evolves in a single nanoparticle is investigated by measuring the spatial and temporal variations of the diffracted coherent X-ray intensity during copper diffusion into a gold nanocrystal. Dislocation loops formed from the insertion of single layer of extra atoms between neighbouring gold host lattice planes are detected. Au-Cu alloy channels are found to penetrate the nanocrystal due to the differential diffusion rate along different directions. With the advent of higher brilliance sources and free-electron-lasers, Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging can play an important role in unveiling atomic behaviours in three dimensions for nanomaterials during various fundamental processes.",

All rights reserved.Systemic doses of the psychotomimetic ketamine alter the spectral characteristics of hippocampal and prefrontal cortical network activity. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of cross-spectral densities, we quantify the putative synaptic mechanisms underlying ketamine effects in terms of changes in directed, effective connectivity between dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal (dCA1-mPFC) cortex of freely moving rats. We parameterize dose-dependent changes in spectral signatures of dCA1-mPFC local field potential recordings, using neural mass models of glutamatergic and GABAergic circuits. Optimizing DCMs of theta and gamma frequency range responses, model comparisons suggest that both enhanced gamma and depressed theta power result from a reduction in top-down connectivity from mPFC to the hippocampus, mediated by postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). This is accompanied by an alteration in the bottom-up pathway from dCA1 to mPFC, which exhibits a distinct asymmetry: here, feed-forward drive at AMPA receptors increases in the presence of decreased NMDAR-mediated inputs. Setting these findings in the context of predictive coding suggests that NMDAR antagonism by ketamine in recurrent hierarchical networks may result in the failure of top-down connections from higher cortical regions to signal predictions to lower regions in the hierarchy, which consequently fail to respond consistently to errors. Given that NMDAR dysfunction has a central role in pathophysiological theories of schizophrenia and that theta and gamma rhythm abnormalities are evident in schizophrenic patients, the approach followed here may furnish a framework for the study of aberrant hierarchical message passing (of prediction errors) in schizophrenia - and the false perceptual inferences that ensue.",

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.RGBD images with high quality annotations, both in the form of geometric (i.e., segmentation) and structural (i.e., how do the segments mutually relate in 3D) information, provide valuable priors for a diverse range of applications in scene understanding and image manipulation. While it is now simple to acquire RGBD images, annotating them, automatically or manually, remains challenging. We present SmartAnnotator, an interactive system to facilitate annotating raw RGBD images. The system performs the tedious tasks of grouping pixels, creating potential abstracted cuboids, inferring object interactions in 3D, and generates an ordered list of hypotheses. The user simply has to flip through the suggestions for segment labels, finalize a selection, and the system updates the remaining hypotheses. As annotations are finalized, the process becomes simpler with fewer ambiguities to resolve. Moreover, as more scenes are annotated, the system makes better suggestions based on the structural and geometric priors learned from previous annotation sessions. We test the system on a large number of indoor scenes across different users and experimental settings, validate the results on existing benchmark datasets, and report significant improvements over low-level annotation alternatives.

Monophasic glucose response (MGR) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We investigated the association between current MGR and (1) glucose tolerance during a pregnancy 3 years before and (2) current glucose tolerance status. We also sought (3) other determinants of MGR. Research Design and Methods. We conducted a nested case-control study of GDM (n=47 early GDM, diagnosed between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation; n=40 late GDM, diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation) and matched healthy controls (n=37, normal glucose tolerance during pregnancy) all free from diabetes at follow-up 3.4\u00b10.6 years after delivery. Glucose tolerance was determined by 2-hour 75 g OGTT. Monophasic and biphasic groups were defined based on serum glucose measurements during OGTT. Results. The biphasic group was younger, had lower triglyceride levels and area under the OGTT glucose curve, and was less frequently diagnosed with early GDM (25 vs. 45%, all p<0.05). Women with a biphasic response also tended to have lower systolic blood pressure (p<0.1). No differences were found in fasting and 2-hour glucose and insulin levels, or BMI. According to multiple logistic regression, MGR was associated with prior early GDM (OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.92-4.99) and elevated triglyceride levels (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.03-5.03/log (mmol/l)). Conclusions. We found that more severe, early-onset GDM was an independent predictor of monophasic glucose response suggesting that monophasic response may represent an intermediate state between GDM and manifest type 2 diabetes.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder which may result in a broad range of complications including recurring and severe episodes of pain - sickle 'crises' - which require frequent hospitalizations. We assessed the cost of hospitalizations associated with SCD with crisis in England. Methods Hospital Episodes Statistics data for all hospital episodes in England between 2010 and 2011 recording Sickle Cell Anaemia with Crisis as primary diagnosis were used. The total cost of admissions and exceeded length of stay due to SCD were assessed using Healthcare Resource Groups tariffs. The impact of patients' characteristics on SCD admissions costs and the likelihood of incurring extra bed days were also examined. Results In 2010-11, England had 6077 admissions associated with SCD with crisis as primary diagnosis. The total cost for these admissions for commissioners was \u00a318 798 255. The cost of admissions increases with age (children admissions costs 50% less than adults). Patients between 10 and 19 years old are more likely to stay longer in hospital compared with others. Conclusion SCD represents a significant cost for commissioners and the NHS. Further work is required to assess how best to manage patients in the community, which could potentially lead to a reduction in hospital admissions and length of stay, and their associated costs.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: ELR+ CXC chemokines are heparin-binding cytokines signalling through the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors. ELR+ CXC chemokines have been associated with inflammatory arthritis due to their capacity to attract inflammatory cells. Here, we describe an unsuspected physiological function of these molecules in articular cartilage homeostasis. Methods: Chemokine receptors and ligands were detected by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and RT-PCR. Osteoarthritis was induced in wild-type and CXCR2-/- mice by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM). CXCR1/2 signalling was inhibited in vitro using blocking antibodies or siRNA. Chondrocyte phenotype was analysed using Alcian blue staining, RT-PCR and western blotting. AKT phosphorylation and SOX9 expression were upregulated using constitutively active AKT or SOX9 plasmids. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. Results: CXCL6 was expressed in healthy cartilage and was retained through binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. CXCR2-/- mice developed more severe osteoarthritis than wild types following DMM, with increased chondrocyte apoptosis. Disruption of CXCR1/2 in human and CXCR2 signalling in mouse chondrocytes led to a decrease in extracellular matrix production, reduced expression of chondrocyte differentiation markers and increased chondrocyte apoptosis. CXCR2- dependent chondrocyte homeostasis was mediated by AKT signalling since forced expression of constitutively active AKT rescued the expression of phenotypic markers and the apoptosis induced by CXCR2 blockade. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates an important physiological role for CXCR1/2 signalling in maintaining cartilage homeostasis and suggests that the loss of ELR+ CXC chemokines during cartilage breakdown in osteoarthritis contributes to the characteristic loss of chondrocyte phenotypic stability.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. All rights reserved.Background: Pregnancies in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) are known to have high rates of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Given these pregnancy-associated problems for women with SCD, advice both about pregnancy planning and about effective contraception are of paramount importance. This study sought to discover the contraception methods used by women with SCD, what complications women with SCD encounter with contraception, and their experiences of pre-pregnancy counselling and pregnancy planning, and how such issues may have changed over the past two decades. Method: The study was a multicentre, interview-based, cross-sectional study. Interviews were carried out with 102 women with SCD, in north and central London during 2010, concerning their current and previous contraceptive use, their pregnancy history, their menstrual history, and the advice they received concerning pregnancy planning and contraception. Patient information was anonymised and ethical approval was obtained. These data were compared with data from a similar study undertaken in 1993. Results: There were significant differences in a number of key areas: the number of unplanned pregnancies decreased from 64% in 1993 to 53% in 2010. The number of women with SCD who were advised not to become pregnant also fell, from 36% to 15%. The use of combined oral contraceptive pills declined, from 45% of the women in 1993 to 31% in 2010. Conversely the use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate contraception (DMPA) and the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) both increased. Conclusions: Significant changes in the contraceptive methods used by women with SCD are demonstrated in the London population. LNG-IUS use in SCD has not been investigated before. There has been an encouraging decrease in the number of women with SCD who are advised not to become pregnant, perhaps reflecting an improvement in their overall health. Although the number of unplanned pregnancies has fallen, it remains high - emphasising the continuing need for women with SCD to have access to informed advice about pregnancy-associated issues and contraception.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.The flush toilet is an illogical form of sanitation from the point of view of water conservation, nutrient recovery and water pollution. Places such as London, with one of the oldest flushing toilet and sewer systems in the world, bears witness to the limits of its universal applicability through dwindling freshwater resources and polluted waterways. It is therefore important to develop new forms of sanitation infrastructure. An actor\u2013network theory coevolution framework is used to explore and gain insights into the coevolution pathways for new types and paradigms of sanitation in London, where waterborne sanitation is currently prevalent. This approach shows that while flushing toilets are currently stable network configurations, there are coevolution pathways that would shift the system towards dry sanitation. The quantity of freshwater resources available for toilet flushing was the main actant cited for the development of these coevolution pathways.",

All rights reserved.Context Intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) can impair the precise molecular analysis of tumours and may contribute to difficulties encountered in cancer biomarker qualification and treatment personalisation. Objective This review summarises the evidence for genetic ITH in renal, bladder, and prostate carcinomas and potential strategies to address the clinical and translational research challenges arising from ITH. Evidence acquisition Publications that assessed ITH in the relevant urologic cancers were identified in a literature review. Evidence synthesis ITH with functionally distinct tumour subclones has been identified in all three tumour types. Heterogeneity of actionable genetic changes and of prognostic biomarkers between different tumour regions in the same patient suggests limitations of single biopsy-based molecular analyses for precision medicine approaches. Evolutionary constraints may differ between patients and may allow the prediction of specific evolutionary trajectories. Conclusions Assessment of multiple tumour regions for precision medicine purposes, monitoring of subclonal dynamics over time, and the preferential targeting of genetic alterations located on the trunk of the phylogenetic tree of individual cancers may accelerate the development of personalised medicine strategies and improve our understanding of treatment failure. Patient summary Genetic alterations can be heterogeneous within urologic tumours, complicating their use as biomarkers for treatment personalisation. We present novel strategies to address these challenges.",

This chapter has no such grand historical sweep, but focuses just on the last twenty years. Since the advent of the first Blair government in 1997 the United Kingdom has gone through an unprecedented period of constitutional change, which has seen the creation of important new conventions; modification of old conventions; codification of many conventions; and the demise of conventions rendered obsolete. So the United Kingdom\u2019s recent history is a test bed for the birth, death, evolution and codification of constitutional conventions. There have been so many changes to our conventions that coverage of each must necessarily be brief. The constitutional reforms can be divided into four successive waves, linked to the different prime ministers in charge. Blair's first government (1997-2001) introduced the first big tidal wave of reforms, with the creation in 1998 of devolved governments and legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; a directly enforceable bill of rights in the Human Rights Act 1998; and removal of the hereditary peers in 1999, leaving the House of Lords an almost entirely appointed House. His second government (2001-2005) introduced a second wave of judicial reforms in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, with the Lord Chief Justice replacing the Lord Chancellor as head of the judiciary, introduction of a Judicial Appointments Commission, and creation of the new Supreme Court, separate from the House of Lords.",

A behavioural programme may fail to change or have no significant impact on the frequency or severity of a target behaviour whilst it is in operation. The response cost approach can be said to constitute an ameliorative strategy to compensate for impairment of frontal lobe functioning. Considering the cognitive deficits and learning problems produced by brain injury, such criticisms have serious implications for the value of using behavioural techniques with sub group of patients. The application of behavioural techniques to brain injury rehabilitation have led to the emergence of methods for controlling or reducing post-traumatic behavioural sequelae, allowing therapies aimed at increasing functional independence to take place.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 International Psychogeriatric Association 2016.Background: Equipping staff with the skills to provide high quality care in dementia is essential. The Biopsychosocial (BPS) model of dementia (Spector and Orrell, 2010) is a practical tool designed to encourage staff to develop personalized interventions and treatment plans for people with dementia. This feasibility study aimed to examine the impact of training staff to use the BPS model on skills of formulation, attitude towards dementia and sense of role competence. Method: A within-subjects design was used. Thirty-seven staff working in dementia care across a community mental health team (CMHT), inpatient wards, and residential care homes were trained to use the BPS model. Outcomes were measured at baseline, post-training, and four week follow-up. Results: The ability of staff to understand, formulate, and develop interventions for people with dementia increased significantly following training. There were small, non-significant improvements in positive attitudes, and sense of competence following training. Staff also reported that training improved their understanding of biological and psychosocial factors in dementia. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that training staff to use the BPS model can lead to improvements in their ability to understand and develop interventions for people with dementia. Further research would be required to draw firm conclusions about its effectiveness.",

Measurement of brachial blood pressure alone may exaggerate the true blood pressure elevation due to exercise-induced change to pressure amplification. Whether blood pressure-lowering treatment modulates pressure amplification during exercise is unknown. Methods: Thirty-two participants with stage 1-2 hypertension (mean age 59.2 years) received eight weeks' blood pressure lowering with either aliskiren (300mg, n=16) or valsartan (320mg, n=16). Brachial and central aortic pressure (CASP) were measured non-invasively during treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol) at baseline, after eight weeks' treatment and 48 hours following treatment withdrawal. Results: The rise in brachial blood pressure with exercise exceeded the rise in CASP, indicative of enhanced pressure amplification. Eight weeks' treatment elicited similar reductions in brachial blood pressure and CASP which did not differ between rest and peak exercise (p>0.05). The exercise-induced increase in systolic pressure amplification did not differ between baseline and following eight weeks' treatment (p>0.05). These effects remained unchanged following treatment withdrawal. Conclusion: Blood pressure lowering does not directly influence the relationship between aortic and brachial pressure either at rest or during exercise in patients with hypertension, other than through proportionate lowering of both pressures. These effects remained unchanged 48 hours after a simulated missed medication dose.",

This problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with an L1-regularization term.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) exist in pancreatic beta cells, and HS seems to modulate important interactions in the islet microenvironment. However, the intra-islet structures of HS in health or altered glucose homeostasis are currently unknown.Here we show that distinct spatial distribution of HS motifs is present in islets in the adult, that intra-islet HS motifs are mostly conserved between rodents and humans, and that HS is abundant in glucagon producing islet alpha cells. In beta cells HS is characterised by 2-O, 6-O and N-sulphated moieties, whereas HS in alpha cells is N-acetylated, N-, and 2-O sulphated and low in 6-O groups. Differential expression of three HS modifying genes in alpha and beta cells was observed and may account for the different HS patterns. Furthermore, we found that FGF1 and FGF2 were present in alpha cells, whereas functional FGFRs exist in beta cells, but not in the alpha cell line aTC1-6, or in primary alpha cells in islets. FGF1 induced signalling was dependent on 2-O, and 6-O HS sulphation in beta cells, and HS desulphation reduced beta cell proliferation and potentiated oxidant induced apoptosis. In leptin resistant animals and in islets from streptozotocin treated rats there was a reduction in alpha cell HS expression.These data demonstrate the distinct HS expression patterns in alpha and beta islet cells and propose a novel role for alpha cells as a source of paracrine FGF ligands to neighbouring beta cells with specific cell-associated HS domains mediating the activation and diffusion of paracrine ligands.",

            "DOI": "10.1002/sim.6486",
            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a quasi-experimental design that estimates the causal effects of a treatment by exploiting naturally occurring treatment rules. It can be applied in any context where a particular treatment or intervention is administered according to a pre-specified rule linked to a continuous variable. Such thresholds are common in primary care drug prescription where the RD design can be used to estimate the causal effect of medication in the general population. Such results can then be contrasted to those obtained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and inform prescription policy and guidelines based on a more realistic and less expensive context. In this paper, we focus on statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, however, the methodology can be applied to many other drugs provided these are prescribed in accordance to pre-determined guidelines. Current guidelines in the UK state that statins should be prescribed to patients with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk scores in excess of 20%. If we consider patients whose risk scores are close to the 20%risk score threshold, we find that there is an element of random variation in both the risk score itself and its measurement. We can therefore consider the threshold as a randomising device that assigns statin prescription to individuals just above the threshold and withholds it from those just below. Thus, we are effectively replicating the conditions of an RCT in the area around the threshold, removing or at least mitigating confounding. We frame the RD design in the language of conditional independence, which clarifies the assumptions necessary to apply an RD design to data, and which makes the links with instrumental variables clear. We also have context-specific knowledge about the expected sizes of the effects of statin prescription and are thus able to incorporate this into Bayesian models by formulating informative priors on our causal parameters.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.In Africa, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is delivered with limited laboratory monitoring, often none. In 2003-2004, investigators in the Development of Antiretroviral Therapy in Africa (DART) Trial randomized persons initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe to either laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) or clinically driven monitoring (CDM). CD4 cell counts were measured every 12 weeks in both groups but were only returned to treating clinicians for management in the LCM group. Follow-up continued through 2008. In observational analyses, dynamic marginal structural models on pooled randomized groups were used to estimate survival under different monitoring-frequency and clinical/immunological switching strategies. Assumptions included no direct effect of randomized group on mortality or confounders and no unmeasured confounders which influenced treatment switch and mortality or treatment switch and time-dependent covariates. After 48 weeks of first-line ART, 2,946 individuals contributed 11,351 person-years of follow-up, 625 switches, and 179 deaths. The estimated survival probability after a further 240 weeks for post-48-week switch at the first CD4 cell count less than 100 cells/mm3 or non-Candida World Health Organization stage 4 event (with CD4 count <250) was 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 0.97) with 12-weekly CD4 testing, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.97) with 24-weekly CD4 testing, 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96) with a single CD4 test at 48 weeks (baseline), and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.94) with no CD4 testing. Comparing randomized groups by 48-week CD4 count, the mortality risk associated with CDM versus LCM was greater in persons with CD4 counts of <100 (hazard ratio = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.3) than in those with CD4 counts of \u2265100 (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.7; interaction P = 0.04). These findings support a benefit from identifying patients immunologically failing first-line ART at 48 weeks.",

We establish that the problem of recovering the probability density function (pdf) of random parameters falls into the class of convexly-constrained inverse problems. The framework offers an estimation method that separates computational solution of the structural model from estimation. We first discuss nonparametric identification. Then, we propose two alternative estimation procedures to estimate the density and derive their asymptotic properties. Our general framework allows us to deal with unobservable nuisance variables, e.g., measurement error, but also covers the case when there are no such nuisance variables. Finally, Monte Carlo experiments for several structural models are provided which illustrate the performance of our estimation procedure.",

In this study six Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients treated for motor symptoms with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the left subthalamic nucleus (STN) were tested preoperatively and at approximately 6 and 18 months postoperatively with a dichotic listening task. Results show a significant decline of the right ear advantage over time. In three of the patients a right ear advantage preoperativley changed to a left ear advantage 18 months postoperatively. This suggests the possibility that additional longitudinal studies of this phenomenon could serve as a model for understanding changes in indirect measures of speech lateralization in stroke patients.",

British HIV Association guidelines suggest tropism testing may remain valid for only 90 days in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients. We aimed to determine the accuracy of this figure. Tropism was assessed in 26 antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients with ongoing viral replication, sampled yearly from first clinic visit. The V3 region of HIV-1 was sequenced in triplicate, then tropism predicted using the Geno2Pheno system. Baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 52 months (range 7\u201381). For 19/26 individuals baseline tropism remained unchanged throughout a median of 54 months follow-up; 18 R5 tropic and 1 X4 tropic. In seven patients (27%) baseline tropism switched at least once (range 1\u20134 switches) during follow-up; however, their baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 45 months. Co-receptor tropism in treatment-na\u00efve patients with ongoing viral replication appears highly stable over time, suggesting that baseline genotypic tropism prediction may be valid for a longer duration in patients delaying ART initiation. In this study, baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 52 months, suggesting current guidelines recommending repeat testing after 90 days may be excessively conservative in their assessment of tropism stability.",

The aim of this paper was to explore a case study of a peer assessor composing and receiving peer feedback. The paper reports a case study tracking a peer assessor through the process of grading and composing peer comments and her reactions to receiving peer feedback. The data consist of feedback comments, reflections and a series of interviews. It was found that while the process of composing feedback comments was viewed positively, receiving comments was, on the whole, viewed negatively. The author suggests helping students to become peer assessors is a long-term process; initial peer feedback should be withheld. As students develop expertise in the subject matter and in composing feedback, comments could be exchanged.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.The nature of the apparently continuous structural phase transition at 1,049 K in the perovskite-structured, MgSiOinf3/inf isomorph, neighborite (NaMgFinf3/inf), from the orthorhombic (Pbnm) hettotype phase to the cubic (Pm3\u00afm) aristotype structure, has been re-investigated using high-resolution, time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction. Using data collected at 1 K intervals close to the nominal phase transition temperature, the temperature dependence of the intensities of superlattice reflections at the M point (2\u03c0/a[1/2,1/2,0]) and the R point (2\u03c0/a[1/2,1/2,1/2]) of the pseudo-cubic Brillouin zone indicate the existence of a new intermediate tetragonal phase in space group P4/mbm, with a narrow phase field extending from ~1,046.5 to ~1,048.5 K, at ambient pressure. Group theoretical analysis shows that the structural transitions identified in this study, Pbnm\u2013P4/mbm, and P4/mbm\u2013Pm3\u00afm, are permitted to be second order. The observation of the tetragonal phase resolves the longstanding issue of why the high-temperature phase transition, previously identified as Pbnm\u2013Pm3\u00afm, and which would be expected to be first order under Landau theory, is in fact found to be continuous. Analysis of the pseudocubic shear strain shows it to vary with a critical exponent of 0.5 implying that the phase transition from Pbnm to P4/mbm is tricritical in character. The large librational modes that exist in the MgFinf6/inf octahedron at high temperature, and the use of Gaussian probability density functions to describe atomic displacements, result in apparent bond shortening in the Mg\u2013F distances, making mode amplitude determination an unreliable method for determination of the critical exponent from internal coordinates. Crystal structures are reported for the three phases of NaMgFinf3/inf at 1,033 K (Pbnm), 1,047 K (P4/mbm) and 1,049 K (Pm3\u00afm).",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 NIHR Journals Library. All rights reserved.Background: Partner notification is the process of providing support for, informing and treating sexual partners of individuals who have been diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is traditionally undertaken by specialist sexual health services, and may involve informing a partner on a patient\u2019s behalf, with consent. With an increasing proportion of STIs diagnosed in general practice and other community settings, there is a growing need to understand the best way to provide partner notification for people diagnosed with a STI in this setting using a web-based referral system.Objective: We aimed to compare three different approaches to partner notification for people diagnosed with chlamydia within general practice.Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: General practices in England and, within these, patients tested for and diagnosed with genital chlamydia or other bacterial STIs in that setting using a web-based referral system. Interventions: Three different approaches to partner notification: patient referral alone, or the additional offer of either provider referral or contract referral.m Main outcome measures: (1) Number of main partners per index patient treated for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea/non-specific urethritis/pelvic inflammatory disease; and (2) proportion of index patients testing negative for the relevant STI at 3 months.Results: As testing rates for chlamydia were far lower than expected, we were unable to scale up the trial, which was concluded at pilot stage. We are not able to answer the original research question. We present the results of the work undertaken to improve recruitment to similar studies requiring opportunistic recruitment of young people in general practice. We were unable to standardise provider and contract referral separately; however, we also present results of qualitative work aimed at optimizing these interventions.Conclusions: External recruitment may be required to facilitate the recruitment of young people to research in general practice, especially in sensitive areas, because of specific barriers experienced by general practice staff. Costs need to be taken into account together with feasibility considerations. Partner notification interventions for bacterial STIs may not be clearly separable into the three categories of patient, provider and contract referral. Future research is needed to operationalise the approaches of provider and contract partner notification if future trials are to provide generalisable information.",

Economy-wide indicators provide information on the structure of the metabolism and allow the measurement of domestic and foreign resource use, resource productivity and physical growth. Business-level material flow analysis focuses on material flows and associated environmental pressures within a company, firm or plant. It may support material flow and stock management, enhance environmental management and provide the basis for environmental reporting. Analysing total material requirements, as well as the various specific impacts of resource use, requires significant efforts to deepen and broaden scientific findings and to build up regular monitoring.",

            "Abstract": "Leukemic lymphoblasts within different immunophenotypic populations possess stem cell properties. However, whether or not the self-renewal program is retained from stem cells or conferred on progenitors by leukemogenic molecules remains unknown. We have addressed the issue in the context of TEL-AML1-associated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by profiling a refined program edited from genes essential for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and B-cell development. Bioinformatic analysis shows that ALL populations are loosely clustered and close to the normal population that contains stem and primitive progenitor cells. This finding indicates that immunophenotypes do not reflect maturation stages in ALL and that the self-renewal program may be retained from stem cells. Results of assessing 'first hit' function of TEL-AML1 in different populations of normal cells demonstrate the molecular model. Therefore, the current study shows a leukemogenic scenario of human ALL in which programs of stem cells are sustained in distinct fractions by leukemogenic mutations.",

The authors explore and describe the state of the art of research, knowledge, and prospects for the future for this important family of proteins. The first ABC transporter was discovered in 1973 and was named P-glycoprotein. It elicits resistance to cytotoxic drugs, chiefly in human tumours, within which chemotherapy failure is observed in about 50% of cases. Together with its complex pharmacology, and even a suspected role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this ABC transporter still eludes a clinical solution to its multidrug resistance property. ABC transporters are integral membrane active proteins and they belong to one of the largest protein families across all species. Their myriad roles encompass the import or export of a diverse range of allocrites, including ion, nutrients, peptides, polysaccharides, lipids, and xenobiotics. They are of major medical importance with many members elaborating multidrug resistance in bacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites, and humans. Other ABC transporters are involved in a number of inherited diseases, including cystic fibrosis, macular degeneration, gout, and several other metabolic disorders.",

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is currently discussing the development of a Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) that would mirror the categories and criteria used to assess the conservation status of species. The suggested scientific foundations for the RLE are being considered by IUCN for adoption as the backbone of the RLE. We identify conceptual and operational weaknesses in the draft RLE approach, the categories, and criteria. While species are relatively well-described units, there is no consistent means to classify ecosystems for assessing conservation status. The proposed RLE is framed mostly around certain features of ecosystems such as broad vegetation or habitat types, and do not consider major global change drivers such as climate change. We discuss technical difficulties with the proposed concept of ecosystem collapse and suggest it is not analogous to species extinction. We highlight the lack of scientific basis for the criteria and thresholds proposed by the RLE, and question the need to adopt the structure of the Red List of Species for an RLE. We suggest that the proposed RLE is open to ambiguous interpretations and uncertain outcomes, and that its practicality and benefit for conservation should be carefully evaluated before final approval.",

All rights reserved.As consequence of the steady increase in processing foods consumption, especially because of the current lifestyles of the population, the industry is always creating novel process technology to improve quality, productivity, and attendance of the new markets. Nevertheless, these new technologies, covering thermal and non-thermal processing, affect the value nutritional of food. The vitamins play an important role in the health and can be affected by industrial processing. Modern food processing methods based on short-term treatment such as pulsed electric fields; osmotic dehydration, radiation and high-pressure processing cause negligible degradation of carotenoid. For example, it has been reported that ohmic heating causes no change in carotenoid content; while microwave heating and freeze-drying caused the lowest degradation of carotenoid. Ultrasound treatment of food changed carotenoids into colorless and unknown compounds. These results indicate that although heating processes in short time had a lower degrading effect on carotenoid content, they should be used cautiously to cause the lowest impact on carotenoid content. Regarding the light effect on carotenoid degradation, it has been reported that degradation rate is higher in samples stored at light compared to those kept in darkness. In general, carotenoid degradation can be lowered by reduction temperature, processing time, light and oxygen and application of antioxidants. In this chapter, the effects of processing on bioavailability and bioaccessibility of fat-soluble vitamins were discussed.",

Methods: 30 participants with normal stereopsis and 15 participants with absent stereopsis performed a simulated surgical task both in free space under direct vision (3D) and via a monitor (2D), with both eyes open and one eye covered in each condition. Results: The stereo-normal group scored higher, on average, than the stereo-absent group with both eyes open under direct vision (p<0.001). Both groups performed comparably in monocular and binocular monitor viewing conditions (p=0.579). Conclusions: High-grade stereopsis confers an advantage when performing a fine motor task under direct vision. However, stereopsis does not appear advantageous to task performance under 2D viewing conditions, such as in video-assisted surgery.",

The following measures were taken before and after training: (i) inter-coder agreement, (ii) trainee agreement with expert consensus, (iii) confidence ratings and (iv) coding competence. Coding was assessed for 12 BCTs (workshops) and for 17 BCTs (tutorials). Trainees completed a course evaluation.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Immunology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex and highly heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disorder, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Genetic and functional studies have highlighted a key role for innate immunity in its pathogenesis. Profound systemic defects in innate immunity and acute inflammation are understood to result in markedly delayed clearance of bacteria from the tissues, leading to local chronic granulomatous inflammation and compensatory adaptive immunological changes. Macrophages, key orchestrators of acute inflammation, are likely to play an important role in the initial impaired innate immune response. Monocyte-derived macrophages from CD patients stimulated with Escherichia coli were shown to release attenuated levels of tumour necrosis factor and interferon-\u03b3 with normal secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10 and IL-6. In controls, the secretion of these cytokines was strongly positively correlated, which was not seen with CD macrophages. The transcriptomes of CD and control macrophages were examined in an attempt to understand the molecular basis of this defect. There were no differentially expressed genes identified between the two groups, consistent with genetic heterogeneity; however, a number of molecules were found to be under-expressed in subgroups of CD patients. The most common of these was optineurin (OPTN) which was under-expressed in approximately 10% of the CD patients. Reduced OPTN expression coincided with lower intracellular protein levels and diminished cytokine secretion after bacterial stimulation both in the patients and with small interfering RNA knockdown in THP-1 cells. Identifying and studying subgroups of patients with shared defective gene expression could aid our understanding of the mechanisms underlying highly heterogeneous diseases such as CD.",

The hippocampus, a structure essential for memory, is particularly vulnerable to such insults. Hence, some neonates undergoing treatment for acute respiratory failure might sustain bilateral hippocampal pathology early in life and memory problems later in childhood. We investigated this possibility in a cohort of 40 children who had been treated neonatally for acute respiratory failure but were free of overt neurological impairment. The cohort had mean hippocampal volumes (HVs) significantly below normal control values, memory scores significantly below the standard population means, and memory quotients significantly below those predicted by their full scale IQs. Brain white matter volume also fell below the volume of the controls, but brain gray matter volumes and scores on nonmnemonic neuropsychological tests were within the normal range. Stepwise linear regression models revealed that the cohort's HVs were predictive of degree of memory impairment, and gestational age at treatment was predictive of HVs: the younger the age, the greater the atrophy. We conclude that many neonates treated for acute respiratory failure sustain significant hippocampal atrophy as a result of the associated hypoxia and, consequently, show deficient memory later in life.",

Patients can also develop other organ involvement, referred to as non-criteria manifestations, including livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia and nephropathy. Non-thrombotic inflammatory mechanisms are increasingly identified in the pathogenesis of APS, alongside a recognition that obstetric APS may be a specific subset of APS. Treatment remains focused on lifelong anticoagulation and prevention of further thrombosis or obstetric complications.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is the commonest cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Laser photocoagulation can be effective in the treatment of DMO; however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. A better understanding of these mechanisms may allow the development of therapeutic approaches that could avoid the deleterious adverse events associated with photocoagulation. Methods: We have used proteomic techniques to identify the protein changes induced by threshold intensity retinal laser treatment in a rodent model of diabetic retinopathy. Retinae were obtained from diabetic Dark Agouti rats 8 weeks following laser treatment. Extracted proteins from lasered and non-lasered diabetic retinae were separated and compared using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Results: Image analysis revealed 24 protein spots with decreased expression after laser treatment and 9 spots with increased expression. On lasered retinal gels, four spots were uniquely expressed, with eight unique spots on non-lasered gels. Twenty-two protein spots of interest were identified using matrix-assisted desorption ionization-mass spectrometry with database matching. Following laser, Wnt-5 beta, LEK-1, GADPH, claudin-12 and calretinin were significantly down-regulated in expression. Conclusions: The present study provides a proteomic insight into the underlying biological basis for the therapeutic effects of laser for DMO. We provide further evidence of the involvement of Wnt pathway signalling in the neural retina in DMO, and for up to 2 months following laser treatment. Changes in LEK-1 and claudin-12 may have effector roles, and changes in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and calretinin may reflect the altered retinal microenvironment resulting from laser treatment.",

The current study investigated how neuronal pathways implicated in response inhibition were affected in IA using a Go-Stop paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-three control subjects aged 15.2 \u00b1 0.5 years (mean \u00b1 S.D.) and eighteen IA subjects aged 15.1 \u00b1 1.4 years were studied. Effective connectivity within the response inhibition network was quantified using (stochastic) dynamic causal modeling (DCM). The results showed that the indirect frontal-basal ganglia pathway was engaged by response inhibition in healthy subjects. However, we did not detect any equivalent effective connectivity in the IA group. This suggests the IA subjects fail to recruit this pathway and inhibit unwanted actions. This study provides a clear link between Internet addiction as a behavioral disorder and aberrant connectivity in the response inhibition network.",

We find two sources of asymptotic bias of the LS estimator: bias due to correlation or heteroscedasticity of the idiosyncratic error term, and bias due to predetermined (as opposed to strictly exogenous) regressors. We provide a bias-corrected LS estimator. We also present bias-corrected versions of the three classical test statistics (Wald, LR, and LM test) and show their asymptotic distribution is a \u03c72-distribution.

A model-independent analysis of the angular moments demonstrates the presence of resonances with spins 1, 2 and 3 at high D+\u03c0- mass. The data are fitted with an amplitude model composed of a quasi-model-independent function to describe the D+\u03c0- S wave together with virtual contributions from the D\u2217(2007)0 and B\u22170 states, and components corresponding to the D2\u2217(2460)0, D1\u2217(2680)0, D3\u2217(2760)0 and D2\u2217(3000)0 resonances.

In Europe, the dominant arrangement for educational accountability is school inspections. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyse the ways in which school inspections in The Netherlands impact on the work of schools. The results of 2 years of survey data of principals and teachers in primary and secondary schools show that inspection primarily drives change indirectly, through encouraging certain developmental processes, rather than through more direct and coercive methods, such as schools reacting to inspection feedback. Specifically, results indicate that school inspections which set clear expectations on what constitutes \u201cgood education\u201d for schools and their stakeholders are strong determinants of improvement actions; principals and schools feel pressure to respond to these prompts and improve their education.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 SAGE Publications.Model-based treatment planning and exposimetry for high-intensity focused ultrasound requires the numerical simulation of nonlinear ultrasound propagation through heterogeneous and absorbing media. This is a computationally demanding problem due to the large distances travelled by the ultrasound waves relative to the wavelength of the highest frequency harmonic. Here, the k-space pseudospectral method is used to solve a set of coupled partial differential equations equivalent to a generalised Westervelt equation. The model is implemented in C++ and parallelised using the message passing interface (MPI) for solving large-scale problems on distributed clusters. The domain is partitioned using a 1D slab decomposition, and global communication is performed using a sparse communication pattern. Operations in the spatial frequency domain are performed in transposed space to reduce the communication burden imposed by the 3D fast Fourier transform. The performance of the model is evaluated using grid sizes up to 4096\u00d72048\u00d72048 grid points, distributed over a cluster using up to 1024 compute cores. Given the global nature of the gradient calculation, the model shows good strong scaling behaviour, with a speed-up of 1.7x whenever the number of cores is doubled. This means large-scale simulations can be distributed across high numbers of cores on a cluster to minimise execution times with a relatively small overhead. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by simulating the ultrasound beam pattern for a high-intensity focused ultrasound sonication of the kidney.",

This study used available data to create a database to evaluate the new buildings built under the Building Schools for Future programme by the British government, using them as a case study to determine whether there was any significant improvement in attainment and absenteeism. It was found that many schools improved in the two years prior to and immediately after the move to the new building, but any improvements in attainment continued only to the third year of occupation, following which it deteriorated considerably. The internal environment and the BREEAM ratings were also analysed, finding no significant overall relationship to the attainment.

However, growing concerns over gemcitabine resistance mean that new combinatory therapies are required to prevent loss of efficacy with prolonged treatment. Here, we suggest that this could be achieved through co-administration of RNA interference agents targeting the ubiquitin ligase ITCH. Stable anti-ITCH siRNA and shRNA dendriplexes with a desirable safety profile were prepared using generation 3 poly(propylenimine) dendrimers (DAB-Am16). The complexes were efficiently taken up by human pancreatic cancer cells and produced a 40-60% decrease in ITCH RNA and protein expression in vitro (si/shRNA) and in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer (shRNA). When co-administered with gemcitabine (100. mg/kg/week) at a subtherapeutic dose, treatment with ITCH-shRNA (3x 50. mg/week) was able to fully suppress tumour growth for 17. days, suggesting that downregulation of ITCH mediated by DAB-Am16/shRNA sensitizes pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine in an efficient and specific manner.",

All rights reserved.The population of children born with the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) continues to expand, and the oldest ART offspring are now entering adult life. Perinatal and birth outcomes have been studied thoroughly but there is a great emphasis on the need for future study of long-term outcomes. The health and prognosis of these offspring is increasingly relevant to: (i) ART-conceived children and their parents; (ii) couples considering fertility treatment; and (iii) the general population. This chapter summarizes current evidence regarding the health of children conceived following ART, encompassing perinatal and neonatal outcomes, congenital malformations, neuro-developmental outcome, physical health, psychosocial well-being, and the risk of cancer. Current evidence suggests that ART increases the risk of higher order pregnancies, prematurity and low birth weight, together with their associated health risks. Reassuringly, the evidence points away from increased cancer risks or neuro-cognitive problems. A number of unknowns remain, including future fertility, risk of cerebral palsy, and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, it is essential that follow-up of ART children continues as they progress through adolescence into adulthood.",

The coefficient of variation [V] for pig measurements at the sites of Wayaogou, Quanhucun and Jiangzhai was calculated, and we observed patterns that show evidence of two populations of different-size pigs, supporting the likelihood that both wild and domestic pigs were present. Also, size reduction of pigs can be traced within the Neolithic-early Bronze Age archaeo-faunal sequence of the Wei River valley. This size reduction was accompanied by an increase of coefficients of variation through the Neolithic. Both of these trends were probably the consequences of pig domestication, and the morphometric differences probably provide evidence for the different stages of pig domestication in this region.",

Model selection algorithms and statistical analyses, respectively, were used to examine the patterns and significance of the changes.Results: gFD and sFD showed inverse U-shape patterns with aging, with a slighter slope of increase from young to mid-age and a steeper decrease to the old. bFD was less affected by age. Sex differences were evident, specifically in gFD and sFD, with men showing higher FDs. Age \u00d7 sex interaction was significant mainly in the hemispheric analysis, with men undergoing sharper age-related changes. After adjusting for the volume effect, age-related results remained approximately the same, but sex differences changed in most of the features, with women indicating higher values, specifically in the left hemisphere and boundaries. Right hemisphere was still more complex in men.Conclusions: This study is the first that investigates the WM FD spanning adulthood, treating age both as a continuous and categorical variable. We found positive correlations between FD and volume, and our results show similarities with those investigating small-world properties of the brain networks, as well as those of functional complexity and WM integrity. These suggest that FD could yield a highly compact description of the structural changes and also might inform us about functional and cognitive variations.",

Funded by SCOAP3.A search for the rare decay \u03a3+\u2192p\u03bc+\u03bc- is performed using pp collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energies s=7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb-1. An excess of events is observed with respect to the background expectation, with a signal significance of 4.1 standard deviations. No significant structure is observed in the dimuon invariant mass distribution, in contrast with a previous result from the HyperCP experiment. The measured \u03a3+\u2192p\u03bc+\u03bc- branching fraction is (2.2-1.3+1.8)\u00d710-8, where statistical and systematic uncertainties are included, which is consistent with the standard model prediction.",

Generally, prognosis refers to the probability of attaining seizure freedom on treatment and little is known about the natural history of the untreated condition. Here, we summarize aspects of the prognosis and prognostic predictors of treated and untreated epilepsy and of its different syndromes. Usually, epilepsy is a fairly benign condition. Most epilepsies have a good prognosis for full seizure control and eventual discontinuation of AEDs, but epilepsy syndromes have differing outcomes and responses to treatment. Prognostic factors include aetiology, EEG abnormalities, type of seizures and thenumberof seizures experienced before treatment onset, and poor early effects of drugs. Early response to treatment is an important positive predictor of long-term prognosis, while the history of a high number of seizures at the time of diagnosis, intellectual disability, and symptomatic aetiology are negative predictors. Different prognostic patterns can be identified, suggesting that the epileptogenic process is not static. Epilepsy carries a greater than expected risk of premature death. Aetiology is the single most important risk factor for premature death.",

            "Abstract": "Objective To investigate the role of longitudinal plasma neurofilament heavy chain protein (NfH) levels as an indicator of clinical progression and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods A cross-sectional study involving 136 clinically heterogeneous patients with ALS and 104 healthy and neurological controls was extended to include a prospective analysis of 74 of these ALS cases, with samplings at approximately 3-month intervals in a follow-up period of up to 3 years. We analysed the correlation between longitudinal NfH-phosphoform levels and disease progression. Temporal patterns of NfH changes were evaluated using multilevel linear regression. Results Baseline plasma NfH levels were higher than controls only in patients with ALS with short disease duration to baseline sampling. Compared with controls, fast-progressing patients with ALS, particularly those with a short diagnostic latency and disease duration, had higher plasma NfH levels at an early stage and lower levels closer to end-stage disease. Lower NfH levels between visits were associated with rapid functional deterioration. We also detected antibodies against NfH, NfH aggregates and NfH cleavage products. Conclusions Disease progression in ALS involves defined trajectories of plasma NfH levels, reflecting speed of neurological decline and survival. Intervisit plasma NfH changes are also indicative of disease progression. This study confirms that longitudinal measurements of NfH plasma levels are more informative than cross-sectional studies, where the time of sampling may represent a bias in the interpretation of the results. Autoantibodies against NfH aggregates and NfH cleavage products may explain the variable expression of plasma NfH with disease progression.",

However, the evidence base does not appear to support this and is of poor quality, focussing on population level outcomes, usually related only to participation in organised sports. A new approach to research into the effects of such events is required focussing on the processes and mechanisms by which population physical activity levels might be increased enabling more effective use of such events in the future. Two separate processes, the 'demonstration effect' and 'festival effect,' have been proposed in Government guidance and are explored using qualitative methods in eight inactive people and four physical activity promotion specialists in Brighton & Hove. The findings appear to support the idea that watching elite athletes compete is unlikely to inspire participation among inactive people and may even discourage it by reducing self-efficacy as a result of the perceived competence gap. Despite this, positive attitudes towards the London Olympics were observed among inactive members of the public and a desire to become actively involved in the event. Examples of intention to continue participating in community events and physical activities as a result of positive experiences of Olympic related events were also observed.",

A Twitter social media campaign promoting the hashtag #colorectalsurgery was launched with the aim of providing a specialty-specific forum to collate discussions and science relevant to an engaged, global community of coloproctologists. This article reviews initial experiences of the early adoption, engagement and utilization of this pilot initiative. Methods: The hashtag #colorectalsurgery was promoted via the online microblogging service Twitter across a 180-day interval. Data on all tweets containing the #colorectalsurgery hashtag were analysed using online analytical tools. Data included total number of tweets, number of views, and user engagement since registration and launch of the campaign. Content of tweet and user demographic analysis was undertaken. Results: The number of tweets using #colorectalsurgery grew rapidly following the launch on 24 April 2016; #colorectalsurgery was used in 15 708 tweets, which resulted in 65 398 696 impressions and involved 1863 individual Twitter accounts. Increased volumes of #colorectalsurgery tweets were noted in association with the timing of three major international colorectal surgical conferences, and geographical trends were noted. Some 88\u00b74 per cent of all posts were by male users. The top 25 users by volume of #colorectalsurgery tweets had considerable influence and posted 8023 tweets (51\u00b71 per cent). Conclusion: Online global communities formed via healthcare-related hashtags, such as #colorectalsurgery, unify social media posts, scientists, surgeons and authors who have an interest in coloproctology. Furthermore, they facilitate greater connectivity among geographically separate users.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.The ALESS survey has followed up on a sample of 122 sub-millimeter sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South at 870 \u03bcm with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), allowing us to pinpoint the positions of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) to \u223c0.3 arcsec and to find their precise counterparts at different wavelengths. This enabled the first compilation of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a statistically reliable survey of SMGs. In this paper, we present a new calibration of the magphys SED modeling code that is optimized to fit these ultraviolet-to-radio SEDs of star-forming galaxies using an energy balance technique to connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation, and dust emission in a physically consistent way. We derive statistically and physically robust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters (such as stellar masses, dust attenuation, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust masses) for the ALESS SMGs. We find that the ALESS SMGs have median stellar mass , median SFR , median overall V-band dust attenuation mag, median dust mass , and median average dust temperature K. We find that the average intrinsic SED of the ALESS SMGs resembles that of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the infrared range, but the stellar emission of our average SMG is brighter and bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are more extended. We explore how the average SEDs vary with different parameters (redshift, sub-millimeter flux, dust attenuation, and total infrared luminosity), and we provide a new set of SMG templates that can be used to interpret other SMG observations. To put the ALESS SMGs into context, we compare their stellar masses and SFRs with those of less actively star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find that at , about half of the SMGs lie above the star-forming main sequence (with SFRs three times larger than normal galaxies of the same stellar mass), while half are consistent with being at the high-mass end of the main sequence. At higher redshifts (), the SMGs tend to have higher SFRs and stellar masses, but the fraction of SMGs that lie significantly above the main sequence decreases to less than a third.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2014.Background. Schizotypy is a complex concept, commonly defined as a genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia that falls on a continuum between healthy variation and severe mental illness. There is a growing body of evidence supporting an association between childhood trauma and increased psychotic experiences and disorders. However, the evidence as to whether there is a similar association with schizotypy has yet to be systematically synthesized and assessed. Method. We conducted a systematic search of published articles on the association between childhood trauma and schizotypy in four major databases. The search covered articles from 1806 to 1 March 2013 and resulted in 17 003 articles in total. Twenty-five original research studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Results. All 25 studies supported the association between at least one type of trauma and schizotypy, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging between 2.01 and 4.15. There was evidence supporting the association for all types of trauma, with no differential effects. However, there was some variability in the quality of the studies, with most using cross-sectional designs. Individuals who reported adverse experiences in childhood scored significantly higher on positive and negative/disorganized schizotypy compared to those who did not report such experiences. Conclusions. All forms of childhood trauma and other stressful events (e.g. bullying) were found to be associated with schizotypy, with especially strong associations with positive schizotypy. However, because of the methodological limitations of several studies and a lack of further exploration of different possible mechanistic pathways underlying this association, more research is required.",

Twenty-five participants were recruited from Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester, and Newcastle and paired with the same conversational partner. Participants completed a \"spot-the-difference\" task which elicited a considerable amount of contrasting regionally specific sign data in the participant-confederate dyads. Accommodation was observed during the task with younger signers accommodating more than older signers.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ can stimulate ATP production or trigger the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and activating the cell death cascade. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake play a crucial role in neurons by buffering excessive Ca2+ from the cytosol at the time of the transmission of the signal. Changes in the maintenance of mitochondrial Ca2+ may trigger neuronal cell death. Abnormality in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling has been detected in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, and emerging evidence from disease models suggests that mitochondrial Ca2+ may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

All rights reserved.Systemic sclerosis is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by a chronic and frequently progressive course and by extensive patient-to-patient variability. Like other autoimmune diseases, systemic sclerosis occurs more frequently in women, with a peak of onset in the fifth decade of life. The exact cause of systemic sclerosis remains elusive but is likely to involve environmental factors in a genetically primed individual. Pathogenesis is dominated by vascular changes; evidence of autoimmunity with distinct autoantibodies and activation of both innate and adaptive immunity; and fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs that results in irreversible scarring and organ failure. Intractable progression of vascular and fibrotic organ damage accounts for the chronic morbidity and high mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis and classification might improve patient outcomes. Screening strategies facilitate timely recognition of life-threatening complications and initiation of targeted therapies to halt their progression. Effective treatments of organ-based complications are now within reach. Discovery of biomarkers - including autoantibodies that identify patient subsets at high risk for particular disease complications or rapid progression - is a research priority. Understanding the key pathogenetic pathways, cell types and mediators underlying disease manifestations opens the door for the development of targeted therapies with true disease-modifying potential.

Method: Using conversation analytic methods, a video collection of five naturally occurring problematic topic transitions was identified, transcribed and analysed. These were extracted from a main collection of over 200 other-initiated repair sequences and a sub-set of 15 problematic topic transition sequences. The sequences were analysed with reference to how the participants both identified and resolved the problems. Result: Analysis revealed that topic transition by people with dysarthria can prove problematic. Conversation partners may find transitions problematic not only because of speech intelligibility but also because of a sequential disjuncture between the dysarthric speech turn and whatever topic has come prior. In addition the treatment of problematic topic transition as a complaint reveals the potential vulnerability of people with dysarthria to judgements of competence. Conclusion: These findings have implications for how dysarthria is conceptualized and how specific actions in conversation, such as topic transition, might be suitable targets for clinical intervention.",

We used live-cell imaging to demonstrate intercellular \u03b1-syn transfer and used flow cytometry and high content analysis to quantify the transfer. We then successfully inhibited intercellular protein transfer genetically by down-regulating dynamin or pharmacologically using dynasore or heparin. In addition, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells carrying a triplication of the \u03b1-syn gene into dopaminergic neurons. These cells secreted high levels of \u03b1-syn, which was taken up by neighboring neurons. Collectively, our co-culture systems provide simple but physiologically relevant tools for the identification of genetic modifiers or small molecules that inhibit \u03b1-syn cell-to-cell transfer.",

In this paper, we propose reducing the complexity of a blind symbol synchronization technique for direct detection OFDM receivers based on virtual subcarriers by optimizing the number and location of the virtual subcarriers. Compared to the system design in our previous study, this new technique offers a reduction of 92% in the number of virtual subcarriers (from 26 to 2 in a system with 50 data carrying subchannels) resulting in significant savings in complexity with a minimal penalty. Moreover, it offers an increase in the system capacity as more subcarriers can be used to transmit data. The technique was assessed experimentally using a transmission system of direct detection 16-QAM optical OFDM operating at a data rate of 30.65 Gb/s over 23.3 km SSMF with BER of 10-3. Negligible penalty was observed at high received powers. However, at low received powers, the number of averaging symbols had to be increased in order to improve the robustness of the method.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.Interventions to change health-related behaviours typically have modest effects and may be more effective if grounded in appropriate theory. Most theories applied to public health interventions tend to emphasise individual capabilities and motivation, with limited reference to context and social factors. Intervention effectiveness may be increased by drawing on a wider range of theories incorporating social, cultural and economic factors that influence behaviour. The primary aim of this paper is to identify theories of behaviour and behaviour change of potential relevance to public health interventions across four scientific disciplines: psychology, sociology, anthropology and economics. We report in detail the methodology of our scoping review used to identify these theories including which involved a systematic search of electronic databases, consultation with a multidisciplinary advisory group, web searching, searching of reference lists and hand searching of key behavioural science journals. Of secondary interest we developed a list of agreed criteria for judging the quality of the theories. We identified 82 theories and 9 criteria for assessing theory quality. The potential relevance of this wide-ranging number of theories to public health interventions and the ease and usefulness of evaluating the theories in terms of the quality criteria are however yet to be determined.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.Background: Data from an open label randomised controlled trial have suggested possible advantages on both motor and non-motor measures in patients with Parkinson's disease following 12 months exposure to exenatide. Objective: Continued follow up of these same patients was performed to investigate whether these possible advantages persisted in the prolonged absence of this medication. Methods: All participants from an open label, randomised controlled trial of exenatide as a treatment for Parkinson's disease, were invited for a further follow up assessment at the UCL Institute of Neurology. This visit included all 20 individuals who had previously completed twelve months exposure to exenatide 10ug bd and the 24 individuals who had acted as randomised controls. Motor severity of PD was compared after overnight withdrawal of conventional PD medication using blinded video assessment of the MDS-UPDRS, together with several non-motor tests. This assessment was thus 24 months after their original baseline visit, i.e. 12 months after cessation of exenatide. Results: Compared to the control group of patients, patients previously exposed to exenatide had an advantage of 5.6 points (95% CI, 2.2-9.0; p = 0.002) using blinded video rating of the MDS-UPDRS part 3 motor subscale. There was also a difference of 5.3 points; (95% CI, 9.3-1.4; p = 0.006) between the 2 groups on the Mattis Dementia Rating scale. Conclusions: While these data must still not be interpreted as evidence of neuroprotection, they nevertheless provide strong encouragement for the further study of this drug as a potential disease modifying agent in Parkinson's disease.",

Methods: Information was collected from 11 caregivers using semi-structured interviews about their experiences of caring for adults with intellectual disabilities who were suspected or definitely in pain. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Six superordinate themes were identified from participants' experiences: suffering in silence; searching for meaning to explain the complaint,; knowledge and skills needed to recognize and manage pain; perceptions of the pain experience; acting to try and reduce pain; and the emotional impact of pain. Conclusions: There seems an art to detect pain using existing skills and knowledge of the individual's ways of expressing pain. Despite best efforts, recognizing and treating pain was experienced as complex and ambiguous. Some caregivers described a negative emotional impact and dissatisfaction with the management of pain by health care services.",

            "Abstract": "Objective Several genetic risk factors have been identified for non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (NACP). A genome-wide association study reported an association of chronic pancreatitis (CP) with variants in PRSS1-PRSS2 (rs10273639; near the gene encoding cationic trypsinogen) and CLDN2-MORC4 loci (rs7057398 in RIPPLY1 and rs12688220 in MORC4). We aimed to refine these findings in a large European cohort. Design We studied 3062 patients with alcohol-related CP (ACP) or NACP and 5107 controls. Also, 1559 German patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis or alcohol dependence were included for comparison. We performed several meta-analyses to examine genotype- phenotype relationships. Results Association with ACP was found for rs10273639 (OR, 0.63; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.72). ACP was also associated with variants rs7057398 and rs12688220 in men (OR, 2.26; 95% CI 1.94 to 2.63 and OR, 2.66; 95% CI 2.21 to 3.21, respectively) and in women (OR, 1.57; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.18 and OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.07, respectively). Similar results were obtained when German patients with ACP were compared with those with alcohol-associated cirrhosis or alcohol dependence. In the overall population of patients with NACP, association with rs10273639 was absent (OR, 0.93; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01), whereas rs7057398 of the X chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms was associated with NACP in women only (OR, 1.32; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.51). Conclusions The single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs10273639 at the PRSS1-PRSS2 locus and rs7057398 and rs12688220 at the CLDN2-MORC4 locus are associated with CP and strongly associate with ACP, but only rs7057398 with NACP in female patients.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.To utilize spectrum resources more efficiently, dynamic spectrum access attempts to allocate the spectrum to users in an intelligent manner. Uncoordinated sharing with cognitive radio (CR) users is a promising approach for dynamic spectrum access. In the uncoordinated sharing model, CR is an enabling technology that allows the unlicensed or secondary users to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum bands (belonging to the so-called primary users), without any modifications or updates for the licensed systems. However, because of the limited resources for making spectrum observations, spectrum sensing for CR is bound to have errors and will degrade the grade-of-service performance of both primary and secondary users. In this paper, we first propose a new partial spectrum sharing policy, which achieves efficient spectrum sharing between two licensed networks. Then, a Markov chain model is devised to analyze the proposed policy considering the effects of sensing errors. We also construct a cross-layer design framework, in which the parameters of spectrum sharing policy at the multiple-access control layer and the spectrum sensing parameters at the physical layer are simultaneously coordinated to maximize the overall throughput of the networks, while satisfying the grade-of-service constraints of the users. Numerical results show that the proposed spectrum sharing policy and the cross-layer design strategy achieve a much higher overall throughput for the two networks.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Purpose: The longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) measured in vivo depends on the local microstructural properties of the tissue, such as macromolecular, iron, and water content. Here, we use whole brain multiparametric in vivo data and a general linear relaxometry model to describe the dependence of R1 on these components. We explore a) the validity of having a single fixed set of model coefficients for the whole brain and b) the stability of the model coefficients in a large cohort. Methods: Maps of magnetization transfer (MT) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2\u2217) were used as surrogates for macromolecular and iron content, respectively. Spatial variations in these parameters reflected variations in underlying tissue microstructure. A linear model was applied to the whole brain, including gray/ white matter and deep brain structures, to determine the global model coefficients. Synthetic R1 values were then calculated using these coefficients and compared with the measured R1 maps. Results: The model's validity was demonstrated by correspondence between the synthetic and measured R1 values and by high stability of the model coefficients across a large cohort. Conclusion: A single set of global coefficients can be used to relate R1, MT, and R2\u2217 across the whole brain. Our population study demonstrates the robustness and stability of the model.",

            "Abstract": "The objective of this paper was to analyse the challenges and prospects of regional MPA networks as an effective tool for the protection of wide-ranging cetaceans, focusing on the potential of the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI) network initiative to contribute to the conservation of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). One of the main threats to this vulnerable population is mortalities through ship strikes. It is argued that a SPAMI network does not have the potential to effectively reduce the threat of ship strikes on a firm legal, scientific and political basis, particularly given uncertainty over fin whale seasonal movements. Instead, an alternative sectoral approach to landscape-scale protection is discussed. Building on examples from North America, it is proposed that a wider spatial scale threat-based approach should be adopted, and that a regional network of restrictions of shipping activities through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) will more effectively reduce the risk of ship-whale strikes. This is also more consistent with the ecosystem approach, since the emphasis is on ecological scales that cross administrative boundaries, even though it is within a single sector. It is concluded that mechanisms exist to address the challenges of implementing such an approach, and that sectoral measures through the IMO represent an important way forward for improving the conservation prospects for Mediterranean fin whales. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 JASSS.The Schelling model is a simple agent-based model that demonstrates how individuals\u2019 relocation decisions can generate residential segregation in cities. Agents belong to one of two groups and occupy cells of rectangular space. Agents react to the fraction of agents of their own group within the neighborhood around their cell. Agents stay put when this fraction is above a given tolerance threshold but seek a new location if the fraction is below the threshold. The model is well-known for its tipping point behavior: an initially random (integrated) pattern remains integrated when the tolerance threshold is below 1/3 but becomes segregated when the tolerance threshold is above 1/3. In this paper, we demonstrate that the variety of the Schelling model\u2019s steady patterns is richer than the segregation\u2013integration dichotomy and contains patterns that consist of segregated patches of each of the two groups, alongside areas where both groups are spatially integrated. We obtain such patterns by considering a general version of the model in which the mechanisms of the agents' interactions remain the same, but the tolerance threshold varies between the agents of both groups. We show that the model produces patterns of mixed integration and segregation when the tolerance threshold of an essential fraction of agents is either low, below 1/5, or high, above 2/3. The emerging mixed patterns are relatively insensitive to the model\u2019s other parameters.",

It introduces the key concepts of sociology and demonstrates their importance and application to pharmacy practice in the 21st century. It is unique in its role as the only text to introduce sociology specifically to pharmacists. Rather than an exhaustive treatment, the book provides a concise introduction to major perspectives in sociology-drawing on research evidence pertaining to health, illness, and professional practice-which will inform and enhance pharmacy practice. It offers an overview of sociology for rather than sociology of pharmacy, and will both inform practitioners and stimulate informed research into the social aspects of pharmacy practice. Key issues covered include: Key sociological concepts and perspectives Contemporary developments in pharmacy practice and pharmacy's professional status A review of research into the way people react to illness and look after their health How and why illness and disease are influenced by gender, ethnicity, and social class Health education and pharmacists' role in promoting health and ensuring appropriate medicine usage Social research methods Pharmacists are frequently encouraged to broaden their day-to-day practice. This timely book does just that by encouraging pharmacists to become more involved with advising clients, managing medicines, and supporting the promotion of health.

Limitations with autograft, allograft and synthetics have led to research into tissue engineering using scaffolds and mesenchymal stem cells. Objectives: This systematic review aims to examine and summarise the pre clinical in-vivo studies and limited clinical studies on the use of scaffolds in the treatment of ligamentous injuries Data sources: Databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of science, Medline, Cochrane library and Embase. The following key words and search terms were used: scaffolds, ligament, mesenchymal stem cells, tissue engineering, clinical, and preclinical. Methods: A total of 118 articles were reviewed. 19 articles were identified as relevant for the purpose of this systematic literature review. An additional 2 articles were sourced from the reference list of reviewed articles. Results: Three tables of studies were constructed: pre clinical biological scaffolds, pre clinical synthetic scaffolds and clinical scaffolds. Conclusions: There is a large body of pre clinical evidence that the use of scaffolds combined with mesenchymal stem cells can be a viable option in the regeneration of ligamentous structures with biological and mechanical properties suitable for function. There is, however, limited clinical evidence supporting the use of recently developed scaffolds and historical evidence of synthetic scaffolds failing in the management of anterior cruciate ligament repairs. There appears to be no consensus in the literature as to the nature of the scaffold material that is most suitable for clinical trials. No randomised control trials have yet been conducted.",

Methods: Fourteen abdominal imaging experts from the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) participated in a consensus meeting, organised according to an adaptation of the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method. Two independent (non-voting) Chairs facilitated the meeting. 246 items were scored (comprising 229 items from the previous 2012 consensus and 17 additional items) and classified as \u2018appropriate\u2019 or \u2018inappropriate\u2019 (defined by \u2265 80 % consensus) or uncertain (defined by OpenSPiltSPi 80 % consensus). Results: Consensus was reached for 226 (92 %) of items. From these recommendations regarding hardware, patient preparation, imaging sequences and acquisition, criteria for MR imaging evaluation and reporting structure were constructed. The main additions to the 2012 consensus include recommendations regarding use of diffusion-weighted imaging, criteria for nodal staging and a recommended structured report template. Conclusions: These updated expert consensus recommendations should be used as clinical guidelines for primary staging and restaging of rectal cancer using MRI. Key Points: \u2022 These guidelines present recommendations for staging and reporting of rectal cancer. \u2022 The guidelines were constructed through consensus amongst 14 pelvic imaging experts. \u2022 Consensus was reached by the experts for 92 % of the 246 items discussed. \u2022 Practical guidelines for nodal staging are proposed. \u2022 A structured reporting template is presented.",

It has been suggested that contextual cuing relies on associative learning between the distractor locations and the target position. Four experiments examined the effect of pre-exposing configurations of consistent distractors on subsequent contextual cuing. The findings demonstrate a facilitation of subsequent cuing for pre-exposed configurations compared to novel configurations that have not been pre-exposed. This facilitation suggests that learning of repeated visual search patterns involves acquisition of not just distractor-target associations but also associations between distractors within the search context, an effect that is not captured by the Brady and Chun (2007) connectionist model of contextual cuing. We propose a new connectionist model of contextual cuing that learns associations between repeated distractor stimuli, enabling it to predict an effect of pre-exposure on contextual cuing.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the context of obesity, epigenetic mechanisms regulate cell-specific chromatin plasticity, perpetuating gene expression responses to nutrient excess. MacroH2A1, a variant of histone H2A, emerged as a key chromatin regulator sensing small nutrients during cell proliferation and differentiation. Mice genetically ablated for macroH2A1 (knockout (KO)) do not show overt phenotypes under a standard diet. Our objective was to analyse the in vivo role of macroH2A1 in response to nutritional excess. METHODS: Twelve-week-old whole-body macroH2A1 KO male mice were given a high-fat diet (60% energy from lard) for 12 weeks until being killed, and examined for glucose and insulin tolerance, and for body fat composition. Energy expenditure was assessed using metabolic cages and by measuring the expression levels of genes involved in thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) or in adipogenesis in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). RESULTS: Under a chow diet, macroH2A1 KO mice did not differ from their wild-type (WT) littermates for body weight, and for sensitivity to glucose or insulin. However, KO mice displayed decreased heat production (P < 0.05), and enhanced total activity during the night (P < 0.01). These activities related to protection against diet-induced obesity in KO mice, which displayed decreased body weight owing to a specific decrease in fat mass (P < 0.05), increased tolerance to glucose (P < 0.05), and enhanced total activity during the day (P < 0.05), compared with WT mice. KO mice displayed increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ucp1, P < 0.05; Glut4, P < 0.05; Cox4, P < 0.01) in BAT and a decreased expression of adipogenic genes (Ppar\u03b3, P < 0.05; Fabp4, P < 0.05; Glut4, P < 0.05) in VAT compared with WT mice, indicative of augmented energy expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic eviction of macroH2A1 confers protection against diet-induced obesity and metabolic derangements in mice. Inhibition of macroH2A1 might be a helpful strategy for epigenetic therapy of obesity.",

            "DOI": "10.18632/oncotarget.4186",
            "Abstract": "Background/aims: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is ranked as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite recent advances in treatment options, a modest impact on the outcome of the disease is observed so far. Short-term fasting cycles have been shown to potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy against glioma. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of fasting cycles on the efficacy of gemcitabine, a standard treatment for PC patients, in vitro and in an in vivo pancreatic cancer mouse xenograft model. Materials and Methods: BxPC-3, MiaPaca-2 and Panc-1 cells were cultured in standard and fasting mimicking culturing condition to evaluate the effects of gemcitabine. Pancreatic cancer xenograft mice were subjected to 24h starvation prior to gemcitabine injection to assess the tumor volume and weight as compared to mice fed ad libitum. Results: Fasted pancreatic cancer cells showed increased levels of equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1), the transporter of gemcitabine across the cell membrane, and decreased ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) levels as compared to those cultured in standard medium. Gemcitabine was more effective in inducing cell death on fasted cells as compared to controls. Consistently, xenograft pancreatic cancer mice subjected to fasting cycles prior to gemcitabine injection displayed a decrease of more than 40% in tumor growth. Conclusion: Fasting cycles enhance gemcitabine effect in vitro and in the in vivo PC xenograft mouse model. These results suggest that restrictive dietary interventions could enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments in pancreatic cancer patients.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Purpose: A considerable excess of psychosis in black ethnic minorities is apparent from clinical studies, in Britain, as in other developed economies with white majority populations. This excess is not so marked in population surveys. Equitable health service provision should be informed by the best estimates of the excess. We used national survey data to establish the difference in the prevalence of psychosis between black ethnic groups and the white majority in the British general population. Methods: Analysis of the combined datasets (N = 26,091) from the British national mental health surveys of 1993, 2000 and 2007. Cases of psychosis were determined either by the use of the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), or from a combination of screening items. We controlled for sex, age, social class, unemployment, design features and other putative confounders, using a Disease Risk Score. Results: People from black ethnic minorities had an excess prevalence rate of psychosis compared with the white majority population. The OR, weighted for study design and response rate, was 2.72 (95 % CI 1.3\u20135.6, p = 0.002). This was marginally increased after controlling for potential confounders (OR = 2.90, 95 % CI 1.4\u20136.2, p = 0.006). Conclusions: The excess of psychosis in black ethnic minority groups was similar to that in two previous British community surveys, and less than that based on clinical studies. Even so it confirms a considerable need for increased mental health service resources in areas with high proportions of black ethnic minority inhabitants.",

            "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children and adolescents. The resulting increase in the number of patients with NAFLD is expected to translate into increased numbers of patients with liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this context, it is particularly important to identify patients at risk for progressive chronic liver disease. Currently, liver biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to establish the presence and stage of fibrosis. Due to the remarkable increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and the concomitant efforts in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, non-invasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable noninvasive methodologies are needed. This paper provides a concise overview of the role of non-invasive diagnostic tools for the determination of presence and extent of fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with particular emphasis on the methods currently available in clinical practice.",

All rights reserved.Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally and has an incidence of approximately 850,000 new cases per year. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer. The main risk factors for developing HCC are well known and include hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcohol intake and ingestion of the fungal metabolite aflatoxin B1. Additional risk factors such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are also emerging. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC have led to identification of critical driver mutations; however, the most prevalent of these are not yet druggable targets. The molecular classification of HCC is not established, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification is the main clinical algorithm for the stratification of patients according to prognosis and treatment allocation. Surveillance programmes enable the detection of early-stage tumours that are amenable to curative therapies-resection, liver transplantation or local ablation. At more developed stages, only chemoembolization (for intermediate HCC) and sorafenib (for advanced HCC) have shown survival benefits. There are major unmet needs in HCC management that might be addressed through the discovery of new therapies and their combinations for use in the adjuvant setting and for intermediate- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, biomarkers for therapy stratification, patient-tailored strategies targeting driver mutations and/or activating signalling cascades, and validated measurements of quality of life are needed. Recent failures in the testing of systemic drugs for intermediate and advanced stages have indicated a need to refine trial designs and to define novel approaches.",

The data were collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and comprise the full 2011 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb\u22121. Differential cross-sections are presented as a function of the jet multiplicity for up to eight jets using jet transverse momentum thresholds of 25, 40, 60, and 80 GeV, and as a function of jet transverse momentum up to the fifth jet. The results are shown after background subtraction and corrections for all known detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matched to the experimental acceptance. Several QCD-based Monte Carlo models are compared with the results. Sensitivity to the parton shower modelling is found at the higher jet multiplicities, at high transverse momentum of the leading jet and in the transverse momentum spectrum of the fifth leading jet. The MC@NLO+HERWIG MC is found to predict too few events at higher jet multiplicities.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the occipital cortex has a controversial effect on the visual cortex excitability. Paired flash visual evoked potentials (paired F-VEPs) offer a unique method to express neural inhibition within the visual system. However, no studies have explored the effects of tDCS on F-VEPs in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of single- and paired-F-VEPs during and after tDCS in healthy humans. Twenty-six healthy volunteers participated. F-VEPs were recorded from occipital electrodes with closed eyes. Stimuli were single flashes, intermingled to flash pairs at the interstimulus interval of 125, 62.5, 50, 33.3, 16.6, and 11.1 ms (internal frequency of 8, 16, 20, 30, 60, and 90 Hz). The single F-VEP was split into a \"main complex\" and a \"late response.\" As to paired stimuli, the \"test\" F-VEP emerged from electronic subtraction of the single-F-VEP to the paired-F-VEP. In experiment 1, the return electrode was located on the scalp and we studied changes in F-VEPs after anodal, cathodal (1 mA, 15 min) and sham stimulation. A second experiment was performed in which F-VEPs were recorded before, during and after tDCS stimulation (anodal and cathodal) with the return electrode on the neck. F-VEPs recorded in experiment 1 did not detect any significant change after tDCS. In experiment 2 anodal polarization significantly increased the P2 latency (P =.031) and reduced the amplitude of the \"late response\" of the single F-VEP (P =.008). As for the paired F-VEPs, no significant changes were detected. In conclusion, low-intensity anodal tDCS has weak inhibitory aftereffects on the single F-VEP and no effects on the paired F-VEPs. Further methodological studies are needed to improve polarization efficacy.",

A total of 18 samples were collected along a neritic to mid-bathyal transect in Saros Bay at water depths ranging from 15 to 500 m. This study reveals a very highly diversified benthic foraminiferal fauna composed of 267 species belonging to 115 genera. Benthic foraminiferal taxa varied along the depth transect, and it is possible to recognise benthic foraminiferal assemblages typical for different bathymetric ranges. An inner\u2013middle neritic assemblages (ca. <100 m depth), outer neritic assemblages (ca. 100\u2013200 m), and upper bathyal assemblages (200\u2013500 m) are defined. On the basis of the available foraminiferal literature on the Aegean Sea coupled with our data from Saros Bay, a very high number of foraminiferal species is estimated to occur in this basin. A total of 799 species belonging to 276 genera, 93 families and 43 superfamilies have been recorded in the Aegean Sea. These values are remarkably higher than those documented in previous foraminiferal studies carried out in different parts of the Mediterranean Sea. Although the determination of the total foraminiferal diversity in the Mediterranean Sea remains a difficult task, we speculate that this number may be in excess of 1,000.",

All rights reserved.A new understanding of cognitive development from the perspective of neuroscience This book provides a state-of-the-art understanding of the neural bases of cognitive development. Although the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience is still in its infancy, the authors effectively demonstrate that our understanding of cognitive development is and will be vastly improved as the mechanisms underlying development are elucidated. The authors begin by establishing the value of considering neuroscience in order to understand child development and then provide an overview of brain development. They include a critical discussion of experience-dependent changes in the brain. The authors explore whether the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity differ from those underlying adult plasticity, and more fundamentally, what distinguishes plasticity from development. Having armed the reader with key neuroscience basics, the book begins its examination of the neural bases of cognitive development by examining the methods employed by professionals in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Following a brief historical overview, the authors discuss behavioral, anatomic, metabolic, and electrophysiological methods. Finally, the book explores specific content areas, focusing on those areas where there is a significant body of knowledge on the neural underpinnings of cognitive development, including: Declarative and non-declarative memory and learning Spatial cognition Object recognition Social cognition Speech and language development Attention development For cognitive and developmental psychologists, as well as students in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive development, the authors' view of behavioral development from the perspective of neuroscience sheds new light on the mechanisms that underlie how the brain functions and how a child learns and behaves.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Background: Previous studies show that \u2018poor responders\u2019 to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) may be identified on the basis of early postoperative weight loss. Early identification of poor responders could allow earlier provision of postoperative behavioural and/or intensive lifestyle interventions and enhance their maximal weight loss. Our aim was to investigate whether early postoperative weight loss predicts the maximal weight loss response after RYGBP and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Methods: We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1,456 adults who underwent either RYGBP (n = 918) or SG (n = 538) as a primary procedure in one of two European centres. Postoperative weight loss was expressed as weight loss velocity (WLV) and percentage weight loss. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association of early postoperative weight loss with maximal %WL, including adjustment for baseline variables. Results: There was marked variability in maximal %WL following both RYGBP (mean 32.9 %, range 4.1\u201360.9 %) and SG (mean 26.2 %, range 1.1\u201358.3 %). WLV 3\u20136 months postoperatively was more strongly associated with maximal %WL (r2 = 0.32 for RYGBP and r2 = 0.26 for SG, P < 0.001 for both) than either WLV 0\u20136 weeks or 6 weeks to 3 months postoperatively (r2 = 0.14 and 0.10 for RYGBP, respectively; r2 = 0.18 and 0.21 for SG, respectively; P < 0.001 for all). Multiple linear regression analysis, including baseline variables of age, sex, preoperative BMI, type 2 diabetes, ethnicity, and bariatric centre, revealed that 3\u20136 month WLV was an independent predictor of maximal %WL in both SG and RYGBP groups (standardised \u03b2-coefficients 0.51 and 0.52, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Conclusions: There is a marked variability in weight loss response following RYGBP and SG. Early postoperative weight loss can be used to identify patients whose predicted weight loss trajectories are suboptimal. Early targeting of poor responders with more intensive postoperative lifestyle and behavioural support could potentially enhance their weight loss response.",

Healthcare providers' (HCPs) knowledge of and attitudes to PrEP will be key to successful implementation. In England, PrEP is only available to men who have sex with men (MSM) through the open-label randomized PROUD pilot study of immediate or deferred use. Methods: In September 2013, a cross-sectional survey of UK HCPs distributed through sexual health clinics (219) and professional societies' email lists (2599) and at a conference (80) asked about knowledge of, attitudes to and practice of PrEP. Results: Overall, 328 of 2898 (11%) completed the survey, of whom 160 of 328 (49%) were doctors, 51 (16%) sexual health advisers (SHAs), 44 (14%) nurses and 73 (22%) unspecified. Over a quarter (83 of 311; 27%) were involved in PROUD. Most respondents (260 of 326; 80%) rated their knowledge of PrEP as medium or high. Over half of respondents (166 of 307; 54%) thought PrEP should be available outside of a clinical trial. The main barriers to supporting PrEP availability outside a clinical trial were concerns about current evidence (odds ratio [OR] 0.13), lack of UK-specific guidance (OR 0.35), concerns about adherence (OR 0.38) and risk of sexual or physical coercion for patients to have condomless or higher risk sex (OR 0.42 in multivariate regression). Just over half (147 of 277; 53%) had been asked about PrEP by patients in the past year, including almost half of those working in a clinic not involved in the PROUD study (86 of 202; 43%). Conclusions: There is support for PrEP availability outside a clinical trial, but HCPs have residual concerns about its effectiveness and negative consequences, and the absence of UK-specific implementation guidance.",

Planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on a sample of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) in the important and relatively unexplored observational band between 30 and 857 GHz. Planck enables the assembly of comprehensive PNe spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from radio to far-IR frequencies. Modelling the derived SEDs provides us with information on physical properties of CSEs and the mass content of both main components: ionized gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm-mm waves; and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-IR emission. In particular, the amount of ionized gas and dust has been derived here. Such quantities have also been estimated for the very young PN CRL? 618, where the strong variability observed in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented constructing its SED. A morphological study of the Helix Nebula was also performed. Planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatial distribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify different components, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to 1? pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium.",

Semistructured interviews following results from consultations with 10 breast/ovarian cancer patients and 22 relatives were audio-recorded and transcribed. Information provided by the genetics health professional was tracked through the families and coded for accuracy. Accuracy was analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test. Sources of information were tested using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient. Fifty-three percent of the information recalled by patients was accurate. Accuracy of recall among relatives was significantly lower than that among patients (P = 0.017). Both groups recalled a lower proportion of information about hereditary cancer than about genetics (P = 0.005). Relatives who learnt the information from the patient alone recalled significantly less accurate information than those informed directly by genetics health professionals (P = 0.001). Following genetic counselling about a BRCA1/2 mutation, accuracy of recall was low among patients and relatives, particularly about hereditary cancer. Multiple sources of information, including direct contact with genetics health professionals, may improve the accuracy of information among relatives.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research on action observation has emphasized the role of putative mirror neuron areas such as Broca's area, ventral premotor cortex, and the inferior parietal lobule. However, recent evidence suggests action observation involves many distributed cortical regions, including dorsal premotor and superior parietal cortex. How these different regions relate to traditional mirror neuron areas, and whether traditional mirror neuron areas play a special role in action representation, is unclear. Here we use multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to show that action representations, including observation, imagery, and execution of reaching movements: (1) are distributed across both dorsal (superior) and ventral (inferior) premotor and parietal areas; (2) can be decoded from areas that are jointly activated by observation, execution, and imagery of reaching movements, even in cases of equalamplitude blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses; and (3) can be equally accurately classified from either posterior parietal or frontal (premotor and inferior frontal) regions. These results challenge the presumed dominance of traditional mirror neuron areas such as Broca's area in action observation and action representation more generally. Unlike traditional univariate fMRI analyses, MVPA was able to discriminate between imagined and observed movements from previously indistinguishable BOLD activations in commonly activated regions, suggesting finer-grained distributed patterns of activation.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aims and Objectives: To explore the effect contact with a heart failure nurse can have on patients' illness beliefs, mood and quality of life. Background: There is growing interest in patients' illness beliefs and the part they play in a patients understanding of chronic disease. Design: Secondary analysis on two independent datasets. Patients were recruited from five UK hospitals, four in London and one in Sussex. Patients were recruited from an inpatient and outpatient setting. The first dataset recruited 174 patients with newly diagnosed heart failure, whilst the second dataset recruited 88 patients with an existing diagnosis of heart failure. Methods: Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Treatment Representations Inventory at baseline and six months. We used a linear regression model to assess the association that contact with a heart failure nurse had on mood, illness beliefs and quality of life over a six-month period. Results: Patients who had contact with a heart failure nurse were more satisfied with their treatment and more likely to believe that their heart failure was treatable. Contact with a heart failure nurse did not make a statistically significant difference to mood or quality of life. Conclusions: This study has shown that contact with a heart failure nurse can improve patient satisfaction with treatment decisions but has less influence on a patient's beliefs about their personal control, treatment control and treatment concerns. With appropriate support, skills and training, heart failure nurses could play an important role in addressing individual patient's beliefs. There is a need to further investigate this. Relevance to clinical practice: Exploring patients' illness beliefs and mood could help to enhance person-centred care. Heart failure nurses would need additional training in the techniques used.",

All rights reserved.Background Patients requiring surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer often additionally undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT), of which the effects on physical fitness are unknown. The aim of this feasibility and pilot study was to investigate the effects of NACRT and a 6 week structured responsive exercise training programme (SRETP) on oxygen uptake (VO2) at lactate threshold (\u03b8L) in such patients. Methods We prospectively studied 39 consecutive subjects (27 males) with T3-4/N+ resection margin threatened rectal cancer who completed standardized NACRT. Subjects underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline (pre-NACRT), at week 0 (post-NACRT), and week 6 (post-SRETP). Twenty-two subjects undertook a 6 week SRETP on a training bike (three sessions per week) between week 0 and week 6 (exercise group). These were compared with 17 contemporaneous non-randomized subjects (control group). Changes in VO2 at \u03b8L over time and between the groups were compared using a compound symmetry covariance linear mixed model. Results Of 39 recruited subjects, 22 out of 22 (exercise) and 13 out of 17 (control) completed the study. There were differences between the exercise and control groups at baseline [age, ASA score physical status, World Health Organisation performance status, and Colorectal Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (CR-POSSUM) predicted mortality]. In all subjects, VO2 at \u03b8L significantly reduced between baseline and week 0 [-1.9 ml kg-1 min-1; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3, -2.6; P<0.0001]. In the exercise group, VO2 at \u03b8L significantly improved between week 0 and week 6 (+2.1 ml kg-1 min-1; 95% CI +1.3, +2.9; P<0.0001), whereas the control group values were unchanged (-0.7 ml kg-1 min-1; 95% CI -1.66, +0.37; P=0.204). Conclusions NACRT before rectal cancer surgery reduces physical fitness. A structured exercise intervention is feasible post-NACRT and returns fitness to baseline levels within 6 weeks.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.Azokh Cave in the Karabakh range of the Lesser Caucasus has yielded one of the richest small mammal assemblages yet reported from the entire Caucasus region. Over 2770 dental and cranial remains from at least 24 taxa of insectivore, rodent and lagomorph have been studied from the Middle/Late Pleistocene (Units II\u2013V) and Holocene (Unit 1) deposits at Azokh 1. Holocene samples were also studied from Azokh 5. The small mammal assemblages are dominated throughout by arvicoline rodents indicative of dry steppes and semi-deserts. Notable species include several regionally extinct arid-adapted or montane taxa, such as Ochotona (pika), Marmota sp. (marmot), Spermophilus sp. (ground squirrel), Chionomys nivalis (snow vole) and Allactaga spp. (jerboa). Hamsters (Mesocricetus sp., Cricetulus migratorius), jirds (Meriones spp.) and mole voles (Ellobius sp.) are also well represented throughout the sequence. Habitat preferences of extant representatives of the rodent and lagomorph fauna suggest that the landscape surrounding the cave was dominated by grassland/steppe interspersed with rocky ground. Small mammals that prefer more humid conditions and woodland or scrub vegetation are present as rare components of the Pleistocene fauna. Unit Vu has yielded the earliest Caucasian record of rat (Rattus sp.), a species previously thought to have been a relatively recent (late Holocene) introduction. Several species recovered from the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits are now scarce or no longer live in the region, adding to evidence for distributional changes of these taxa in the latter part of the Pleistocene and Holocene. The small mammal fauna shows broad similarities to those from semi-desert and steppe regions to the south, implying dispersals from the adjacent parts of Asia; there appear to be only tenuous links with the Pleistocene small mammals north of the Caucasus.",

All rights reserved.Background: The phase 3 studies of telaprevir (T) in combination with peginterferon \u03b1-2a and ribavirin (PR) in treatmentnaive genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus-infected patients (ADVANCE/ILLUMINATE) were not designed a priori to assess the effect of race and ethnicity on treatment response. However, these factors are important given the lower sustained virologic response (SVR) rates observed in black and Hispanic/Latino patients treated with PR. Goals: This retrospective pooled analysis evaluated the effect of race or ethnicity on treatment-naive patient response to telaprevirbased therapy and assessed resistant variant profiles. Materials and Methods: This analysis comprised patients enrolled in ADVANCE (N=363) and ILLUMINATE (N=540) who received 12 weeks of telaprevir in combination with PR followed by 12 or 36 weeks of PR alone and patients in ADVANCE (N=361) who received 48 weeks of PR alone. Race and ethnicity were selfreported and not mutually exclusive. Results: Higher SVR rates were observed with telaprevir-based therapy compared with PR in blacks [n=99 (62%) vs. n=28 (29%), respectively] and in Hispanics/Latinos [n=89 (72%) vs. n=38 (39%)]. The SVR was lower in telaprevir-treated blacks [n=99 (62%)] compared with nonblacks [n=791 (78%)] and in Hispanic/Latinos compared with non-Hispanics/Latinos [n=89 (72%) vs. n=801 (76%)]. Low discontinuation rates due to adverse events, including rash and anemia, were observed across subgroups. Resistance profiles were similar among the subgroups. Conclusions: Treatment-naive black and Hispanic/Latino patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection may benefit from telaprevir-based therapy, an important finding given the lower SVR rates observed in these patients when they are treated with PR alone.",

NAATs are now widely used, and have become the preferred tools for detecting and screening for STIs. This is largely due to their enhanced sensitivity and specificity over more traditional methods, and the ability to process non-invasive test samples such as urine samples or self-collected vaginal swabs. However, in order to provide accurate diagnostic results NAATs must be rigorously evaluated for specificity, reproducibility, analytic and clinical validity, and cost before they can be recommended for screening of general populations. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Aims: This paper has two goals: first, to increase awareness and understanding of the limitations of therapy study designs and statistical techniques and, second, to suggest some designs and statistical techniques likely to produce intervention studies that can inform both theories of therapy and service provision. Main Contribution & Conclusions: We recommend a single-case experimental design that incorporates the following features. First, there should be random allocation of stimuli to treated and control conditions with matching for baseline performance, using relatively large stimulus sets to increase confidence in the data. Second, prior to intervention, baseline testing should occur on at least two occasions. Simulations show that termination of the baseline phase should not be contingent on \u201cstability.\u201d For intervention, a predetermined number of sessions are required (rather than performance-determined duration). Finally, treatment effects must be significantly better than expected by chance to be confident that the results reflect change greater than random variation. Appropriate statistical analysis is important: by-item statistical analysis methods are strongly recommended and a methodology is presented using WEighted STatistics (WEST).",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of nonoperative treatment of acute nonperforated appendicitis with antibiotics in children. Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial was performed comparing nonoperative treatment with antibiotics versus surgery for acute appendicitis in children. Patients with imaging-confirmed acute nonperforated appendicitis who would normally have had emergency appendectomy were randomized either to treatment with antibiotics or to surgery. Follow-up was for 1 year. Results: Fifty patientswere enrolled; 26were randomized to surgery and 24 to nonoperative treatment with antibiotics. All children in the surgery group had histopathologically confirmed acute appendicitis, and therewere no significant complications in this group. Two of 24 patients in the nonoperative treatment group had appendectomy within the time of primary antibiotic treatment and 1 patient after 9months for recurrent acute appendicitis. Another 6 patients have had an appendectomy due to recurrent abdominal pain (n=5) or parental wish (n = 1) during the follow-up period; none of these 6 patients had evidence of appendicitis on histopathological examination. Conclusions: Twenty-two of 24 patients (92%) treated with antibiotics had initial resolution of symptoms. Of these 22, only 1 patient (5%) had recurrence of acute appendicitis during follow-up. Overall, 62% of patients have not had an appendectomy during the follow-up period. This pilot trial suggests that nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis in children is feasible and safe and that further investigation of nonoperative treatment is warranted.",

Nose and throat (NT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were analyzed for microbial profile and expressed as cumulative mean microorganisms per patient (MMP).Results: Forty-three patients (median age\u00b1SD 15.02\u00b131.76 months) underwent STP and 141 patients underwent cardiothoracic but no airway surgery (median age \u00b1SD31.7\u00b147.2 months). Sixteen patients required a stent after STP One-hundred seventy-two positive microbial specimens were identified. The predominant 6 microorganisms were (1) Staphylococcus aureus; (2) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; (3) Haemophilus influenzae not type B; (4) Coliforms; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; and (6) Candida Albicans, and accounted for 128 (74%) of all positive specimens found. Children with stents had more MMP compared to children without stents after STP [4.06\u00b12.38 and 2.04\u00b12.24 MMP (P<0.001), respectively]. Both groups of children after STP had more MMP compared to the control group (P< 0.001). Children with stents had more microbial colonization of their lower respiratory tract compared to their upper respiratory tract (3.36\u00b12.02 and 1.36\u00b10.93 MMP (P<0.01) respectively). Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the lower respiratory tract was significantly higher in children with stents compared to children without stents after STP [0.5 and 0.15 MMP (P<0.05) respectively].Conclusions: This study indicates airway surgery and the subsequent use of stents to be a significant risk factor for microbial colonization of the airway in children. More specifically airway stents appear to increase colonization in the distal airway, which appears unrelated to that of the upper respiratory tract.",

The experimental data were obtained in a horizontal 14. mmID acrylic pipe, for test oil and water superficial velocities ranging from 0.02. m/s to 0.51. m/s and from 0.05. m/s to 0.62. m/s, respectively. Using conductance probes, average interface heights were obtained at the pipe centre and close to the pipe wall, which revealed a concave interface shape in all cases studied. A correlation between the two heights was developed that was used in the two-fluid model. In addition, from the time series of the probe signal at the pipe centre, the average wave amplitude was calculated to be 0.0005. m and was used as an equivalent roughness in the interfacial shear stress model. Both the interface shape and roughness were considered in the two-fluid model together with literature interfacial shear stress correlations. Results showed that the inclusion of both the interface curvature and the equivalent roughness in the two-fluid model improved its predictions of pressure drop and interface height over the range of studied superficial oil and water velocities. Compared to the two-fluid model with other interfacial shear stress correlations, the modified model performed better particularly for predicting pressure drop.",

The issue is timely because prices on raw material markets had been sky scraping since 2000 and are back on lower levels, mainly because of the financial crisis. The chapter seeks to test the hypothesis that resource productivity leads to an enhancement of competitiveness through lowering material purchasing costs and through developing new products and services that lower the overall resource intensity. It demonstrates that in general there is a positive relation between competitiveness of economies and their resource productivity. This is likely to be due to a number of factors: the importance of material purchasing costs for manufacturing industry, the ability to innovate, the macroeconomic environment and technological progress.",

Design and Setting A prospective cohort study of British civil servants who responded to a self-administered questionnaire in middle-age and at older ages, 21 years later. Participants The study sample consisted of 3,939 Whitehall II Study participants (2,789 men, 1,150 women; mean age 67.6 years at follow-up) who were employed at baseline and retired at follow-up. Measurements Midlife adversity was assessed by self-reported socioeconomic adversity (low occupational position; poor standard of living) and psychosocial adversity (high job strain; few close relationships). Symptoms of depression post-retirement were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Results After adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related covariates at baseline and follow-up, there were strong associations between midlife adversities and post-retirement depressive symptoms: low occupational position (odds ratio [OR]: 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.51), poor standard of living (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.66-3.39), high job strain (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.09-2.14), and few close relationships (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.12-2.03). The strength of the associations between socioeconomic, psychosocial, work-related, or non-work related exposures and depressive symptoms was similar. Conclusions Robust associations from observational data suggest that several socioeconomic and psychosocial risk factors for symptoms of depression post-retirement can be detected already in midlife.",

To examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and delay to a pediatric rheumatology clinic, disease severity, and illness perception in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in England. Methods. Using the Index of Multiple Deprivation, 923 consecutive children from the Childhood Arthritis Prospective Study were assigned to SES groups: high-SES (19.1%), middle-SES (44.5%), or low-SES (36.4%). At baseline, disease activity was assessed, and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ), the Illness Perception Questionnaire, and the Child Health Questionnaire, version Parent Form 50, were completed. Linear median regression analyses or zero-inflated negative binominal (ZINB) regression analyses were used. Results. Delay to first pediatric rheumatology consultation was the same between the 3 SES groups. Although disease activity scores assessed by the pediatric rheumatologist did not differ between the 3 SES groups, persons in the low-SES group recorded higher C-HAQ scores compared to the high-SES group (zero-inflated part of ZINB odds ratio 0.28 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.14, 0.55], count part of ZINB \u03b2 0.26 [95% CI 0.05, 0.48]). Parents with low SES also reported more often that their children's school work or activities with friends had been limited. Furthermore, the low-SES group had a worse perception about the consequences of the disease and the effect of treatment than those in the high-SES group. Conclusion. Patients from a low-SES background report more problems with daily activities and have a lower perception of the consequences of the disease than patients from a high-SES background, warranting special attention from a multidisciplinary team.",

The p + Pb collision centrality is characterised by the total transverse energy measured in the Pb-going direction of the forward calorimeter. The charged-particle pseudorapidity distributions are found to vary strongly with centrality, with an increasing asymmetry between the proton-going and Pb-going directions as the collisions become more central. Three different estimations of the number of nucleons participating in the p + Pb collision have been carried out using the Glauber model as well as two Glauber\u2013Gribov inspired extensions to the Glauber model.

This is due to an on-going inability to produce a suitable tissue engineered substrate that can satisfactorily replicate the epidermal and dermal in vivo niches to fulfil both aesthetic and functional demands. The current gold standard treatment of autologous skin grafting is inadequate because of poor textural durability, scarring and associated contracture, and because of a paucity of donor sites in larger burns. Tissue engineering has seen exponential growth in recent years with a number of 'off-the-shelf' dermal and epidermal substitutes now available. Each has its own limitations. In this review, we examine normal wound repair in relation to stem/progenitor cells that are intimately involved in this process within the dermal niche. Endothelial precursors, in particular, are examined closely and their phenotype, morphology and enrichment from multiple sources are described in an attempt to provide some clarity regarding the controversy surrounding their classification and role in vasculogenesis. We also review the role of the next generation of cellularized scaffolds and smart biomaterials that attempt to improve the revascularisation of artificial grafts, the rate of wound healing and the final cosmetic and functional outcome.",

            "Abstract": "Background: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are essential for combating infectious disease. However, high levels are associated with a range of diseases and/or poor health behaviours, such as autoimmune diseases, chronic infection, HIV and excessive alcohol consumption. In the present analyses, we extend this body of work by examining whether higher levels of serum Ig G, A and M are associated with increased mortality risk. Methods: Participants were 4255 Vietnam-era, former US army personnel (the Vietnam Experience Study). From military service files, telephone interviews in 1983 and a medical examination in 1986, sociodemographic, and health data were collected. Contemporary morning fasted blood samples were taken from which IgG, IgA and IgM concentrations were determined. Mortality surveillance over 15 years gave rise to deaths ascribed to all-causes, cardiovascular disease mortality, all cancers combined mortality, external cause and 'other' causes (predominantly comprising deaths due to infectious disease). Cox proportional hazard models were utilised to compute HRs per SD increase in Ig which were first adjusted for age and then additionally adjusting for a range of candidate confounders. Results: In multiply adjusted analyses, in general, the higher the immunoglobulin concentration, the greater the risk of death. Thus, IgA (HR=2.0 95% CI 1.47 to 2.73), IgM (HR=1.5 95% CI 1.11 to 1.91) and IgG (HR=5.8 95% CI 3.38 to 9.95) were positively related to all-cause mortality. Corresponding results for 'other' causes of mortality were 4.7 (2.64 to 8.19), 3.5 (2.29 to 5.45) and 33.4 (15.13 to 73.64). Conclusions: In the present study, high levels of Ig are associated with an elevated risk of death from total and 'other' causes, mainly infectious disease. High levels of Ig, particularly IgG, may signal subclinical disease.",

            "Abstract": "Structured sparsity approaches have recently received much attention in the statistics, machine learning, and signal processing communities. A common strategy is to exploit or assume prior information about structural dependencies inherent in the data; the solution is encouraged to behave as such by the inclusion of an appropriate regularisation term which enforces structured sparsity constraints over sub-groups of data. An important variant of this idea considers the tree-like dependency structures often apparent in wavelet decompositions. However, both the constituent groups and their associated weights in the regularisation term are typically defined a priori. We here introduce an adaptive wavelet denoising framework whereby a sparsity-inducing regulariser is modified based on information extracted from the signal itself. In particular, we use the same wavelet decomposition to detect the location of salient features in the signal, such as jumps or sharp bumps. Given these locations, the weights in the regulariser associated to the groups of coefficients that cover these time locations are modified in order to favour retention of those coefficients. Denoising experiments show that, not only does the adaptive method preserve the salient features better than the non-adaptive constraints, but it also delivers significantly better shrinkage over the signal as a whole. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center.Background: Given the evidence that reasoning biases contribute to delusional persistence and change, several research groups have made systematic efforts to modify them. The current experiment tested the hypothesis that targeting reasoning biases would result in change in delusions. Methods: One hundred and one participants with current delusions and schizophrenia spectrum psychosis were randomly allocated to a brief computerized reasoning training intervention or to a control condition involving computer-based activities of similar duration. The primary hypotheses tested were that the reasoning training intervention, would improve (1) data gathering and belief flexibility and (2) delusional thinking, specifically paranoia. We then tested whether the changes in paranoia were mediated by changes in data gathering and flexibility, and whether working memory and negative symptoms moderated any intervention effects. Results: On an intention-to-treat analysis, there were significant improvements in state paranoia and reasoning in the experimental compared with the control condition. There was evidence that changes in reasoning mediated changes in paranoia, although this effect fell just outside the conventional level of significance after adjustment for baseline confounders. Working memory and negative symptoms significantly moderated the effects of the intervention on reasoning. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of a brief reasoning intervention in improving both reasoning processes and paranoia. It thereby provides proof-of-concept evidence that reasoning is a promising intermediary target in interventions to ameliorate delusions, and thus supports the value of developing this approach as a longer therapeutic intervention.",

This is because taking into account the impact of trading in the market is mathematically equivalent to introducing a regularization on the risk measure. We show here that the impact function determines which regularizer is to be used. We also show that any regularizer based on the norm \u2113p with p > 1 makes the sensitivity of coherent risk measures to estimation error disappear, while regularizers with p < 1 do not. The \u21131 norm represents a border case: its \"soft\" implementation does not remove the instability, but rather shifts its locus, whereas its \"hard\" implementation (including hard limits or a ban on short selling) eliminates it. We demonstrate these effects on the important special case of expected shortfall (ES) which has recently become the global regulatory market risk measure.",

The results show that the Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree can outperform other methods, being able to retrieve more information with fewer clusters.

However, the literature on these conditions is lled with a confusing plethora of terms, which can make these developments dicult to follow for the non-expert. Central to this problem is a lack of clarity as to the intended level of description (clinical syndrome versus clinicopathological entity versus specic histological diagnosis) and a lack of concordance between these levels. For example, while some labels denote a clinical syndrome without specic histological implications (e.g. progressive aphasia, semantic dementia or dementia of frontal type), others denote specic neuropathological entities (e.g. PiD or familial tauopathy), hybrid clinicopathological entities (e.g. FTD) or even specic genetic disorders (e.g. FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17). Recent dierences in opinion over terminology are well illustrated by the titles of the following books, all published in the last decade: Pick\u2019s Disease and Pick Complex (Kertesz and Munoz, 1998), Frontotemporal Dementia (Pasquier et al., 1996), Fronto-Temporal Lobar Degeneration: Fronto-Temporal Dementia, Progressive Aphasia, Semantic Dementia (Snowden et al., 1996) Frontotemporal Dementia Syndromes (Hodges, 2007). is lack of clarity is acknowledged and eorts to rationalize terminology and achieve clinicopathological and nosological consensus have been made (Brun et al., 1994; Neary et al., 1998; McKhann et al., 2001; Kertesz et al., 2003b).",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2015.Introduction The term of the art \u2018brands\u2019 is often used in EU Competition law with the aim of providing factual information on the competitive, or not, relation between products or services provided by different economic actors. The European Commission often refers in its merger or antitrust decisions to the products (or services) of brand X that enter into competition on a relevant market with the products (or services) of brand Y. The term brand used in this context aims to provide a factual observation on the operation of the specific relevant market. No further inferences are made. Inquiring into the role of brands in this context is a simple exercise and offers little to the research question explored in this volume. However, the issue becomes more complex if one engages with the use of brands as an operational concept in EU competition law. Operational concepts connect theoretical concepts to simple factual observations. For instance, the operational concept of \u2018market power\u2019 connects a fact concerning the level of prices in a specific market at a certain point in time, which is partially an observable fact, with the theoretical construction of price theory, for instance the theoretical concept of monopoly or its antithesis, that of perfect competition, from which market power is a departure. These operational concepts help decision-makers to make inferences (they serve as analytical shortcuts) about the relation between the different facts they observe in order to assess causal relations and make predictions. It is now accepted that competition law makes extensive use of operational concepts transplanted from the discipline of economics, in particular neoclassical price theory. Yet its receptivity to operational concepts developed in other disciplines, management studies in particular, has been relatively limited. And here lies the core of the problem with regard to the engagement of EU competition law with the concept of \u2018brands\u2019. Although the discipline of economics and in particular neoclassical price theory perceives brands as a fact of economic life, until recently price theory has not made use of the term as an operational concept. Instead, economists prefer to focus on the semi-operational concepts of product differentiation, advertising or that of barriers to entry, which describe the consequences of the existence of brands, but do not engage directly with the concept of brand.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2007. Epilepsy is a disorder with recurrent epileptic seizures. Corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of children with epilepsy and have significant adverse effects. Their efficacy and tolerability have not been clearly established. Objectives: To determine the efficacy, in terms of seizure control, improvements in cognition and in quality of life and tolerability of steroids compared to placebo or other antiepileptic drugs in children with epilepsy, excluding epileptic spasms. Search methods: We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (1 August 2014); CENTRAL, (The Cochrane Library Issue 7, July 2014); MEDLINE (1946 to 1 August 2014); EMBASE (1966 to December 2004); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE; Issue 3 of the database published in The Cochrane Library Issue 7, July 2014); ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (1 August 2014). We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials of administration of corticosteroids to children (less than 16 years) with epilepsy. Data collection and analysis: For this update two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included cessation of seizures, reduction in seizure frequency, improvement in cognition, quality of life and adverse effects of steroids. Main results: A single RCT was included that recruited five children in a double blind cross-over trial. One child was withdrawn prematurely from the study and another had infantile spasms and hence was excluded from further analysis. Adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH 4-9) was administered. Of the three children analysed, one showed a reduction in seizures of 25% to 50% at both the low and higher doses of corticosteroids compared to placebo; one child showed a reduction in seizures at the higher dose only and one child showed no reduction in seizures at either dose. No adverse effects were reported. Authors' conclusions: Since the last version of this review no new evidence has been found for the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating childhood epilepsies. Clinicians using steroids in childhood epilepsies, other than for epileptic spasms, should take this into account before using these agents.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Hearing relies on the mechanosensory inner and outer hair cells (OHCs) of the organ of Corti, which convert mechanical deflections of their actin-rich stereociliary bundles into electrochemical signals. Several actin-associated proteins are essential for stereocilia formation and maintenance, and their absence leads to deafness. One of the most abundant actin-bundling proteins of stereocilia is plastin 1, but its function has never been directly assessed. Here, we found that plastin 1 knock-out (Pls1 KO) mice have a moderate and progressive form of hearing loss across all frequencies. Auditory hair cells developed normally in Pls1 KO, but in young adult animals, the stereocilia of inner hair cells were reduced in width and length. The stereocilia of OHCs were comparatively less affected; however, they also showed signs of degeneration in ageing mice. The hair bundle stiffness and the acquisition of the electrophysiological properties of hair cells were unaffected by the absence of plastin 1, except for a significant change in the adaptation properties, but not the size of the mechanoelectrical transducer currents. These results show that in contrast to other actin-bundling proteins such as espin, harmonin or Eps8, plastin 1 is dispensable for the initial formation of stereocilia. However, the progressive hearing loss and morphological defects of hair cells in adult Pls1 KO mice point at a specific role for plastin 1 in the preservation of adult stereocilia and optimal hearing. Hence, mutations in the human PLS1 gene may be associated with relatively mild and progressive forms of hearing loss.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: Theoretical models of depression and bipolar disorder emphasise the importance of positive mental imagery in mood and behaviour. Distressing, intrusive images are common in psychosis; however, little is known about positive imagery experiences or their association with clinical symptoms. The aim of the current study was to examine the phenomenology of positive imagery in early psychosis and the relationship between the characteristics of positive, future-oriented imagery and symptom severity. Method: Characteristics, thematic content and appraisals of recent self-reported images were examined in 31 people with early psychosis. The vividness and perceived likelihood of deliberately generated, future-oriented images were investigated in relation to clinical symptoms. Results: Eighty-four percent of participants reported experiencing a recent positive image. Themes included the achievement of personal goals, spending enjoyable time with peers and family, loving, intimate relationships and escape from current circumstances. The vividness and perceived likelihood of generated prospective imagery were negatively correlated with levels of depression and social anxiety. Conclusions: The relationship between emotional problems and the ability to imagine positive, future events may have implications for motivation, mood and goal-directed behaviour in psychosis. Everyday experiences of positive imagery may represent the simulation of future goals, attempts to cope or avoid aversive experiences or idealised fantasy. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: The majority of participants experienced a recent positive image with themes related to goal attainment and social relationships. Depression and social anxiety levels were correlated with the vividness of intentionally generated positive future-oriented images and their perceived likelihood. The assessment of positive imagery in early psychosis appears warranted and may provide insights regarding individual coping strategies, values and goals.",

This study explores the validity of a suite of competence frameworks for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), humanistic, and psychodynamic therapies developed to aid the transportation process. Experienced psychological therapists (N = 111) undertook a Q-sort of 100 items, drawn from frameworks representing each of the modalities and including a set of pantheoretical generic competences, rating items as characteristic or uncharacteristic of their orientation. There were significant differences in the way competences were assigned, with practitioners strongly favoring items from their own modality framework and eschewing items from the others. These results confirm the validity of the items within the frameworks; their utility and application is discussed.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014.Objective. IgG aPL against domain I of \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI) [anti-DI (aDI)] is associated with the pathogenesis of APS, an autoimmune disease defined by thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. To date, however, no study has demonstrated direct pathogenicity of IgG aDI in vivo. In this proof-of-concept study, we designed a novel system to affinity purify polyclonal aDI aPL in order to assess its prothrombotic ability in a well-characterized mouse microcirculation model for APS. Methods. Two polyclonal IgG fractions were isolated from serum of a patient with APS, both with high aPL activity but differing in aDI activity (aDI-rich and aDI-poor). These IgG fractions were tested for their pathogenic ability in an in vivo mouse model of thrombosis. Male CD1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with either aDIrich or aDI-poor IgG; as a control, IgG isolated from healthy serum was used. A pinch injury was applied to the right femoral vein and thrombus dynamics and tissue factor activity in isolated tissue were evaluated. Results. Both aDI-rich and aDI-poor IgG retained aCL and anti-\u03b22GPI activity, while only aDI-rich IgG displayed high aDI activity, as defined by our in-house cut-offs for positivity in each assay. aDI-rich IgG induced significantly larger thrombi in vivo compared with aDI-poor IgG (P<0.0001). Similarly, aDI-rich IgG significantly enhanced the procoagulant activity of carotid artery endothelium and peritoneal macrophages isolated from experimental animals (P<0.01). Conclusion. These data directly demonstrate that the ability to cause thrombosis in vivo is concentrated in the aDI fraction of aPL.",

It discusses a number of novel elements, such as the intensification of spent fuel reprocessing and the use of ionic liquids as green alternatives to organic solvents. The use of ionic liquids in two-phase liquid-liquid separation is new to the Multiphase Flow community, and has proved to be challenging, especially in small channels, because of the surface and interfacial properties involved, which are very different to those of common organic solvents. Numerical studies have been also performed to couple the hydrodynamics at small scale with the mass transfer. The numerical results, taken together with scale-up studies, are used to evaluate the applicability of the small-scale units in reprocessing large volumes of nuclear waste.",

The primary mirror requirements are: main wavelength of 935.5 nm, RMS corrected wavefront error of \u03bb/6, optical surface roughness better than 5 nm, areal density of less than 16 kg/m2 and 1-2 mirror shape corrections per orbit. The primary mirror consists of 7 segments - a central hexagonal mirror and 6 square mirror petals which unfold to form the 4-meter diameter aperture. The focus of the UK LATT consortium for this European Space Agency (ESA) funded project is on using lightweighted aluminium or carbon-fibre-composite materials for the mirror substrate in preference to more traditional materials such as glass and ceramics; these materials have a high strength and stiffness to weight ratio, significantly reducing risk of damage due to launch forces and subsequent deployment in orbit. We present an overview of the design, which includes suitable actuators for wavefront correction, petal deployment mechanisms and lightweight mirror technologies. Preliminary testing results from manufactured lightweight mirror samples will also be summarised.",

Two experienced readers, unaware of the results with the other modalities, interpreted the PET/MR images independently. Discordances were resolved in consensus. PET/MR TNM staging was compared to surgical staging from thoracotomy as the reference standard in 33 patients. In the remaining 17 nonsurgical patients, TNM was determined based on histology from biopsy, imaging results (CT and PET/CT) and follow-up. ROC curve analysis was used to assess accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the PET/MR in assessing the surgical resectability of primary tumour. The kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement in the PET/MR TNM staging. Two different readers, without knowledge of the PET/MR findings, subsequently separately reviewed the PET/CT images for TNM staging. The generalized kappa statistic was used to determine intermodality agreement between PET/CT and PET/MR for TNM staging.Results: ROC curve analysis showed that PET/MR had a specificity of 92.3 % and a sensitivity of 97.3 % in the determination of resectability with an AUC of 0.95. Interobserver agreement in PET/MR reading ranged from substantial to perfect between the two readers (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.646 \u2013 1) for T stage, N stage and M stage. Intermodality agreement between PET/CT and PET/MR ranged from substantial to almost perfect for T stage, N stage and M stage (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.627 \u2013 0.823).Conclusion: In lung cancer patients PET/MR appears to be a robust technique for preoperative staging.Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of PET/MR in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.",

Even the assessment of growth between two ages is not as simple as subtracting the first measurement from the second, for example. This article provides an overview of the key analytical strategies available to human biologists in increasing order of complexity, starting with a review on how to express cross-sectional measurements of size, before covering growth (conditional regression models, regression with conditional growth measures), growth curves (individual growth curves, mixed effects growth curves, latent growth curves), and patterns of growth (growth mixture modeling). The article is not a statistical treatise and has been written by a human biologist for human biologists; as such, it should be accessible to anyone with training in at least basic statistics. A summary table linking each analytical strategy to its applications is provided to help investigators match their hypotheses and measurement schedules to an analysis plan. In addition, worked examples using data on non-Hispanic white participants in the Fels Longitudinal Study are used to illustrate how the analytical strategies might be applied to gain novel insight into human growth and its determinants and consequences. All too often, serial measurements are treated as cross-sectional in analyses that do not harness the power of longitudinal data. The broad goal of this article is to encourage the rigorous application of longitudinal statistical methods to human growth research.",

            "DOI": "10.1016/j.astropartphys.2014.06.007",
            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Ongoing and near-future imaging-based dark energy experiments are critically dependent upon photometric redshifts (a.k.a. photo-z's): i.e., estimates of the redshifts of objects based only on flux information obtained through broad filters. Higher-quality, lower-scatter photo-z's will result in smaller random errors on cosmological parameters; while systematic errors in photometric redshift estimates, if not constrained, may dominate all other uncertainties from these experiments. The desired optimization and calibration is dependent upon spectroscopic measurements for secure redshift information; this is the key application of galaxy spectroscopy for imaging-based dark energy experiments. Hence, to achieve their full potential, imaging-based experiments will require large sets of objects with spectroscopically-determined redshifts, for two purposes: \u2022 Training: Objects with known redshift are needed to map out the relationship between object color and z (or, equivalently, to determine empirically-calibrated templates describing the rest-frame spectra of the full range of galaxies, which may be used to predict the color-z relation). The ultimate goal of training is to minimize each moment of the distribution of differences between photometric redshift estimates and the true redshifts of objects, making the relationship between them as tight as possible. The larger and more complete our \"training set\" of spectroscopic redshifts is, the smaller the RMS photo-z errors should be, increasing the constraining power of imaging experiments. Requirements: Spectroscopic redshift measurements for \u223c30,000 objects over > \u223c15 widely-separated regions, each at least \u223c20 arcmin in diameter, and reaching the faintest objects used in a given experiment, will likely be necessary if photometric redshifts are to be trained and calibrated with conventional techniques. Larger, more complete samples (i.e., with longer exposure times) can improve photo-z algorithms and reduce scatter further, enhancing the science return from planned experiments greatly (increasing the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit by up to \u223c50%). Options: This spectroscopy will most efficiently be done by covering as much of the optical and near-infrared spectrum as possible at modestly high spectral resolution (\u03bb/\u0394\u03bb > \u223c3000), while maximizing the telescope collecting area, field of view on the sky, and multiplexing of simultaneous spectra. The most efficient instrument for this would likely be either the proposed GMACS/MANIFEST spectrograph for the Giant Magellan Telescope or the OPTIMOS spectrograph for the European Extremely Large Telescope, depending on actual properties when built. The PFS spectrograph at Subaru would be next best and available considerably earlier, c. 2018; the proposed ngCFHT and SSST telescopes would have similar capabilities but start later. Other key options, in order of increasing total time required, are the WFOS spectrograph at TMT, MOONS at the VLT, and DESI at the Mayall 4 m telescope (or the similar 4MOST and WEAVE projects); of these, only DESI, MOONS, and PFS are expected to be available before 2020. Table 2-3 of this white paper summarizes the observation time required at each facility for strawman training samples. To attain secure redshift measurements for a high fraction of targeted objects and cover the full redshift span of future experiments, additional near-infrared spectroscopy will also be required; this is best done from space, particularly with WFIRST-2.4 and JWST. Calibration: The first several moments of redshift distributions (the mean, RMS redshift dispersion, etc.), must be known to high accuracy for cosmological constraints not to be systematics-dominated (equivalently, the moments of the distribution of differences between photometric and true redshifts could be determined instead). The ultimate goal of calibration is to characterize these moments for every subsample used in analyses - i.e., to minimize the uncertainty in their mean redshift, RMS dispersion, etc. - rather than to make the moments themselves small. Calibration may be done with the same spectroscopic dataset used for training if that dataset is extremely high in redshift completeness (i.e., no populations of galaxies to be used in analyses are systematically missed). Accurate photo-z calibration is necessary for all imaging experiments. Requirements: If extremely low levels of systematic incompleteness (<\u223c0.1%) are attained in training samples, the same datasets described above should be sufficient for calibration. However, existing deep spectroscopic surveys have failed to yield secure redshifts for 30-60% of targets, so that would require very large improvements over past experience. This incompleteness would be a limiting factor for training, but catastrophic for calibration. If <\u223c0.1% incompleteness is not attainable, the best known option for calibration of photometric redshifts is to utilize cross-correlation statistics in some form. The most direct method for this uses cross-correlations between positions on the sky of bright objects of known spectroscopic redshift with the sample of objects that we wish to calibrate the redshift distribution for, measured as a function of spectroscopic z. For such a calibration, redshifts of \u223c100,000 objects over at least several hundred square degrees, spanning the full redshift range of the samples used for dark energy, would be necessary.Options: The proposed BAO experiment eBOSS would provide sufficient spectroscopy for basic calibrations, particularly for ongoing and near-future imaging experiments. The planned DESI experiment would provide excellent calibration with redundant cross-checks, but will start after the conclusion of some imaging projects. An extension of DESI to the Southern hemisphere would provide the best possible calibration from cross-correlation methods for DES and LSST. We thus anticipate that our two primary needs for spectroscopy - training and calibration of photometric redshifts - will require two separate solutions. For ongoing and future projects to reach their full potential, new spectroscopic samples of faint objects will be needed for training; those new samples may be suitable for calibration, but the latter possibility is uncertain. In contrast, wide-area samples of bright objects are poorly suited for training, but can provide high-precision calibrations via cross-correlation techniques. Additional training/calibration redshifts and/or host galaxy spectroscopy would enhance the use of supernovae and galaxy clusters for cosmology. We also summarize additional work on photometric redshift techniques that will be needed to prepare for data from ongoing and future dark energy experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and location of pelvic adhesions in women with a history of Cesarean section and to identify risk factors for their formation and symptoms associated with their presence. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of women in whom one or more Cesarean sections had been performed > 12 months previously and who attended for a gynecological ultrasound examination. In all women, both transvaginal and transabdominal scans were performed in order to identify the presence of pelvic adhesions. Medical and surgical history was recorded and a structured questionnaire was used to enquire about any history of pelvic pain and urinary symptoms. Results: A total of 308 women were recruited into the study. On ultrasound examination, 139 (45.1% (95% CI, 39.7-50.7%)) women showed evidence of adhesions within the pelvis. Adhesions in the vesicouterine pouch were the most common and were found in a total of 79 (25.6% (95% CI, 20.7-30.5%)) women. In women with a history of no surgery other than Cesarean section(s) ( n = 220), an increasing number of Cesarean sections (odds ratio (OR) 3.4 (95% CI, 2.1-5.5)) and a postoperative wound infection (OR 11.7 (95% CI, 3.5-39.5)) increased the likelihood of adhesions developing in the anterior pelvic compartment. There was a significant association between the presence of anterior compartment adhesions and chronic pelvic pain. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified anterior abdominal wall adhesions (OR 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0-5.9)) and any adhesions present on ultrasound scan (OR 2.6 (95% CI, 1.2-5.7)) as independent predictors of chronic pelvic pain. Conclusions: Pelvic adhesions are present in more than a third of women with a history of Cesarean section and they are associated with chronic pelvic pain.",

            "Abstract": "TAL-effector nucleases (TALENs) are attractive tools for sequence-specific genome modifications, but their delivery still remains problematic. It is well known that the presence of multiple sequence repeats in TALEN genes hampers the use of lentiviral vectors. We report that lentiviral vectors readily package full-length vector mRNAs encoding TALENs, but recombination during reverse transcription prevents successful delivery. We reasoned that preventing reverse transcription of lentiviral-vector RNA would allow transfer of TALENs as mRNA. We demonstrate that lentiviral particles containing genetically inactivated reverse transcriptase (RT) mediated efficient transduction of cultured cells and supported transient transgene expression. For proof-of-principle, we transferred CCR5-and TCR-specific TALEN pairs for efficient targeted genome editing and abrogated expression for each of the receptor proteins in different cell lines. Combining the high specificity of TALENs with efficient lentiviral gene delivery should advance genome editing in vitro and potentially in vivo, and RT-deficient lentiviral vectors may be useful for transient expression of various other genes-of-interest.",

Here, we report that brief exposure to dynamic substrate strain (sufficient to rapidly stimulate cell division) influences the orientation of osteoblastic cell division. The initial proliferative response to strain involves canonical Wnt signaling and can be blocked by sclerostin. However, the strain-related orientation of cell division is independently influenced through the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Blockade of Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK), a component of the PCP pathway, prevents strain-related orientation of division in osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells. Heterozygous loop-tail mutation of the core PCP component van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2) in mouse osteoblasts impairs the orientation of division in response to strain. Examination of bones from Vangl2 loop-tail heterozygous mice by mCT and scanning electron microscopy reveals altered bone architecture and disorganized bone-forming surfaces. Hence, in addition to the well-accepted role of PCP involvement in response to developmental cues during skeletal morphogenesis, our data reveal that this pathway also acts postnatally, in parallel with canonical Wnt signaling, to transduce biomechanical cues into skeletal adaptive responses. The simultaneous and independent actions of these two pathways appear to influence both the rate and orientation of osteoblast division, thus fine-tuning bone architecture to meet the structural demands of functional loading.",

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.Background The quality of the early environment is hypothesized to be an influence on morphological development in key neural areas related to affective responding, but direct evidence to support this possibility is limited. In a 22-year longitudinal study, we examined hippocampal and amygdala volumes in adulthood in relation to early infant attachment status, an important indicator of the quality of the early caregiving environment. Methods Participants (N = 59) were derived from a prospective longitudinal study of the impact of maternal postnatal depression on child development. Infant attachment status (24 Secure; 35 Insecure) was observed at 18 months of age, and MRI assessments were completed at 22 years. Results In line with hypotheses, insecure versus secure infant attachment status was associated with larger amygdala volumes in young adults, an effect that was not accounted for by maternal depression history. We did not find early infant attachment status to predict hippocampal volumes. Conclusions Common variations in the quality of early environment are associated with gross alterations in amygdala morphology in the adult brain. Further research is required to establish the neural changes that underpin the volumetric differences reported here, and any functional implications.",

Moreover, they are distinct from other biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in terms of molecular structure and metabolic purposes. Therefore processing methods should be carefully carried out in order to preserve vitamin content. These techniques, which mostly involve thermal processing or application of electric field or high hydrostatic pressures, have great influence on bioavailability and bioaccessibility of these vitamins and therefore should be efficiently optimized so as not to significantly alter these properties. Additionally, determination of these two critical properties plays a key role for further formulation of an efficient diet. However, factors such as age, gender, nutrient status, and health condition of individuals, such us genotype, pregnancy, lactation, or specific disorders, should be taken into account for the determination of bioavailability.",

The primary aim of the present study was to compare self and carer ratings of QoL in PwD and to identify the most important factors influencing self and carer ratings. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analytic study of 488 dyads using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease scale, demographics, data on self-rated health, and clinical characteristics. Results: Higher levels of self-rated health in PwD were associated with higher self-rated QoL after controlling for depression and activities of daily living. When the carer experienced less stress related to caregiving, the PwD reported better QoL. Higher carer-rated QoL was associated with less carer stress, better health for the family carer, and the PwD being of younger age. When carers lived with the PwD, and reported lower levels of depression and better functional ability for their relative, carer-rated QoL was higher. Conclusions: The self-rated health of PwD and carers influences the ratings they make of the QoL of the PwD indicating that it is an important influence on QoL in this population.",

However, when unexpected changes in the environment occur, we have the capacity to inhibit prepotent behavior and replace it with an alternative one. Such behavioral flexibility is a hallmark of executive functions. The neurotransmitter dopamine is known to be crucial for fast, efficient, and accurate cognitive flexibility. Despite the perceived similarities between cognitive and motor flexibility, less is known regarding the role of dopamine within the motor domain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of dopamine in motor flexibility. In a double-blind, five-session, within-subject pharmacological experiment, human participants performed an RT task within a probabilistic context that was either predictable or unpredictable. The probabilistic nature of the predictable context resulted in prediction errors. This required participants to replace the prepotent or prepared action with an unprepared action (motor flexibility). The task was overlearned, and changes in context were explicitly instructed, thus controlling for contributions from other dopamine-related processes such as probabilistic or reversal learning and interactions with other types of uncertainty. We found that dopamine receptor blockade by high-dose haloperidol (D1/D2 dopamine receptors) impaired participants\u2019 ability to react to unexpected events occurring in a predictable context, which elicit large prediction errors and necessitate motor flexibility. This effect was not observed with selective D2 receptor blockade (sulpiride), with a general increase in tonic dopamine levels (levodopa), or during an unpredictable context, which evoked minimal prediction error. We propose that dopamine is vital in responding to low-level prediction errors about stimulus outcome that requires motor flexibility.",

Journal of Flood Risk Management published by The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Interviews with 304 households were used to determine flood risk reduction measures adopted in the case study of the Becva River in the Czech Republic. Uptake of measures was low, irrespective of experience with floods. Financial cost seemed to be a barrier towards implementation, but more work is needed to understand the combination of factors limiting adoption of household flood risk reduction measures. Regression analysis indicated that socio-demographic factors play an important role in household decision making. More men and more children in a household support the adoption of measures. Perception of living in a flood risk zone, rather than actual experience of flooding, also positively influenced probability of adopting some measures. When a house is elevated up from ground level by 1 metre or more, the likelihood of taking further measures decreased by 20%. Further investigation of these factors and why, not just how, they influence household choices would support flood risk reduction measures, especially under a changing climate.",

The principal symbol of the operator is assumed to be trace-free and the subprincipal symbol is assumed to be zero. Given a positive scalar weight function, we study the weighted eigenvalue problem for the operator L. The corresponding counting function (number of eigenvalues between zero and a positive \u03bb) is known to admit, under appropriate assumptions on periodic trajectories, a two-term asymptotic expansion as \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e and we have recently derived an explicit formula for the second asymptotic coefficient. The purpose of this paper is to establish the geometric meaning of the second asymptotic coefficient. To this end, we identify the geometric objects encoded within our eigenvalue problem - metric, non-vanishing spinor field and topological charge - and express our asymptotic coefficients in terms of these geometric objects. We prove that the second asymptotic coefficient of the counting function has the geometric meaning of the massless Dirac action.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.We performed an interlaboratory comparison study with the aim to determine the accuracy of cosmogenic 21Ne measurements in quartz. CREU-1 is a natural quartz standard prepared from amalgamated vein clasts which were crushed, thoroughly mixed, and sieved into 125-250\u03bcm and 250-500\u03bcm size fractions. 50 aliquots of CREU-1 were analyzed by five laboratories employing six different noble gas mass spectrometers. The released gas contained a mixture of 16-30% atmospheric and 70-84% non-atmospheric (predominantly cosmogenic) 21Ne, defining a linear array on the 22Ne/20Ne-21Ne/20Ne three isotope diagram with a slope of 1.108\u00b10.014. The internal reproducibility of the measurements is in good agreement with the formal analytical precision for all participating labs. The external reproducibility of the 21Ne concentrations between labs, however, is significantly overdispersed with respect to the reported analytical precision. We report an average reference concentration for CREU-1 of 348\u00b110\u00d7106at [21Ne]/g[SiO2], and suggest that the 7.1% (2\u03c3) overdispersion of our measurements may be representative of the current accuracy of cosmogenic 21Ne in quartz. CREU-1 was tied to CRONUS-A, which is a second reference material prepared from a sample of Antarctic sandstone. We propose a reference value of 320\u00b111\u00d7106at/g for CRONUS-A. The CREU-1 and CRONUS-A intercalibration materials may be used to improve the consistency of cosmogenic 21Ne to the level of the analytical precision.",

The hypothesis is based on the accumulated genetics and genomic evidence linking X chromosome genes and transcripts to neuronal cells. The behavioral genetics literature has long pointed to the link between postsynaptic protein complexes coded on chromosome X and mental retardation. More recently, novel genomic evidence has emerged of X-linked mRNA overexpression of neuronal source in the human brain. We review the evidence for this hypothesis and its consistency with the distribution across genders of brain disorders of known aetiology. We then provide examples of the utilization of this hypothesis in the investigation of the pathophysiology of complex brain disorders in both the stratification of disease cohorts and the development of realistic preclinical models. We conclude by providing a general framework for testing its validity, which will be exploited in future studies, and provide future directions for research.",

            "Abstract": "The secondary products revolution is re-appraised here as a critical process in human history that created durable and enduring relationships between people and their livestock. The secondary products revolution is conventionally described in terms of agricultural intensification and a step towards urban development. This process marks a shift from a strategy in which most animals are culled when they reach an optimal weight, which for ruminants occurs relatively early in life, to one in which individual animals are selected for their potential to yield one or more renewable products over the course of life and raised until they can no longer produce secondary products, which tends to occur in adulthood. This new mode of practice placed individual members of two species on an intersubjective ontological plane and moreover, spelled a shift in the temporality of human\u2013livestock relations. This paper draws out the consequences of these ever-closer relationships in the course of human efforts to exploit renewable resources from domesticated animals. In particular, secondary products exploitation extended the lives of lactating female stock, sheep and goats desired for their fibres, oxen engaged in ploughing and donkeys working as pack animals. In this paper, the implications of these new long-term human\u2013animal relationships, which originated and intensified sporadically in different regions of the Near East starting as early as the Neolithic, are discussed in light of the new temporality that attended practices of long-term stock-keeping. This model is examined in light of zooarchaeological, micromorphological and representational evidence for human\u2013livestock relations from the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age of the southern Levant. \u00a9 2015, SAGE Publication.

After injection of hyperpolarized [13C]urea, a spin echo sequence was used to measure urea concentration, T1, and diffusion in control and UTB-expressing tissue. Results The apparent diffusion coefficient of hyperpolarized urea was 21% lower in tissue expressing UTB, in comparison with control tissue (P<0.05, 1-tailed t-test, n=6 in each group). No difference in water apparent diffusion coefficient or cellularity between these tissues was found, indicating that they were otherwise similar in composition. Conclusion Expression of UTB, by mediating cell uptake of urea, lowers the apparent diffusion coefficient of hyperpolarized 13C urea in tissue and thus the transporter has the potential to be used as a magnetic resonance-based gene reporter in vivo.",

Despite the fact that Borges (1899\u20131986) assigned his reading of The Divine Comedy to a rather late period in his life, this study argues that he was acquainted with the work of the Italian poet (or at least part of it) at a much earlier date\u2014as can be perceived in the poem \u2018Llamarada\u2019, published in 1920. It also shows that Borges\u2019s intention in dealing with Dante was not in itself parodical. On the contrary, it reveals his concern about the human condition and the ways in which literature can manifest man\u2019s being in the world.",

This paper examines use of the term in the context of health-related behaviour, and explores how the concept might be made more useful. A narrative review is presented, drawing on a scoping review of 136 empirical studies and 8 literature reviews undertaken to document usage of the term \u2018habit\u2019, and methods to measure it. A coherent definition of \u2018habit\u2019, and proposals for improved methods for studying it, were derived from findings. Definitions of \u2018habit\u2019 have varied in ways that are often implicit and not coherently linked with an underlying theory. A definition is proposed whereby habit is a process by which a stimulus generates an impulse to act as a result of a learned stimulus-response association. Habit-generated impulses may compete or combine with impulses and inhibitions arising from other sources, including conscious decision-making, to influence responses, and need not generate behaviour. Most research on habit is based on correlational studies using self-report measures. Adopting a coherent definition of \u2018habit\u2019, and a wider range of paradigms, designs and measures to study it, may accelerate progress in habit theory and application.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Long-term deprivation of normal visual inputs can cause perceptual impairments at various levels of visual function, from basic visual acuity deficits, through mid-level deficits such as contour integration and motion coherence, to high-level face and object agnosia. Yet it is unclear whether training during adulthood, at a post-developmental stage of the adult visual system, can overcome such developmental impairments. Here, we visually trained LG, a developmental object and face agnosic individual. Prior to training, at the age of 20, LG's basic and mid-level visual functions such as visual acuity, crowding effects, and contour integration were underdeveloped relative to normal adult vision, corresponding to or poorer than those of 5-6 year olds (Gilaie-Dotan, Perry, Bonneh, Malach & Bentin, 2009). Intensive visual training, based on lateral interactions, was applied for a period of 9 months. LG's directly trained but also untrained visual functions such as visual acuity, crowding, binocular stereopsis and also mid-level contour integration improved significantly and reached near-age-level performance, with long-term (over 4 years) persistence. Moreover, mid-level functions that were tested post-training were found to be normal in LG. Some possible subtle improvement was observed in LG's higher-order visual functions such as object recognition and part integration, while LG's face perception skills have not improved thus far. These results suggest that corrective training at a post-developmental stage, even in the adult visual system, can prove effective, and its enduring effects are the basis for a revival of a developmental cascade that can lead to reduced perceptual impairments.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Sense of agency refers to the feeling of controlling an external event through one\u2019s own action. On one influential view, sense of agency is inferred after an action, by \u201cretrospectively\u201d comparing actual effects of actions against their intended effects. However, it has been recently shown that earlier processes, linked to action selection, may also contribute to sense of agency, in advance of the action itself, and independently of action effects. The inferior parietal cortex (IPC) may underpin this \u201cprospective\u201d contribution to agency, by monitoring signals relating to fluency of action selection in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we combined transcranial stimulation (TMS) with subliminal priming of action selection to investigate the causal role of these regions in the prospective coding of agency. In a first experiment, we showed that TMS over left IPC at the time of action selection disrupts perceived control over subsequent effects of action. In a second experiment, we exploited the temporal specificity of single-pulse TMS to pinpoint the exact timing of IPC contribution to sense of agency. We replicated the reduction in perceived control at the point of action selection, while observing no effect of TMS-induced disruption of IPC at the time of action outcomes.",

Recent events have revealed profound uncertainty at the heart of financial markets, the manifest existence of emotion and the way confidence is crucial to orderly market functioning. Using findings from two interview studies, supported by ethnographic observation, we elaborate on the irreducible cognitive and emotional conflicts which face actors engaged in financial markets and threaten their daily operations. We introduce the term conviction narrative to analyse how they manage these conflicts on a day-to-day basis, and with what collective consequences. Our thesis is that expertise and conviction in financial markets have constantly to be created and renewed through a combination of psychological and social action with the implication at the macro level that while financial markets can be orderly they are so in an intrinsically fragile way.",

Area published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).How do you design a sustainable urban area from scratch? A growing number of urban development projects, marketing themselves as sustainable or 'eco' cities, claim to have the answer. This paper focuses on the companies who create the masterplans that guide the development of such sustainable urban projects. While these projects are appearing in a diverse array of locations around the world, they are largely conceived and designed by a small, elite group of international architecture, engineering and planning firms based in North America and Europe sometimes referred to as the global intelligence corps (GIC). Drawing on research into these firms, the paper examines the contemporary drivers of internationalisation in sustainable urban planning and design. These include enhanced professional reputations and satisfaction for designers and branding benefits for clients with a desire to be seen as modern and 'global'. The paper then considers the role of international masterplanners in the global dissemination of ideas in this area, concluding that the GIC and the plans they develop are playing a significant role in the development of an international model of sustainable urbanism. However, the way in which this model is actually expressed in material form is strongly influenced by the demands and priorities of the GIC's international clients. The paper concludes by reflecting on what this research demonstrates about what it means for a planning model to be both relational and territorial.",

We have piloted a new, low intensity (LI) CBT intervention specifically designed to be delivered by frontline mental health staff, following brief training, and with ongoing supervision and support. A pilot feasibility study has demonstrated significant improvement in service user outcomes. This study is a qualitative analysis of the experiences of the staff and service users taking part in the evaluation. Aims: To evaluate the acceptability of the training protocol and the therapy, and to examine the factors promoting and restraining implementation. Method: All trained staff and service users completed a semi-structured interview that was transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Service users spoke about learning new skills and achieving their goals. Staff spoke about being able to use a brief, structured intervention to achieve positive outcomes for their clients. Both groups felt that longer, more sophisticated interventions were required to address more complex problems. The positive clinical outcomes motivated therapists to continue using the approach, despite organizational barriers. Conclusions: For both trained staff and service users, taking part in the study was a positive experience. Staff members' perceived skill development and positive reaction to seeing their clients improve should help to promote implementation. Work is needed to clarify whether and how more complex difficulties should be addressed by frontline staff.",

In an experimental test of the theory, we systematically change the shape of revealed utility, weighting, and discounting functions by manipulating the distribution of monies, probabilities, and delays in the choices used to elicit them. The data demonstrate that there is no stable mapping between attribute values and their subjective equivalents. Expected and discounted utility theories, and also their descendants such as prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting theory, simply assert stable mappings to describe choice data and offer no account of the instability we find.

Organized by the respiratory representatives of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Federations (EFPIA) group of companies involved in the EU-funded project (U-BIOPRED), the aim of the symposium was to identify state-of-the-art improvements in the utility and design of models of respiratory disease, with a view to improving their translational potential and reducing wasteful animal usage. The respiratory research and development community is responding to the challenge of improving translation in several ways: greater collaboration and open sharing of data, careful selection of the species, complexity and chronicity of the models, improved practices in preclinical research, continued refinement in models of respiratory diseases and their sub-types, greater understanding of the biology underlying human respiratory diseases and their sub-types, and finally greater use of human (and especially disease-relevant) cells, tissues and explants. The present review highlights these initiatives, combining lessons from the symposium and papers published in Clinical Science arising from the symposium, with critiques of the models currently used in the settings of asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. The ultimate hope is that this will contribute to a more rational, efficient and sustainable development of a range of new treatments for respiratory diseases that continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality across the world. \u00a9 The Authors Journal compilation.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s), 2014.Background: In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelination and neuro-axonal loss occur in the brain grey matter (GM). We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of GM magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) and volume to assess the regional localisation of reduced MTR (reflecting demyelination) and atrophy (reflecting neuro-axonal loss) in relapsingremitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Methods: A total of 98 people with MS (51 RRMS, 28 SPMS, 19 PPMS) and 29 controls had T1-weighted volumetric and magnetisation transfer scans. SPM8 was used to undertake voxel-based analysis (VBA) of GM tissue volumes and MTR. MS subgroups were compared with controls, adjusting for age and gender. A voxel-by-voxel basis correlation analysis between MTR and volume within each subject group was performed, using biological parametric mapping. Results: MTR reduction was more extensive than atrophy. RRMS and SPMS patients showed proportionately more atrophy in the deep GM. SPMS and PPMS patients showed proportionately greater cortical MTR reduction. RRMS patients demonstrated the most correlation of MTR reduction and atrophy in deep GM. In SPMS and PPMS patients, there was less extensive correlation. Conclusions: These results suggest that in the deep GM of RRMS patients, demyelination and neuroaxonal loss may be linked, while in SPMS and PPMS patients, neuro-axonal loss and demyelination may occur mostly independently.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors. Arthritis & Rheumatology is published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Objective The excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, including type I collagen, is a key aspect in the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). To further our understanding of the mechanisms governing the dysregulation of type I collagen production in SSc, we investigated the role of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors in regulating COL1A2 transcription.Methods The expression and nuclear localization of AP-1 family members (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Fra-1, Fra-2, and c-Fos) were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in dermal biopsy specimens and explanted skin fibroblasts from patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc and healthy controls. Gene activation was determined by assessing the interaction of transcription factors with the COL1A2 enhancer using transient transfection of reporter gene constructs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, and RNA interference involving knockdown of individual AP-1 family members. Inhibition of fibroblast mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) signaling pathways was achieved using small-molecule pharmacologic inhibitors.Results Binding of JunB to the COL1A2 enhancer was observed, with its coalescence directed by activation of gene transcription through the proximal promoter. Knockdown of JunB reduced enhancer activation and COL1A2 expression in response to transforming growth factor \u03b2. In SSc dermal fibroblasts, increased mTOR/Akt signaling was associated with inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2, leading to blockade of JunB degradation and, thus, constitutively high expression of JunB.Conclusion In patients with SSc, the accumulation of JunB resulting from altered mTOR/Akt signaling and a failure of proteolytic degradation underpins the aberrant overexpression of type I collagen. These findings identify JunB as a potential target for antifibrotic therapy in SSc.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of the hemoglobin- based nitric oxide scavenger, pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene, against placebo in patients with vasopressordependent distributive shock. Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label study. Setting: Sixty-one participating ICUs in six European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom). Patients: All patients admitted with distributive shock, defined as the presence of at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, persisting norepinephrine dependence and evidence of organ dysfunction/hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive 0.25 mL/kg/hr pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene (20 mg Hb/kg/hr) or an equal volume of placebo, infused for up to 150 hours, in addition to conventional vasopressor therapy. Measurements and Main Results: The study was stopped after interim analysis showed higher mortality in the pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene group and an increased prevalence of adverse events. At this time, 377 patients had been randomized to pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene (n = 183) or placebo (n = 194). Age, gender, type of patient (medical/surgical), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were similar between groups. Twenty-eight-day mortality rate was 44.3% in the pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene group versus 37.6% in the placebo group (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.85-1.95; p = 0.227). In patients with higher organ dysfunction scores (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment > 13), mortality rates were significantly higher in the pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene group when compared with those in placebo-treated patients (60.9% vs 39.2%; p = 0.014). Survivors who received pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene had a longer vasopressor-free time (21.3 vs 19.7 d; p = 0.035). Conclusions: In this randomized, controlled phase III trial in patients with vasopressor-dependent distributive shock, administration of a pyridoxalated hemoglobin solution decreased the need for vasopressors but was associated with a trend to increased mortality.",

All rights reserved.Global warming and rising sea levels are increasingly causing major problems for low lying Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations. The Republic of Kiribati in the South Pacific is currently in a dire situation, and increasing levels of international aid will be required to maintain the population at its current standard of living. This paper describes a sustainable artificial island, designed for the inhabitants of South Tarawa, the capital island of the Republic of Kiribati. Design targets were to improve infrastructure, services and quality of life for the inhabitants, to increase island sustainability and to minimise construction costs. Transition to an artificial island is a feasible option with significant international support, and would enable survival for the population of South Tarawa with minimum disruption to their current lifestyle. Its construction and population would require a large leap of faith by both the financiers and the inhabitants, but it has the potential to provide a range of economic, social and environmental benefits both for the population and for the country.",

Two modelling strategies were applied\u2014failure mechanisms analysis by means of macro element methodology (MEM) and non-linear response analysis by means of structural element modelling. The accuracy in predicting failure modes by MEM ranged between 50 and 80 % of the stock of building in rural area. The most critical failure mechanisms were due to out-of-plane loading. Given the uncertainties associated with the data relative to the urban architecture stock, the MEM analysis was carried out considering different hypotheses, leading to a range of 30\u201370 % damaged buildings, for 475 years return period, with diverse failure mechanisms and ultimate capacity depending on specific structural assumptions. For one building of rural architecture already damaged during previous earthquake in 2004, where due to the extensive in-situ campaign the influence of uncertainties were minimised, direct comparison of the effectiveness of both methods were investigated. MEM assessment yields more conservative results in respect to non-linear approach and thus may be an efficient tool for the design of strengthening measures for heritage buildings to prevent damage in lower intensity events with higher probability of occurrence.",

Although this proposal found some support, it also attracted strong criticisms as it risks raising the spreads for strong countries, diluting legacy debt and promoting moral hazard by weak countries. Because Eurobonds are a new addition to the policy toolkit, there are many untested hypotheses in the literature about the counterfactual behaviour of markets and sovereigns. This paper offers some tests of the issues by drawing from the closest historical parallel - five guaranteed bonds issued in Europe between 1833 and 1913. The empirical evidence suggests that contemporary concerns about fiscal transfers and debt dilution may be overblown, and creditors' moral hazard may be as much of a problem as debtors'.",

We argue that in a post-conflict country, ethnic pluralism is indicative of local norms of tolerance towards experimentation and risk taking which support growth aspirations.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC\u00aeAbstract: Background Pain is a common and highly debilitating complication for cancer patients significantly compromising their quality of life. Cancer-induced bone pain involves a complex interplay of multiple mechanisms including both inflammatory and neuropathic processes and also some unique changes. Strong opioids are a mainstay of treatments but side effects are problematic and can compromise optimal pain control. Tapentadol is a novel dual-action drug, both stimulating inhibitory \u03bc-opioid receptors (MOR) and mediating noradrenaline reuptake inhibition (NRI) leading to activation of the inhibitory \u03b1-2 adrenoceptor. It has been demonstrated to treat effectively both acute and chronic pain. We here demonstrate the efficacy in a model of cancer-induced bone pain. Methods MRMT-1 mammary carcinoma cells were inoculated into the tibia of 6-week-old rats and 2 weeks after, the neuronal responses to a wide range of peripheral stimulation were evaluated. The recordings were made from wide-dynamic range neurons in lamina V of the dorsal horn before and after administration of tapentadol as well as antagonists of the two mechanisms, naloxone or atipamezole. Results We found marked inhibitions of the neuronal activity with efficacy against mechanical, thermal and electrically evoked activity following tapentadol administration. In addition, the effects of the drug were fully reversible by naloxone and partly by atipamezole, supporting the idea of MOR-NRI dual actions. Conclusions These findings add to the mechanistic understanding of cancer-induced bone pain and support the sparse clinical data indicating a possible use of the drug as a therapeutic alternative for cancer patients with metastatic pain complication.",

METHODS: We randomly assigned 197 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 0 to receive RIC (four 5-min cycles of upper arm cuff inflation/deflation) or control (uninflated cuff placed on upper arm for 40 min) protocols prior to PPCI. The primary study endpoint was MI size, measured by CMR in 83 subjects on days 3 to 6 after admission. RESULTS: RIC reduced MI size by 27%, when compared with the MI size of control subjects (18.0 \u00b1 10% [n = 40] vs. 24.5 \u00b1 12.0% [n = 43]; p = 0.009). At 24 h, high-sensitivity troponin T was lower with RIC (2,296 \u00b1 263 ng/l [n = 89] vs. 2,736 \u00b1 325 ng/l [n = 84]; p = 0.037). RIC also reduced the extent of myocardial edema measured by T2-mapping CMR (28.5 \u00b1 9.0% vs. 35.1 \u00b1 10.0%; p = 0.003) and lowered mean T2 values (68.7 \u00b1 5.8 ms vs. 73.1 \u00b1 6.1 ms; p = 0.001), precluding the use of CMR edema imaging to correctly estimate the area at risk. Using CMR-independent coronary angiography jeopardy scores to estimate the area at risk, RIC, when compared with the control protocol, was found to significantly improve the myocardial salvage index (0.42 \u00b1 0.29 vs. 0.28 \u00b1 0.29; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized study demonstrated that in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients treated by PPCI, RIC, initiated prior to PPCI, reduced MI size, increased myocardial salvage, and reduced myocardial edema.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.Before the use of rituximab, the strongest accepted evidence for an association between B-cells and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was that clinical disease was associated with serum autoantibodies. The ability to remove B-cells with rituximab has also revealed the relative importance of the different immunological parameters that underlie the clinical symptoms of RA. First, seropositive patients have a significantly more predictable and favorable clinical response to rituximab than seronegative patients. Second, the kinetics of the clinical response, with a delay of weeks or months after depletion, suggest that it is a B-cell product (autoantibody) and not B-cells per se that need to be reduced for remission to occur. Third, removal of B-cells from joints may not be closely associated with clinical improvement, although maintenance of plasma cell counts in joints has been associated with poorer responses. The requirement of \u2018new\u2019 B-cells generated from the bone marrow for relapse to occur suggests that selection of autoreactive B-cell clones in the periphery may also be necessary for their survival and differentiation into autoantibody-producing cells. The initial hypothesis suggested that the autoimmune response underlying the pathogenesis of RA was self-sustaining. This would seem to be confirmed, as relapse inevitably follows a variable period of reduced clinical symptoms induced by rituximab. In addition, a dominant role for autoantibodies seems to have strong support from clinical practice. In addition to their possible role in the pathogenesis of RA in the form of immune complexes, further investigation is necessary to determine whether autoantibodies contribute to perpetuation of changes in central B-cell tolerance in these patients.",

The combination of both ground- and space-based observations at Earth has enabled considerable progress to be made in understanding the terrestrial cusp and its role in the coupling of the magnetosphere to the solar wind via the polar magnetosphere. Voyager 2 fully explored Neptune's cusp in 1989, but highly inclined orbits of the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn present the most recent opportunity to repeatedly study the polar magnetosphere of a rapidly rotating planet. In this paper we discuss observations made by Cassini during two passes through Saturn's southern polar magnetosphere. Our main findings are that (i) Cassini directly encounters the southern polar cusp with evidence for the entry of magnetosheath plasma into the cusp via magnetopause reconnection, (ii) magnetopause reconnection and entry of plasma into the cusp can occur over a range of solar wind conditions, and (iii) double cusp morphologies are consistent with the position of the cusp oscillating in phase with Saturn's global magnetospheric periodicities.",

            "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The steep decline in physical activity (PA) among the oldest old is not well understood; there is little information about the patterns of change in PA and sedentary behaviour (SB) in older people. Longitudinal data on objectively measured PA data can give insights about how PA and SB change with age. METHODS: Men age 70-90 yr, from a United Kingdom population-based cohort wore a GT3X accelerometer over the hip annually on up to three occasions (56%, 50%, and 51% response rates) spanning 2 yr. Multilevel models were used to estimate change in activity. Men were grouped according to achieving \u2265150 min\u00b7wk of MVPA in bouts of \u226510 min (current guidelines) at two or three time points. RESULTS: A total of 1419 ambulatory men had \u2265600 min wear time on \u22653 d at \u22652 time points. At baseline, men took 4806 steps per day and spent 72.5% of their day in SB, 23.1% in light PA, and 4.1% in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Mean change per year was -341 steps, +1.1% SB, -0.7% light PA, and -0.4% MVPA each day (all P < 0.001). A total of 76.3% (n = 1083) never met guidelines (\"stable low\"), 7.9% (n = 112) consistently met guidelines (\"stable high\"), 8.2% (n = 116) stopped meeting guidelines by the last occasion (\"decreasers\"), and 4.9% (n = 69) started meeting guidelines by the last occasion (\"increasers\"). \"Decreasers\" spent 69.3% of each day in SB at baseline, which increased by 2% per year (P < 0.005), light activity remained at 23.3% (change, -0.2% per year; P = 0.4), and total MVPA decreased from 7.1% by -1.7% per year, (P < 0.001). The number of sedentary bouts >30 min increased from 5.1 by 0.1 per year (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, the steep decline in total PA occurred because of reductions in MVPA, while light PA is relatively spared and sedentary time and long sedentary bouts increase.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, \u00a9 2014 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.Background: A recent review of interaction (or conversation)-focused therapy highlighted the potential of programmes targeting the person with aphasia (PWA) directly. However, it noted the key limitations of current work in this field to be a reliance on single case analyses and qualitative evidence of change, a situation that is not unusual when a complex behavioural intervention is in the early stages of development and evaluation.Aims: This article aims to evaluate an intervention that targeted a PWA and their conversation partner (CP), a dyad, as equals in a novel conversation therapy for agrammatic aphasia, using both quantitative and qualitative evidence of change. The intervention aimed to increase the insight of a dyad into facilitator and barrier conversation behaviours, to increase the understanding of the effect of agrammatism on communication, and to support each speaker to choose three strategies to work on in therapy to increase mutual understanding and enhance conversation.Methods & Procedures: Quantitative and qualitative methods are used to analyse multiple pre-therapy and follow up assessments of conversation for two dyads.Outcomes & Results: Results show that one person with severe and chronic agrammatic aphasia was able to select and practise strategies that led to qualitative and quantitative changes in his post-therapy conversations. The other PWA showed a numerical increase in one of his three strategies post therapy, but no significant quantitative change. Although both CPs significantly reduced barrier behaviours in their post-therapy conversations, neither showed a significant increase in the strategies they chose to work on. For one CP, there was qualitative evidence of the use of different turn types.Conclusions: Individually tailored input from a speech and language therapist can assist some people with chronic agrammatism to develop conversational strategies that enhance communication. Outcomes are influenced by the severity and extent of language deficits affecting, for example, single word writing. In terms of behaviour change for CPs, it appears that it may be easier to reduce barrier behaviours rather than to increase the use of facilitatory strategies. The results have implications for collaborative goal setting with clients undergoing conversation therapy.",

We show how effective linear opticslike operations between arbitrary lattice sites can be implemented by a minimal local control which introduces a local impurity in the middle of the lattice. In particular we show how striking is the difference of the two possible correlations with and without the impurity. Our scheme enables the observation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect between distant wells without moving them next to each other with, e.g., tweezers.

The low energy recoiling protons were measured in a pair of silicon tracking telescopes placed on either side of the target. Putting a cut of 3 MeV on the diproton excitation energy ensured that the two protons were dominantly in the S01 state, here denoted by {pp}s. The polarisation of the deuterium gas was established through measurements in parallel of proton-deuteron elastic scattering. By analysing events where both protons entered the same telescope, the charge-exchange reaction was measured for momentum transfers q\u2265160MeV/c. These data provide a good continuation of the earlier results at q\u2264140MeV/c obtained with a polarised deuteron beam. They are also consistent with impulse approximation predictions with little sign evident for any modifications due to multiple scatterings.

We aim to maximize the harvested energy by the ERs while maintaining the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) threshold at the IR and keeping the message secure from possible eavesdropping by the ERs by suppressing their SINRs. Both scenarios of perfect and imperfect channel state information at the transmitter are studied. Using semidefinite relaxation techniques, we show that there always exists a rank-one optimal solution for the IR, i.e., transmit beamforming is optimal for the IR.",

It is characterized by progressive and relatively selective impairment of semantic memory, associated with asymmetric antero-inferior temporal lobe atrophy. Although the syndrome became widely recognized only in the 1980s, descriptions of cases with typical features of semantic dementia have been on record for over a century. Here, we draw attention to a well documented historical case of a patient with features that would have fulfilled current consensus criteria for semantic dementia, as reconstructed from the notes made by her neurologist, Macdonald Critchley, in 1938. This case raises a number of issues concerning the nosology of the semantic dementia syndrome and the potential value of archived case material.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.Gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptors (GABABRs) are heterodimeric G-protein coupled receptors, which mediate slow synaptic inhibition in the brain. Emerging evidence suggests astrocytes also express GABABRs, although their physiological significance remains unknown. To begin addressing this issue, we have used imaging and biochemical analysis to examine the role GABABRs play in regulating astrocytic Ca2+ signalling. Using live imaging of cultured cortical astrocytes loaded with calcium indicator Fluo-4/AM, we found that astrocytic GABABRs are able to induce astrocytic calcium transients only if they are pre-activated by P2 purinoceptors (P2YRs). The GABABR-mediated calcium transients were attenuated by the removal of extracellular calcium. Furthermore, P2YRs enhance the phosphorylation of astrocytic GABABR R2 subunits on both serine 783 (S783) and serine 892 (S892), two phosphorylation sites that are well known to regulate the activity and the cell surface stability of GABABRs. Collectively these results suggest that P2YR mediated signalling is an important determinant of GABABR activity and phosphorylation in astrocytes.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The European Society of Cardiology 2014.AIMS: To examine the association between cumulative missed opportunities for care (CMOC) and mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).METHODS: A cohort study of 112,286 STEMI patients discharged from hospital alive between January 2007 and December 2010, using data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP). A CMOC score was calculated for each patient and included: pre-hospital ECG, acute use of aspirin, timely reperfusion, prescription at hospital discharge of aspirin, thienopyridine inhibitor, ACE-inhibitor (or equivalent), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker, and referral for cardiac rehabilitation. Mixed-effects logistic regression models evaluated the effect of CMOC on risk-adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality (RAMR).RESULTS: 44.5% of patients were ineligible for \u22651 care component. Of patients eligible for all nine components, 50.6% missed \u22651 opportunity. Pre-hospital ECG and timely reperfusion were most frequently missed, predicting further missed care at discharge (pre-hospital ECG incident rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.64 [1.58-1.70]; timely reperfusion 9.94 [9.51-10.40]). Patients ineligible for care had higher RAMR than those eligible for care (30-days: 1.7% vs. 1.1%; 1-year: 8.6% vs. 5.2%), whilst those with no missed care had lower mortality than patients with \u22654 CMOC (30-days: 0.5% vs. 5.4%, adjusted OR (aOR) per CMOC group 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.42; 1-year: 3.2% vs. 22.8%, aOR 1.23, 1.13-1.34).CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities for care in STEMI are commonly missed and significantly associated with early and later mortality. Thus, outcomes after STEMI may be improved by greater attention to missed opportunities to eligible care.",

Recently, we proposed a generic model based on active (Bayesian) inference wherein dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about optimal policies. Put simply, dopamine discharges reflect the confidence that a chosen policy will lead to desired outcomes. We designed a novel task to test this hypothesis, where subjects played a \"limited offer\" game in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Subjects had to decide how long to wait for a high offer before accepting a low offer, with the risk of losing everything if they waited too long. Bayesian model comparison showed that behavior strongly supported active inference, based on surprise minimization, over classical utility maximization schemes. Furthermore, midbrain activity, encompassing dopamine projection neurons, was accurately predicted by trial-by-trial variations in model-based estimates of precision. Our findings demonstrate that human subjects infer both optimal policies and the precision of those inferences, and thus support the notion that humans perform hierarchical probabilistic Bayesian inference. In other words, subjects have to infer both what they should do as well as how confident they are in their choices, where confidence may be encoded by dopaminergic firing.",

            "Abstract": "CoA (coenzyme A) is a ubiquitous and essential cofactor that acts as an acyl group carrier in biochemical reactions. Apart from participating in numerous metabolic pathways as substrates and intermediates, CoA and a number of its thioester derivatives, such as acetyl-CoA, can also directly regulate the activity of proteins by allosteric mechanisms and by affecting protein acetylation reactions. Cellular levels of CoA and CoA thioesters change under various physiological and pathological conditions. Defective CoA biosynthesis is implicated in NBIA (neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation). However, the exact role of CoA in the pathogenesis of NBIA is not well understood. Accurate and reliable assays for measuring CoA species in biological samples are essential for studying the roles of CoA and CoA derivatives in health and disease. The present mini-review discusses methods that are commonly used to measure CoA species in biological samples. \u00a9 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2014 Biochemical Society.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to validate self-reported diabetes and age at diagnosis among a sample of the British population, using general practitioners (GPs) as the reference standard. Using data from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), self-reported diabetes was determined either in response to a direct question at five follow-ups between 1977 and 2010, or from other self-reported medical information. A validation questionnaire was sent to the GP for all participants who reported a diagnosis of diabetes and gave permission to contact their GP (172). The validity of self-reported diabetes was assessed by calculating the percentage of self-reported diabetes cases that were confirmed by their GP, i.e. the positive predictive value (PPV). The difference between self-reported and GP-confirmed age at diagnosis was analysed with a Bland-Altman plot. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 157 GPs (91.2%). Of these, 149 confirmed their patient self-reported diabetes diagnosis (PPV = 94.9%). Results were similar when self-reported diabetes was assessed by responses to direct questions only (PPV = 95.4%). The average difference between self-reported and GP-reported age at diagnosis was 0.6 years (95% CI 0.2-1.1). We conclude that among the British population questionnaires are a valid method to assess GP-diagnosed diabetes, as measured by responses to a direct question or by patient-reported medical information.",

The time series models proposed are used to summarize large multivariate data sets and to infer important physical parameters of inertial oscillations and other ocean processes. Non-stationary time series methods are employed to account for the spatiotemporal variability of each trajectory. Because the data sets are large, we construct computationally efficient methods through the use of frequency domain modelling and estimation, with the data expressed as complex-valued time series. We detail how practical issues related to sampling and model misspecification may be addressed by using semiparametric techniques for time series, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our stochastic models through application to both real world data and to numerical model output.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 IEEE.Many established classifiers fail to identify the minority class when it is much smaller than the majority class. To tackle this problem, researchers often first rebalance the class sizes in the training dataset, through oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class, and then use the rebalanced data to train the classifiers. This leads to interesting empirical patterns. In particular, using the rebalanced training data can often improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the original, unbalanced test data. The AUC is a widely-used quantitative measure of classification performance, but the property that it increases with rebalancing has, as yet, no theoretical explanation. In this note, using Gaussian-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as the classifier, we demonstrate that, at least for LDA, there is an intrinsic, positive relationship between the rebalancing of class sizes and the improvement of AUC. We show that the largest improvement of AUC is achieved, asymptotically, when the two classes are fully rebalanced to be of equal sizes.",

The design is to keep the message secret to the ERs while maximizing the information rate at the IR and meeting the energy harvesting constraints at the ERs. Technically, our objective is to optimize the information-bearing beam and artificial noise energy beam for maximizing the secrecy rate of the IR subject to individual harvested energy constraints of the ERs for the case where the ERs can collude to perform joint decoding in an attempt to illicitly decode the secret message to the IR. As a by-product, we also solve the total power minimization problem subject to secrecy rate and energy harvesting constraints. Both scenarios of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter are addressed. For the imperfect CSI case, we study both eavesdroppers' channel covariance-based and worst case-based designs. Using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques, we show that there always exists a rank-one optimal transmit covariance solution for the IR. Furthermore, if the SDR results in a higher rank solution, we propose an efficient algorithm to always construct an equivalent rank-one optimal solution. Computer simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Humans express laughter differently depending on the context: polite titters of agreement are very different from explosions of mirth. Using functional MRI, we explored the neural responses during passive listening to authentic amusement laughter and controlled, voluntary laughter. We found greater activity in anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) to the deliberate, Emitted Laughs, suggesting an obligatory attempt to determine others' mental states when laughter is perceived as less genuine. In contrast, passive perception of authentic Evoked Laughs was associated with greater activity in bilateral superior temporal gyri. An individual differences analysis found that greater accuracy on a post hoc test of authenticity judgments of laughter predicted the magnitude of passive listening responses to laughter in amPFC, as well as several regions in sensorimotor cortex (in line with simulation accounts of emotion perception). These medial prefrontal and sensorimotor sites showed enhanced positive connectivity with cortical and subcortical regions during listening to involuntary laughter, indicating a complex set of interacting systems supporting the automatic emotional evaluation of heard vocalizations.",

Although 0-30 hexanucleotide repeats are present in the general population, expansions >500 repeats are associated with C9ALS/FTD. Large C9ALS/FTD expansions share a common haplotype and whether these expansions derive from a single founder or occur more frequently on a predisposing haplotype is yet to be determined and is relevant to disease pathomechanisms. Furthermore, although cases carrying 50-200 repeats have been described, their role and the pathogenic threshold of the expansions remain to be identified and carry importance for diagnostics and genetic counseling. We present clinical and genetic data from a UK ALS cohort and report the detailed molecular study of an atypical somatically unstable expansion of 90 repeats. Our results across different tissues provide evidence for the pathogenicity of this repeat number by showing they can somatically expand in the central nervous system to the well characterized pathogenic range. Our results support the occurrence of multiple expansion events for C9ALS/FTD.",

The aim of the present study was to examine prospectively the associations between telomere shortening (TS) and both the progression of atherosclerosis and the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVEs). Materials and methods: Leucocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the ratio of telomere length to single-copy gene (T/S) in 768 subjects (462 female and 306 male) enrolled in a large general population survey [the Progressione della Lesione Intimale Carotidea (PLIC study)]. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness was determined at baseline and after 6 years of follow-up, and the associations between TS and the progression of atherosclerosis and incidence of CVEs were evaluated. Results: Mean LTL was 1.25 \u00b1 0.92 T/S (median 1.14) at baseline and 0.70 \u00b1 0.37 T/S (median 0.70) after 6 years of follow-up. Median 6-year LTL change was -0.46 T/S [interquartile range (IQR) -0.57 to 1.06], equating to -0.078 T/S [IQR(-0.092 to 0.176)] per year. Of note, telomere lengthening occurred in 30.4% of subjects. After adjustment for classical cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (age, gender, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure, glucose levels, lipid profile and therapies), TS was associated with incident subclinical carotid vascular damage [hazard ratio (HR) 5.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-22.4, P = 0.028]. Finally, subjects in whom LTL shortened over time showed an increased risk of incident CVE, compared to those in whom LTL lengthened (HR 1.69, CI 1.02-2.78, P = 0.041). Conclusion: These data indicate that TS is associated with increased risk of subclinical carotid vascular damage and increased incidence of CVEs beyond CVD risk factors in the general population, whereas LTL lengthening is protective.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.Background & Aims: In cirrhotic patients with renal failure, renal blood flow autoregulation curve is shifted to the right, which is consequent upon sympathetic nervous system activation and endothelial dysfunction. Albumin infusion improves renal function in cirrhosis by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We aimed to determine the effect of albumin infusion on systemic haemodynamics, renal blood flow, renal function and endothelial function in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury. Methods: Twelve patients with refractory ascites and 10 patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury were studied. Both groups were treated with intravenous albumin infusion, 40-60 g/days over 3-4 days. Cardiac and renal haemodynamics were measured. Endothelial activation/dysfunction was assessed using von Willebrand factor and serum nitrite levels. F2\u03b1 Isoprostanes, resting neutrophil burst and noradrenaline levels were quantified as markers of oxidative stress, endotoxemia and sympathetic activation respectively. Results: Albumin infusion leads to a shift in the renal blood flow autoregulation curve towards normalization, which resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow. Accordingly, improvement of renal function was observed. In parallel, a significant decrease in sympathetic activation, inflammation/oxidative stress and endothelial activation/dysfunction was documented. Improvement of renal blood flow correlated with improvement in endothelial activation (r = 0.741, P < 0.001). Conclusions: The data suggest that albumin infusion improves renal function in acutely decompensated cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury by impacting on renal blood flow autoregulation. This is possibly achieved through endothelial stabilization and a reduction in the sympathetic tone, endotoxemia and oxidative stress.",

We conduct a series of bivariate, multivariate, and multinomial statistical tests using a unique dataset of 119 lone-actor terrorists and a matched sample of group-based terrorists. The odds of a lone-actor terrorist having a mental illness is 13.49 times higher than the odds of a group actor having a mental illness. Lone actors who were mentally ill were 18.07 times more likely to have a spouse or partner who was involved in a wider movement than those without a history of mental illness. Those with a mental illness were more likely to have a proximate upcoming life change, more likely to have been a recent victim of prejudice, and experienced proximate and chronic stress. The results identify behaviors and traits that security agencies can utilize to monitor and prevent lone-actor terrorism events.

At the end of the slow decline phase of the X-ray and optical afterglow, this burst shows a sudden and prominent rebrightening in the optical band only, followed by a fast decay in both bands. The optical rebrightening also shows chromatic evolution. Such a puzzling behaviour cannot be explained by a single component model. We discuss other possible interpretations, and we find that a model that incorporates a long-lived reverse shock and forward shock fits the temporal and spectral properties of GRB100814 the best.",

On the external unit side, class-D and class-E power amplifiers (PAs) are conventionally used, thanks to their high efficiency at high frequencies. The initial specifications driving this study require the use of multiple independent stimulators, which imposes serious constraints on the area and functionality of the external unit. An integrated circuit class-D PA has been designed to provide both small area and enhanced functionality, the latter achieved by the addition of an on-chip (PLL) a dead-time generator and a phase detector. The PA was designed in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS high-voltage process technology and occupies an area of 9.86 mm2. It works at frequencies up to 14 MHz and 30-V supply and efficiencies higher than 80% are obtained at 14 MHz. The PA is intended for a closed-loop transmitter system that optimizes power delivery to medical implants.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2005 Richard Bellamy. All rights reserved.The rule of law is frequently invoked in political debate, yet rarely defined with any precision. Some employ it as a synonym for democracy, others for the subordination of the legislature to a written constitution and its judicial guardians. It has been seen as obedience to the duly-recognised government, a form of governing through formal and general rule-like laws and the rule of principle. Given this diversity of view, it is perhaps unsurprising that certain scholars have regarded the concept as no more than a self-congratulatory rhetorical device. This collection of eighteen key essays from jurists, political theorists and public law political scientists, aims to explore the role law plays in the political system. The introduction evaluates their arguments. The first eleven essays identify the standard features associated with the rule of law. These are held to derive less from any characteristics of law per se than from a style of legislating and judging that gives equal consideration to all citizens. The next seven essays then explore how different ways of separating and dispersing power contribute to this democratic style of rule by forcing politicians and judges alike to treat people as equals and regard none as above the law.",

            "DOI": "10.1287/mksc.2020.1223",
            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020 INFORMS.In common parlance, luxury and markdowns are, in many respects, contradictory concepts. Markdowns decrease product exclusivity and hence consumers\u2019 willingness to pay (i.e., snob effect) because most consumers purchasing luxury desire uniqueness. Markdowns also encourage strategic (forward-looking) consumers to wait for lower prices (i.e., strategic effect). Yet, luxury retailers frequently adopt markdowns in practice to stimulate the demand for their seasonal products (i.e., sales effect). To study the impact of these three countervailing effects on a luxury retailer\u2019s markdown policy and rationing strategy, this paper develops a game-theoretic model with strategic and exclusivity-seeking consumers who have heterogeneous (high and low) valuations. We character-ize a luxury retailer\u2019s equilibrium markdown and rationing strategies and find that the retailer induces a buying frenzy (i.e., selling deliberately less than the demand) to increase consumers\u2019 willingness to pay when they are sufficiently exclusivity seeking. We show that the retailer\u2019s markdown policy depends on consumers\u2019 desire for exclusivity when the proportion of consumers with high valuation is not too high or too low. Interestingly, we find that, in such cases, consumers\u2019 higher desire for exclusivity does not motivate the retailer to increase exclusivity and to adopt uniform pricing. To the contrary, it motivates the retailer to decrease the exclusivity and to adopt markdowns. By doing so, we identify exclusivity-seeking consumer behavior as another rationale behind markdown pricing. Last, we find that, when selling to exclusivity-seeking consumers, the negative impact of strategic consumer behavior is lower; however, ignoring it can be more costly.",

By the same token, in a context of spatially concentrated income-earning opportunities and other urban functions, as well as limited purchasing power, accessibility to adequate means of connectivity with the rest of the urban fabric can be a determining factor in overcoming conditions of poverty for residents in physically marginal areas.Within the framework of the splintering urbanism thesis, and using the case study of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia's capital city, we examine the apparent mismatch between the growth of low-income informal settlements in peripheral locations and the development of transport networks in the period 2000-2010. Our aim is to identify the effects on social and spatial marginalisation of an uneven provision of material infrastructures and services for mobility. We identify central elements in the structure of the networks of connectivity between Bogot\u00e1 and Soacha, highlighting the main gaps that lead to a fragmented set of connections. We develop a set of criteria for planners and policy makers searching for a more informed analysis of transport supply and policy development practice for poor peripheral populations in similar regions and contexts.",

The scope of this paper is to answer the following question: Can we schedule a nominal EChO mission, with targets known today (in mid 2013), given the science requirements, realistic performances and operational constraints? We examine this issue from the point of view of duration of the mission and the scheduling restrictions with a sample of exoplanet systems known nowadays. We choose different scheduling algorithms taking into account the science and operational constraints and we verified that it is fairly straightforward to schedule a mission scenario over the lifetime of EChO compliant with the science requirements. We identified agility as a critical constraint that reduces significantly the efficiency of the survey. We conclude that even with known targets today the EChO science objectives can be reached in the 4.5 years duration of the mission. We also show that it is possible to use gaps between exoplanet observations, to fit the required calibration observations, data downlinks and station keeping operations or even to observe more exoplanet targets to be discovered in the coming years.",

For all tumors, the association between ADCmean and SUVmean/ SUVmax values were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.Results: At baseline, the areas of 18F-choline uptake matched areas of contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion. There was a negative correlation trend between SUVmax and ADCmean and a positive correlation trend between SUVmax and tumor size. There was concordance between reduction in tumor size and reductions in SUVmax and SUVmean in 4 children, in three of whom ADCmean values were increased. In 2 patients, tumor size remained stable whereas SUVmax and SUVmean values were increased with reduction in the ADCmean values. Additionally, in 2 children, cross-sectional MRI showed an increase both in tumor size and SUVmax but a reduction in ADC values.Conclusions: Simultaneous 18F-choline PET/MRI is a promising and reliable imaging tool for children with astrocytic tumors, as it permits monitoring of morphological and metabolic response and changes during therapy.

A promising approach to minimize the effect of multipath interference and aid NLOS detection is vector tracking. Therefore, the objective of this research was to assess vector tracking in a dense urban environment to determine its effect on multipath interference and NLOS reception. Here, a vector delay lock loop is implemented using an adaptive extended Kalman filter. This replaces the individual code-tracking loops and navigation filter, but retains conventional carrier frequency tracking. The positioning and tracking performance of the conventional and vector-tracking implementations with and without a strobe correlator are compared using intermediate frequency signals recorded in the Koto-Ku district of urban canyon Tokyo city environment. Both static and dynamic tests were performed. It is shown that vector tracking reduces the root-mean-square positioning error by about 30 % compared with an equivalent conventional receiver in urban environments and is capable of detecting long-delay NLOS reception for a GPS receiver without any external aiding.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aim: Antipsychotics increase the risk of stroke. Their effect on myocardial infarction remains uncertain because people prescribed and not prescribed antipsychotic drugs differ in their underlying vascular risk making between-person comparisons difficult to interpret. The aim of our study was to investigate this association using the self-controlled case series design that eliminates between-person confounding effects. Methods and results: All the patients with a first recorded myocardial infarction and prescription for an antipsychotic identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project were selected for the self-controlled case series. The incidence ratio of myocardial infarction during risk periods following the initiation of antipsychotic use relative to unexposed periods was estimated within individuals. A classical case-control study was undertaken for comparative purposes comparing antipsychotic exposure among cases and matched controls. We identified 1546 exposed cases for the self-controlled case series and found evidence of an association during the first 30 days after the first prescription of an antipsychotic, for first-generation agents [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-3.99] and second-generation agents (IRR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.18-5.32). Similar results were found for the case-control study for new users of first- (OR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.9-5.37) and second-generation agents (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 0.93-7.01) within 30 days of their myocardial infarction. Conclusion: We found an increased risk of myocardial infarction in the period following the initiation of antipsychotics that was not attributable to differences between people prescribed and not prescribed antipsychotics.",

Their applications in sensing and therapeutics require easy synthesis with precise control over their dimensions. Here, we report a method for the synthesis of highly pure and monodisperse Au NRs with fine-tuneable dimensions and longitudinal localised surface plasmon resonance by addition of Hofmeister salts into the growth medium. The control of Au NR formation relies on the double interaction between salt-gold and salt-surfactant (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, CTAB). With the addition of Hofmeister salts (i.e. NaNO3, NaBr, NaCl and NaHSO4) we can fine-tune the aspect ratio of Au NRs in the range of 3.3 to 4.8 with a precision of 0.1 and the longitudinal absorption band from 777 to 960 nm. In addition, we have studied the physical changes in the CTAB micelles induced by the salts using rheology, electron microscopy and light-scattering techniques. We report for the first time cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the micelles under Au NR growth conditions. With the comprehensive characterization of CTAB micelles in the growth solution, this study provides a deeper understanding of the anisotropic growth of metallic crystals.",

This chapter reviews the challenges faced by cities and city managers before introducing how the Tyndall Centre cities programme is addressing some of these challenges. As much as 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions are the result of urban activity and it is therefore appropriate to analyse emissions and develop mitigation strategies at this scale. A regional economic model is used to provide the quantified economic scenarios that are the starting point for analysis of vulnerability and greenhouse gas emissions.

We sought to test the hypotheses that the mean cognitive score of new referrals to a secondary care memory assessment service increased while mean age decreased over a period of 20 years. We retrospectively analysed the data of 1476 patients. The passage of time was associated with a significant increase in mean cognitive scores, while there was no association between time and age after controlling for other factors.

            "Abstract": "Background/aims The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended the use of ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for diabetic macular oedema (DMO) as part of its health technology appraisal process. In the economic evaluations of both interventions, utility values were derived from members of the general public wearing contact lenses with a central opacity that was meant to simulate the blind spot experienced by many patients with advanced retinal disease. This paper tests the validity of the contact lens simulation, and finding it to be invalid, explores the impact on prior economic evaluations. Methods Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and visual fields were assessed with and without simulation lenses in five healthy subjects with normal vision. Results We identified important differences between the contact lens simulation and vision loss experienced by patients with AMD. The contact lens simulator did not cause the central scotoma which is characteristic of latestage AMD and which leads to severe difficulty with everyday activities such as reading or recognising faces and objects. The contact lens instead caused a reduction in retinal illumination experienced by the subjects as a general dimming across the retina. Conclusions A contact lens with a central opacity does not simulate a central scotoma. The clinical differences between simulated and actual AMD suggest there has been an underestimation of the severity of AMD health states. This brings into question the validity of the economic evaluations of treatments for AMD and DMO used by NICE.",

This assumption is violated when the models are fitted to an outcome variable that counts the number of correctly answered questions in a questionnaire. Examples include investigations of cognitive decline where models are fitted to Mini Mental State Examination scores, the most widely used test to measure global cognition. Mini Mental State Examination scores take integer values in the 0-30 range, and its distribution has strong ceiling and floor effects. This article explores alternative distributions for the outcome variable in mixed models fitted to mini mental state examination scores from a longitudinal study of ageing. Model fit improved when a beta-binomial distribution was chosen as the distribution for the response variable.",

Results from adult studies cannot be generalized to young people, especially taking into consideration research indicating that current generations are more comfortable disclosing sensitive information on computer-based media. This paper investigates the psychometric equivalence of the paper (N = 777) and computer (N = 777) formats of a child and adolescent self-report mental health measure, \"Me and My School\" (M&MS), completed by school pupils aged 8-14 years. Common practice in equivalence testing has been to use scale-level analysis and factor structure equivalence; the limitation being inability to assess format-based differences at the item-level. We conduct differential item functioning (DIF) analysis to assess whether item-response probability is different based on survey format. Results demonstrate that young people completing the M&MS on paper have lower scale-level overall scores. However, DIF analyses indicate that this difference is not explained by item-level probabilities. The results suggest that survey format equivalence testing of other widely used child and adolescent mental health measures may be necessary before data from different formats are directly compared or combined.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Cannabinoids are known to regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission via activation of presynaptic G protein-coupled cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs). Additionally, recent studies suggest that cannabinoids can also directly interact with recombinant GABAA receptors (GABAARs), potentiating currents activated by micromolar concentrations of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, the impact of this direct interaction on GABAergic inhibition in central nervous system is unknown. Here we report that currents mediated by recombinant GABAARs activated by high (synaptic) concentrations of GABA as well as GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at neocortical fast spiking (FS) interneuron to pyramidal neuron synapses are suppressed by exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids in a CB1R-independent manner. This IPSC suppression may account for disruption of inhibitory control of pyramidal neurons by FS interneurons. At FS interneuron to pyramidal neuron synapses, endocannabinoids induce synaptic low-pass filtering of GABAAR-mediated currents evoked by high-frequency stimulation. The CB1R-independent suppression of inhibition is synapse specific. It does not occur in CB1R containing hippocampal cholecystokinin-positive interneuron to pyramidal neuron synapses. Furthermore, in contrast to synaptic receptors, the activity of extrasynaptic GABAARs in neocortical pyramidal neurons is enhanced by cannabinoids in a CB1R-independent manner. Thus, cannabinoids directly interact differentially with synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs, providing a potent novel context-dependent mechanism for regulation of inhibition.",

All rights reserved.We report the first stochastic dynamic causal modeling (sDCM) study of effective connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. Thirty-three patients (9 women, mean age = 25.0 years, SD = 5) with a first episode of psychosis and diagnosis of schizophrenia - according to the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, revised criteria - were studied. Fifteen healthy control subjects (4 women, mean age = 24.6 years, SD = 4) were included for comparison. All subjects underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) interspersed with 2 periods of continuous picture viewing. The anterior frontal (AF), posterior cingulate (PC), and the left and right parietal nodes of the DMN were localized in an unbiased fashion using data from 16 independent healthy volunteers (using an identical fMRI protocol). We used sDCM to estimate directed connections between and within nodes of the DMN, which were subsequently compared with t tests at the between subject level. The excitatory effect of the PC node on the AF node and the inhibitory self-connection of the AF node were significantly weaker in patients (mean values = 0.013 and -0.048 Hz, SD = 0.09 and 0.05, respectively) relative to healthy subjects (mean values = 0.084 and -0.088 Hz, SD = 0.15 and 0.77, respectively; P <.05). In summary, sDCM revealed reduced effective connectivity to the AF node of the DMN - reflecting a reduced postsynaptic efficacy of prefrontal afferents - in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.",

Al rights reserved.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by several motor and phonic tics. Tics usually develop before 10 years of age, exhibit a waxing and waning course and typically improve with increasing age. A prevalence of approximately 1% is estimated in children and adolescents. The condition can result in considerable social stigma and poor quality of life, especially when tics are severe (for example, with coprolalia (swearing tics) and self-injurious behaviours) or when GTS is accompanied by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or another neuropsychiatric disorder. The aetiology is complex and multifactorial. GTS is considered to be polygenic, involving multiple common risk variants combined with rare, inherited or de novo mutations. These as well as non-genetic factors (such as perinatal events and immunological factors) are likely to contribute to the heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype, the structural and functional brain anomalies and the neural circuitry involvement. Management usually includes psychoeducation and reassurance, behavioural methods, pharmacotherapy and, rarely functional neurosurgery. Future research that integrates clinical and neurobiological data, including neuroimaging and genetics, is expected to reveal the pathogenesis of GTS at the neural circuit level, which may lead to targeted interventions.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.Background The amygdala is a central node in the brain network that processes aversive emotions and is extensively innervated by dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) neurons. Alterations in DRN 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor availability cause phenotypes characterized by fearful behavior in preclinical models. However, it is unknown whether 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor availability is linked specifically to the processing of aversive emotions in humans or whether it modulates connectivity in brain networks involved in emotion processing. To answer this question, we investigated the relationship between DRN 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor availability and amygdala reactivity to aversive emotion and functional connectivity within the amygdala-cortical network. Methods We studied 15 healthy human participants who underwent positron emission tomography scanning with [<sup>11</sup>C]CUMI-101, a 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> partial agonist radioligand, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain responses during an incidental emotion processing task including happy, fearful, and neutral faces. Regional estimates of 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor binding potential (nondisplaceable) were obtained by calculating total volumes of distribution for presynaptic DRN and amygdala. Connectivity between the amygdala and corticolimbic areas was assessed using psychophysiologic interaction analysis with the amygdala as the seed region. Results Analysis of the fear versus neutral contrast revealed a significant negative correlation between amygdala response and DRN binding potential (nondisplaceable) (r = -.87, p <.001). Availability of DRN 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptors positively correlated with amygdala connectivity with middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral precuneus, and left supramarginal gyrus for fearful (relative to neutral) faces. Conclusions Our data show that DRN 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor availability is linked specifically to the processing of aversive emotions in the amygdala and the modulation of amygdala-cortical connectivity.",

The brain is the mind\u2019s body and not all the connections that psychological experience makes with subsequent function can be made available through the study of a single domain. Similarly, the impact of psychoanalysis cannot be fully appreciated from clinical material alone. It may be that difficulty in pinpointing the curative factors in psychoanalytic treatment is directly related to the limitations of uniquely clinical basis for inquiry. A cultural shift characterizes the last decades of this century, with both professionals and the lay public switching from an environmental model of psychopathology to a genetic\u2013biological frame of reference that excludes consideration of psychodynamic aspects.",

We use comparable nationally representative cohort studies to examine racial/ethnic disparities in mean body mass index (BMI) and in the odds of obesity/overweight in the UK and US. The contribution of sociodemographic, cultural and family routine factors are assessed.Methods:Data on BMI, obesity and overweight in 5-year-old children from the MCS (Millennium Cohort Study) and ECLS-B (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort) were examined. We investigated race/ethnic disparities in mean BMI and in the odds of obesity and overweight, as compared to normal weight. We assessed the independent contribution of sociodemographic, cultural and family routine factors to observed disparities.Results:In the UK, after adjustment for sociodemographic, cultural and family routine factors and maternal BMI, we found Black Caribbean children to have higher odds ratio (OR=1.7, confidence interval (CI)=1.1-2.6), Pakistani children to have lower odds of obesity (OR=0.60, CI=0.37-0.96) and Black African children were more likely to be overweight (OR=1.40, CI=1.04-1.88). In the US, in fully adjusted models, there were no race/ethnic disparities in children's odds of obesity and overweight.Conclusion:Disparities for Bangladeshi children in the UK and Mexican, other Hispanic and American Indian children in the US can be explained by socioeconomic disadvantage, whereas a range of cultural and family characteristics partially explain disparities for other groups in the UK. Future public health initiatives focused on reducing risk of overweight and obesity should consider the diverse socioeconomic and cultural profiles of all race/ethnic groups.",

The West Siberian/Caspian/Nile populations of Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans) regularly overwinter and stop over in Iran, and are considered an economically and culturally important group of birds in the country. Conservation of such migratory birds requires the identification of key threat factors impacting them throughout the flyway. Since documented data on the status and threats facing Anatidae in Iran are very scarce, in this paper, we attempted to determine the general population trends for the 26 Anatidae species in Iran, using annual waterbird census data, and to identify and score the most important threat factors affecting each species, by consulting the top ornithologists and professional birdwatchers in the country by means of a survey. Our results indicate that the most prevalent threats affecting all 26 species are dam construction, water management practices, and hunting. Our results provide the necessary material for Red List assessment of these species at the national level, an important tool for conservation priority setting within Iran and in the flyway.",

Methods: A total of 205 HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive self-described API patients received 48 weeks of TDF 300 mg (HVL n = 18) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg (HVL n = 15) in a blinded fashion, followed by open-label TDF for an additional 240 weeks. The proportions of HVL vs. non-HVL patients with HBV DNA <400 copies/ml were compared. Mean declines in HBV DNA were evaluated in API vs. non-API patients. Results: Throughout the first 72 weeks of treatment, a smaller proportion of HVL API patients reached HBV DNA <400 copies/ml than non-HVL API patients. However, after this timepoint similar proportions of HVL and non-HVL API patients achieved HBV DNA <400 copies/ml (100% vs. 97%, respectively), which was maintained through week 288, where 92% of HVL patients and 99% of non-HVL API patients on treatment had HBV DNA <400 copies/ml. During the 288 weeks of treatment, API patients had similar mean HBV DNA declines as non-API patients, regardless of whether patients were HVL or non-HVL. No API HVL patient had persistent viremia at week 288. No resistance was detected among HVL or non-HVL patients. Conclusions: API patients with HVL CHB achieve HBV DNA <400 copies/ml with long-term TDF treatment; however, achieving viral suppression may take longer for HVL patients relative to non-HVL API patients.",

Firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributions as a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of Spitzer, Herschel, LABOCA, and AzTEC data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objects and strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. We found that the mean intensity of the radiation field \u3008U\u3009 heating the dust (strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshift up to z = 4 in main-sequence galaxies. We can reproduce this evolution with simple models that account for the decrease in the gas metallicity with redshift. No evolution of \u3008U\u3009 with redshift is found in strong starbursts.We then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as Mmol/(Mmol + M\u2217)) with redshift and found a similar, steeply increasing trend for both samples. At z \u223c 4, this fraction reaches \u223c60%. The average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locus of the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that the bulk of the star formation up to z = 4 is dominated by secular processes.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.Drawing on data gathered during ethnographic fieldwork in a south-western Chinese town, this paper examines a detailed case study of a single family, and how their internet use transformed over an 18-month period following the introduction of home broadband to their house. Despite initial intentions that the connection would resolve the problem of errant offspring accessing the internet outside the home, the subsequent effects that home internet brought upon domestic life were largely unforeseen. The detailed narrative presented herein highlights how different family members' perceptions and actual use of the internet generated multiple contradictions over the fieldwork period. This paper argues that Silverstone, R., Hirsch, E., & Morley, D.\u2019s (1992). Information and communication technologies and the moral economy of the household. In R. Silverstone & E. Hirsch (Eds.), Consuming technologies: Media and information in domestic spaces (pp. 15\u201331). London: Routledge] theory of domestication provides the most suitable model for understanding the introduction of information and communication technologies into the home, owing to its capacity to take into account how attitudes towards the internet are renegotiated over time. The paper proposes further refinements be made to the theory by challenging the assumption that users aspire to \u2018incorporate\u2019 the technology into the household. Instead, the ethnographic data indicate that the main drivers of the domestication process are family members' desires to use the internet as a way to transform relationships within the household. More broadly, by foregrounding participants' concerns regarding internet use as focusing chiefly on family life and education, this paper also provides an important alternative to prevailing scholarly trends that generally understand the Chinese internet through themes of politics, censorship and democracy.",

This study shows that the difference between raw and processed image data is system specific. The results have shown that there are no significant differences between raw and processed data in the mean threshold contrast values using the contrast-detail mammography phantom in all the systems investigated; however, these results cannot be generalised to all available systems. Notable differences were noted in contrast-to-noise ratios and in other tests including: response function, modulation transfer function , noise equivalent quanta, normalised noise power spectra and detective quantum efficiency as specified in IEC 62220-1-2. Consequently, the authors strongly recommend the use of raw data for all image quality analyses in digital mammography.",

Healthcare providers (HCPs) who interact with pregnant smokers may have valuable insights into their development and use. Aims: To explore HCPs' views of using digital smoking cessation interventions with pregnant women in order to inform the design and delivery of digital smoking cessation interventions. Methods: Two structured focus groups were conducted with HCPs (n = 16) who provided smoking cessation support for pregnant women in England. Discussions covered participants' general views about digital smoking cessation interventions, the potential of such interventions for smoking cessation support for pregnant smokers, and recommendations for future intervention development. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: HCPs identified a variety of ways in which digital interventions could benefit pregnant smokers, such as by providing anonymity, offering consistent quality of advice, and being available on demand. The identified limitations of digital smoking cessation interventions included lack of access among those most economically disadvantaged, the need for high levels of self-motivation, and lack of human contact. Addressing pregnant smokers' negative perceptions of smoking cessation support, providing rewarding experiences, and tailoring the intervention to smokers' level of confidence were among HCPs' recommendations. Conclusions: HCPs indicated that digital interventions offer a range of potential benefits that could make them useful for pregnant smokers. Nonetheless, important limitations and recommendations regarding their design and delivery were identified and these need to be addressed in intervention development.",

This article reviews recent findings on the role of personality traits for psychological outcomes for carers of people with dementia.Recent findings: Several studies have now established that personality influences the caregiving experience, carer wellbeing and outcomes such as coping ability, burden and caregiving style. Several moderators of these associations have also been identified such as the effect of kinship and type of dementia. There is consistent evidence that carer personality characteristics influence the progression of the disease such as cognitive decline and severity. Most of the recent studies identified in this review are cross-sectional.Summary: Taken together, these results indicate that personality is an important psychological resource for carers. Recent findings indicate that personality traits are associated with and influence both carer and patient outcomes. Future research is necessary to guide interventions and to expand further on our understanding of how personality factors shape adjustment to the caregiving role and how these impact on the progression of the disease. \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",

One-dimensional systems provide fundamental insights because they are often amenable to exact methods. However, no exact solution is known for the experimentally relevant case of external confinement. We propose a powerful ansatz for the one-dimensional Fermi gas in a harmonic potential near the limit of infinite short-range repulsion. For the case of a single impurity in a Fermi sea, we show that our ansatz is indistinguishable from numerically exact results in both the few- and many-body limits. We further derive an effective Heisenberg spin-chain model corresponding to our ansatz, valid for any spin-mixture, within which we obtain the impurity eigenstates analytically. In particular, the classical Pascal\u2019s triangle emerges in the expression for the ground-state wave function. As well as providing an important benchmark for strongly correlated physics, our results are relevant for emerging quantum technologies, where a precise knowledge of one-dimensional quantum states is paramount.",

It is the most frequent chronic neurologic condition of childhood, affecting 0.5%\u20131% of children worldwide. It comprises a variety of disorders with many different etiologies, consequently affecting management and outcome. Although the great majority of children have epilepsies that are self-limited and have a good prognosis, it is nevertheless very well recognized that epileptic activity (be it seizures or interictal discharges) can be particularly deleterious to the developing brain acting as a disruptor to normal developmental function. Indeed, epilepsy and neurocognitive and behavioral disorders very frequently coexist, and it can be challenging to understand if there is causality or if they are all the reflection of the underlying brain disorder. Hence, accurate phenotypic and etiologic diagnosis is of utmost importance as it will not only guide decision making with regard to choice of treatment but also enable management of expectations concerning outcome. The current chapter aims to provide a general overview of the fast evolving and vast field of childhood epilepsy from its definition and epidemiology, to its diagnostic challenges, management, and outcome.",

The proposed model, in the linear approximation, can be compared to the well-known equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An appropriate kinetic energy is identified, and we present a dynamical model of rotational elasticity. The propagation of elastic waves in such a medium is studied and we find two classes of waves, transversal rotational waves and longitudinal rotational waves, both of which are solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations. For certain parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be greater than the longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are identified where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases the potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the rotational waves to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the coupled system. We find wave-like solutions to the coupled equations and can visualise our results with the help of suitable figures.",

Bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries was performed whenever possible to classify patients as MES-positive or MES-negative. Results: Data from 31 asymptomatic, 46 'early symptomatic' and 35 'late symptomatic' patients were analysed. Peak thrombin (344.2 nM vs 305.3 nM; p=0.01) and endogenous thrombin potential (1772.4 vs 1589.7; p=0.047) were higher in early symptomatic than asymptomatic patients. Peak thrombin production decreased in symptomatic patients followed up from the early to late phase after TIA or stroke (339.7 nM vs 308.6 nM; p=0.02). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound data were available in 25 asymptomatic, 31 early symptomatic and 27 late symptomatic patients. Early symptomatic MES-positive patients had a shorter 'time-to-peak thrombin' than asymptomatic MES-positive patients (p=0.04), suggesting a more procoagulant state in this early symptomatic subgroup. Discussion: Thrombin generation potential is greater in patients with recently symptomatic than asymptomatic carotid stenosis, and decreases over time following TIA or stroke associated with carotid stenosis. These data improve our understanding of the haemostatic/thrombotic biomarker profile in moderate-severe carotid stenosis.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The British Psychological Society.Objectives Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often perceived as being difficult to treat. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that treatment non-response in routine clinical practice is often due to failures in the delivery of treatment, and that most patients who are apparently treatment-resistant will respond to treatment if adequately delivered. Design Retrospective cohort data analysis. Methods Forty-three young people with severe, treatment-resistant OCD (defined as Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [CY-BOCS] scores \u226530 and non-response to previous cognitive behaviour therapy [CBT] and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) were referred to a specialist clinic and completed a course of manualized CBT, with (N = 21) or without (N = 22) optimization of medication. A sub-sample (N = 15) completed a semi-structured interview to determine characteristics of their previous CBT; quality was assessed according to pre-determined criteria. Results Specialist treatment was associated with significant reductions in OCD symptoms at post-treatment with gains maintained at 3-month follow-up. At the 3-month follow-up, 58% of patients showed a meaningful clinical response (\u226535% drop on the CY-BOCS) and 22% were in remission (\u226412 on the CY-BOCS). Patients whose medication was optimized tended (non-significantly) to have better responses. The quality of previous CBT was assessed in a sub-group of participants and rated as inadequate in 95.5% of cases. The most common inadequacy was insufficient focus on exposure techniques. Conclusions These findings provide support for the notion that treatment non-response in routine practice may be due to technical treatment failures and highlight the need to disseminate good quality evidence-based treatment among this population. Research is also needed to understand factors that impede outcome to further improve response and remission rates. Practitioner points Among young people with OCD, failure to respond to treatment in routine clinical practice may often reflect the nature of the treatment received. Exposure techniques may often be overlooked in CBT for OCD, potentially resulting in poor therapeutic response. Most young people with severe and apparent treatment-resistant OCD respond to outpatient CBT incorporating E/RP. Further research is needed to establish effective methods for disseminating good quality CBT for OCD.",

However, it is not trivial to generate subcategories of high quality, due to the difficulty in measuring the similarity between positive instances. In this letter we propose a new weakly supervised clustering method to achieve better sub-categorization. Our method provides a more precise measurement of the similarity by aligning the positive instances through latent variables and filtering the aligned features. As a better alternative to the initialization step of the latent-SVM algorithm for the learning of the multi-component models, our method can lead to a superior performance gain for object detection. We demonstrate this on various real-world datasets.",

Combined EEG-fMRI has been shown to help to characterise brain networks involved in epileptic activity, as well as in different sensory, motor and cognitive functions. A good understanding of the electrophysiological correlates of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal is necessary to interpret fMRI maps, particularly when obtained in combination with EEG. We review the current understanding of electrophysiological-haemodynamic correlates, during different types of brain activity. We start by describing the basic mechanisms underlying EEG and BOLD signals and proceed by reviewing EEG-informed fMRI studies using fMRI to map specific EEG phenomena over the entire brain (EEG-fMRI mapping), or exploring a range of EEG-derived quantities to determine which best explain colocalised BOLD fluctuations (local EEG-fMRI coupling). While reviewing studies of different forms of brain activity (epileptic and nonepileptic spontaneous activity; cognitive, sensory and motor functions), a significant attention is given to epilepsy because the investigation of its haemodynamic correlates is the most common application of EEG-informed fMRI. Our review is focused on EEG-informed fMRI, an asymmetric approach of data integration. We give special attention to the invasiveness of electrophysiological measurements and the simultaneity of multimodal acquisitions because these methodological aspects determine the nature of the conclusions that can be drawn from EEG-informed fMRI studies. We emphasise the advantages of, and need for, simultaneous intracranial EEG-fMRI studies in humans, which recently became available and hold great potential to improve our understanding of the electrophysiological correlates of BOLD fluctuations.

This work adopts a social network approach and seeks to explicate the nature of medicine-taking work that people with multiple long-term conditions (LTCs) and their social network members (SNMs) do in attempting to take their medications on a daily basis, the division of labour amongst thesemembers andwhen and why SNMs become involved in thatwork. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 people who had multiple LTCs. Medication networks were constructed and the division of labour in relation to medication-work was explored. Results: Four types of medication-work emerged: medication articulation, surveillance, emotional and informational. Involvement of SNMs in medication-work was selective, performed primarily by family members, within the home. Involvement reflected network composition and/or an individuals conceptualisation/presentation of self. Discussion: Our findings support and extend the conceptualisation of routine medicine-taking as a type of work. Furthermore, we illustrate the involvement of SNMs in aspects of medicine-work. Health professionals should explore and support the role of SNMs in medicine-taking where possible. Future research should explore the implications of network types and compositions on medicine-taking and associated work.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Purpose: To present and validate a manifold learning (ML)-based method that can estimate both cardiac and respiratory navigator signals from electrocardiogram (ECG)-free free-breathing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to achieve self-gated retrospective CINE reconstruction. Materials and Methods: In this work the use of the ML method is demonstrated for 2D cardiac CINE to achieve both cardiac and respiratory self-gating without the need of an external navigator or ECG signal. This is achieved by sequentially applying ML to two sets of retrospectively reconstructed real-time images with differing temporal resolutions. A 1D cardiac signal is estimated by applying ML to high temporal resolution real-time images reconstructed from the acquired data. Using the estimated cardiac signal, a 1D respiratory signal was obtained by applying the ML method to low temporal resolution images reconstructed from the same acquired data for each cardiac cycle. Data were acquired in five volunteers with a 2D golden angle radial trajectory in a balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) acquisition. The accuracy of the estimated cardiac signal was calculated as the standard deviation of the temporal difference between the estimated signal and the recorded ECG. The correlation between the estimated respiratory signal and standard pencil beam navigator signal was evaluated. Gated CINE reconstructions (20 cardiac phases per cycle, temporal resolution \u223c30 msec) using the estimated cardiac and respiratory signals were qualitatively compared against conventional ECG-gated breath-hold CINE acquisitions. Results: Accurate cardiac signals were estimated with the proposed method, with an error standard deviation in comparison to ECG lower than 20 msec. Respiratory signals estimated with the proposed method achieved a mean cross-correlation of 94% with respect to standard pencil beam navigator signals. Good quality visual scores of 2.80 \u00b1 0.45 (scores from 0, bad, to 4, excellent quality) were observed for the proposed approach in comparison with the conventional ECG-gated breath-hold images (visual score: 3.00 \u00b1 0.71). Conclusion: Accurate respiratory and cardiac navigator signals can be estimated using the proposed framework from the acquired data itself, resulting in retrospective self-gated CINE reconstruction with high spatial and temporal quality.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Fluid intelligence (fluid IQ), defined as the capacity for rapid problem solving and behavioral adaptation, is known to be modulated by learning and experience. Both stressful life events (SLES) and neural correlates of learning [specifically, a key mediator of adaptive learning in the brain, namely the ventral striatal representation of prediction errors (PE)] have been shown to be associated with individual differences in fluid IQ. Here, we examine the interaction between adaptive learning signals (using a well-characterized probabilistic reversal learning task in combination with fMRI) and SLES on fluid IQ measures. We find that the correlation between ventral striatal BOLD PE and fluid IQ, which we have previously reported, is quantitatively modulated by the amount of reported SLES. Thus, after experiencing adversity, basic neuronal learning signatures appear to align more closely with a general measure of flexible learning (fluid IQ), a finding complementing studies on the effects of acute stress on learning. The results suggest that an understanding of the neurobiological correlates of trait variables like fluid IQ needs to take socioemotional influences such as chronic stress into account.",

This paper presents the current state of critical backlog maintenance within the National Health Service (NHS) in England through the statistical analyses of 115 Acute NHS Trusts. It aims to find empirical support for a causal relationship between building portfolio age and year-on-year increases in critical backlog. It makes recommendations for the use of building portfolio age in strategic asset management. The current trend across this sample of NHS Trusts may be typical of the whole NHS built asset portfolio and suggests that most Trusts need to invest between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent of income (depending upon current critical backlog levels and Trust age profile) to simply maintain critical backlog levels. More robust analytics for building age, condition and risk-adjusted backlog maintenance are required.",

Trauma triggers the attachment system. As John Bowlby pointed out, it inhibits exploration and activates affectional bonds. Brain studies and fossil records suggest that self-awareness most likely evolved in order to aid other awareness. Closely associated with evolutionary changes in social intelligence were changes in human brain structure. There was a modest proportional expansion (about 10%) in parts of the prefrontal cortex, with an increased richness of interconnections between neurones in these areas. The neurobiology of attachment is fairly well understood. In brief it seems that changes in attachment behaviour, such as falling in love, which are stimulated by social/sexual activity, entails the activation of an oxytocin and vasopressin sensitive circuit within the anterior hypothalamus (MPOA) linked to the VTA and the nucleus accumbens shell.",

In diabetes mellitus, anaemia is frequently unrecognized, yet studies have shown that it is twice as common in diabetics compared with nondiabetics. We aimed to assess the incidence of anaemia and further classify the iron deficiency seen in a high-risk DFU patient group. Methods. An observational study was undertaken in a multidisciplinary diabetic foot clinic setting. All patients with DFU attending over a four-month period were included. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin (Hb) levels <12 g/dL. Iron deficiency was classified according to definitions of AID (absolute iron deficiency) and FID (functional iron deficiency). Results. 27 patients had DFU; 14 (51.9%) were anaemic; two (7.41%) had severe anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dL). No patient had B12 or Folate deficiency. In patients with anaemia, there was significant spread of indices. Only one patient had \"textbook\" absolute iron deficiency (AID) defined as low Hb, MCV, MCH, and ferritin. Functional iron deficiency (FID) was seen in a further seven patients (25.5%). Conclusion. Anaemia and iron deficiency are a common problem in patients with DFU. With current clinical markers, it is incredibly difficult to determine causal relationships and further in-depth scientific study is required.",

The conditions required for this to happen are investigated and the impact on social welfare is discussed.

This research suggests that the hippocampus may code the path to the goal while the entorhinal cortex represents the vector to the goal.

The present study sought to confirm and further validate the factor structure of the VASQ in a large community convenience sample. The VASQ was completed by a large sample of men and women (N = 1236) as part of an online survey. The data were randomly split to allow both independent exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to be conducted. A four-factor model consisting of two types of proximity-seeking (lack of autonomy and anxious-dependent) and insecurity (ambivalent and avoidant-dismissive) attachment patterns proved to be the best-fitting measurement model in this sample (X<sup>2</sup> = 186.7, df = 71, p <.001; CFI =.945, TLI =.929, RMSEA =.05). Although similar to the original questionnaire, the new factor structure resulted in the elimination of several items. Validity was confirmed with the shortened VASQ as similar associations with mood, stress, eating pathology and sex were observed for both the new shortened VASQ and original version of the VASQ. The structure of the VASQ was broadly consistent with the original solution although some items were removed and both subscales were further split into two sub-factors. Future research should use this tool in clinical and non-clinical groups to provide further support for its factor structure and to determine the clinical and theoretical usefulness of the different subscales.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 UICC.The MC1R gene is a key regulator of skin pigmentation. We aimed to evaluate the association between MC1R variants and the risk of sporadic cutaneous melanoma (CM) within the M-SKIP project, an international pooled-analysis on MC1R, skin cancer and phenotypic characteristics. Data included 5,160 cases and 12,119 controls from 17 studies. We calculated a summary odds ratio (SOR) for the association of each of the nine most studied MC1R variants and of variants combined with CM by using random-effects models. Stratified analysis by phenotypic characteristics were also performed. Melanoma risk increased with presence of any of the main MC1R variants: the SOR for each variant ranged from 1.47 (95%CI: 1.17-1.84) for V60L to 2.74 (1.53-4.89) for D84E. Carriers of any MC1R variant had a 66% higher risk of developing melanoma compared with wildtype subjects (SOR; 95%CI: 1.66; 1.41-1.96) and the risk attributable to MC1R variants was 28%. When taking into account phenotypic characteristics, we found that MC1R-associated melanoma risk increased only for darker-pigmented Caucasians: SOR (95%CI) was 3.14 (2.06-4.80) for subjects with no freckles, no red hair and skin Type III/IV. Our study documents the important role of all the main MC1R variants in sporadic CM and suggests that they have a direct effect on melanoma risk, independently on the phenotypic characteristics of carriers. This is of particular importance for assessing preventive strategies, which may be directed to darker-pigmented Caucasians with MC1R variants as well as to lightly pigmented, fairskinned subjects.",

However, it may have much to teach us about how trade mark law operates in practice, particularly in the context of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u2019s (CJEU) case law, which, because of the structure of EU trade mark law, is necessarily quite abstract. This study employs empirical methods to understand how the test for the likelihood of confusion is operated by the courts. Influenced by developments in US academic writing, this is the first European study to employ empirical methodology to investigate which factors are having the most influence on how courts decide whether likely confusion is present in the cases. This study seeks to establish whether the factors adumbrated by the CJEU are being correctly applied by the lower courts. Although the authors found that the CJEU\u2019s test is generally being applied, this study identifies the fact that the General Court is largely ignoring one of the factors, the distinctiveness of the senior trade mark.",

All rights reserved.Purpose: Falls are a recognised problem for people with long-term neurological conditions but less is known about fall risk in young adults. This study describes fallers' and falls' characteristics in adults less than 60 years old, in a neuro-rehabilitation unit. Methods: This single-centre, longitudinal, observational study included 114 consecutive admissions to a UK neuro-rehabilitation unit over 20 months. The demographic and clinical characteristics of eligible patients included age, sex, diagnosis, hospital length of stay and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Falls were recorded prospectively in a fall report, using the activities and environmental domains of the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). Results: A total of 34 (30%) patients reported a fall, with 50% experiencing more than one fall. The majority of falls (60%) occurred during the first 2 weeks, during day-time (90%) and during mobile activities (70%). Overall, falls rate (95% confidence interval) was 1.33 (1.04 to 1.67) per 100 d of patient hospital stay. Factors associated with increased falls included becoming a walker during admission or being cognitively impaired. There were no serious fall-related injuries. Conclusion: The first 2 weeks of admission is a high risk time for fallers, in particular those who become walkers or are cognitively impaired. Prevention policies should be put in place based on fall characteristics. Implications for Rehabilitation \u2022 The ICF is a valuable instrument for describing subject and environmental factors during a fall-event. \u2022 Falls are frequent events but do not usually cause serious injuries during inpatient rehabilitation. \u2022 There is an increased fall risk for subjects with cognitive impairments or those relearning how to walk.",

Perhaps this was an unfortunate classification which I seemed to have rather too quickly internalized. However, in one sense I think he was drawing attention to those of us who, despite medical training (the field for scientists who cannot do maths!), had an interest in an understanding of humanity and the human condition of a more philosophical literary kind. When I first came across Henri Rey at the Maudsley, it was not so much his complex classification of psychosis that first grabbed me; it was the way he could succinctly describe the essence of a patient\u2019s dilemma in a simple and compassionate way which both moved and greatly impressed me. I had a similar emotional experience and depth that I get from a work of literature, or, say, from watching a Beckett play. How did he get there from the same data that I had just heard and yet had not even left first base? So, that was what I went looking for, and I found it, or at least the path 58to it, through psychoanalysis: my own and later, that of my patients.",

Assuming that the number of factors used in estimation is larger than the true number of factors in the data, we establish the limiting distribution of the LS estimator for the regression coefficients as the number of time periods and the number of cross-sectional units jointly go to infinity. The main result of the paper is that under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution of the LS estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the estimation as long as this number is not underestimated. The important practical implication of this result is that for inference on the regression coefficients, one does not necessarily need to estimate the number of interactive fixed effects consistently.",

Feistle.Background: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is associated with significant mortality, progression to end-stage renal disease and recurrence post transplantation. The deficiency of CFHR plasma proteins and autoantibody-positive hemolytic uremic syndrome (DEAP-HUS) has a more favorable outcome. Guidelines suggest plasma therapy be initiated within 24 hours of presentation of aHUS. Presentation of aHUS, particularly, DEAP-HUS is associated with a diarrheal prodrome in up to 53% of patients and initiation of appropriate therapies is frequently delayed. Cases: We report on 3 patients with DEAP-HUS, who presented with a diarrheal prodrome that delayed diagnosis and initiation of plasma therapy past the 24-hour window recommended. C3 was low in 2 cases at presentation. All patients had positive complement factor H (CFH) autoantibodies. Despite delay in initiating plasma therapy, all 3 cases remitted with restoration of normal renal function following initial presentation. One patient had a relapse but responded to further plasma exchange and immunosuppression. The remaining 2 patients were relapse-free without maintenance immunosuppression. Conclusion: Our cases highlight the complexity of diagnosing DEAP-HUS due to the common occurrence of diarrhea in the prodromal phase and the subsequent delay in initiating of plasma therapy. We therefore advocate a low threshold for testing CFH autoantibodies in ambiguous cases where there is no history of bloody diarrhea or Shiga-toxin exposure.",

The voids in the antifluorite structure that are crucial for superionicity in Li2O might also act as atomic traps. Trapping of guest atoms and small molecules within voids of a host structure leads to the formation of what are known as clathrate compounds. Here we investigate the possibility of trapping helium or larger neon guest atoms under pressure within alkali-metal oxide and sulfide structures. We find stable helium and neon-bearing compounds at very low pressures. These structures are stabilized by a reduction in volume from incorporation of helium or neon atoms within the antifluorite structure. We predict that NeCs2S could be stable at ambient pressure. Our study suggests a novel class of alkali oxide and sulfide materials incorporating noble-gas atoms that might potentially be useful for gas storage.",

In this paper, we focus on universities in Canada to provide an integrative review of the changing sociospatial relations of cities and universities in an era of increasing neoliberal and globalized development agendas. We treat these relationships in spatial and institutional terms, recognizing that actors and decision-makers in government and academic bodies understand their links as a combination of both. Our analysis destabilizes established normative understandings regarding the sociospatial structure and governance of the university and the interrelations between universities and urban space. Numerous spatial strategies demonstrate that universities\u2019 relations are multi-layered, multi-scaled and multiply topological. Yet while they may be well positioned to adopt a proactive role in shaping economic development and civic agendas, universities have no privileged position in their communities. Despite acting as deliberate place-making agents in rapidly changing metropolitan environments, universities remain located in, yet apart from, their urban and regional context.",

With increasing financial demands on the health service and patients to recover from tendon and ligament injuries faster, and with less morbidity, health professionals are exploring new treatment options. Tissue engineering may provide the answer, with its unlimited source of natural cells that in the correct environment may improve repair and regeneration of tendon and ligament tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated the ability to self renew and have multilineage differentiation potential. The use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells has been reported, however significant in vitro culture expansion is required due to the low yield of cells, which has financial implications. Harvesting of bone marrow cells also has associated morbidity. Several studies have looked at alternative sources for mesenchymal stem cells. Reports in literature from animal studies have been encouraging, however further work is required. This review assesses the potential sources of mesenchymal stem cells for tissue engineering in tendons and ligaments.",

Recent findings in a variety of alphabetic languages converge on the conclusion that there are 3 \"cognitive foundations\" for learning to read: letter-sound knowledge, phonemic awareness, and rapid automatized naming skills. Deficits in each of these skills appear causally related to problems in learning to read, and deficits in letter-sound knowledge and phonemic awareness appear to be remediable by suitable teaching. The authors argue that this evidence has important practical implications for early education and for the diagnosis and treatment of children with reading difficulties. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

Accordingly, this research aims to demonstrate that the notion of risk-bearing capacity (RBC) can be drawn upon as a new dimension to the analysis and design of project governance. An effort is made to link this concept with the definitions of governance employed within the literature of transaction cost economics and corporate governance. The RBC approach distinguishes itself from extant views of project governance through its ability to quantitatively integrate organizational (e.g., delivery system), contractual (e.g., risk-sharing ratio) and financial (e.g., insurance cover) measures. This novel approach provides an avenue for incorporating the project's historical construction and operating data into the design of project governance; an advantage with the potential to exponentially increase as a torrent of digital data is made available through the deployment of emergent information technologies (e.g. building information modelling).",

All rights reserved.Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and is a major cause of vision loss in middle-aged and elderly people. One-third of people with diabetes have DR. Severe stages of DR include proliferative DR, caused by the abnormal growth of new retinal blood vessels, and diabetic macular oedema, in which there is exudation and oedema in the central part of the retina. DR is strongly associated with a prolonged duration of diabetes, hyperglycaemia and hypertension. It is traditionally regarded as a microvascular disease, but retinal neurodegeneration is also involved. Complex interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by hyperglycaemia underlie the development of DR. These mechanisms include genetic and epigenetic factors, increased production of free radicals, advanced glycosylation end products, inflammatory factors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Optimal control of blood glucose and blood pressure in individuals with diabetes remains the cornerstone for preventing the development and arresting the progression of DR. Anti-VEGF therapy is currently indicated for diabetic macular oedema associated with vision loss, whereas laser photocoagulation prevents severe vision loss in eyes with proliferative DR. These measures, together with increasing public awareness and access to regular screening for DR with retinal photography, and the development of new treatments to address early disease stages, will lead to better outcomes and prevent blindness for patients with DR.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2002 IEEE.The ponderomotive forces associated with the interference pattern of two crossing laser beams can effectively perturb the translational motion of atoms, molecules and electrons. The ponderomotive force sets up a density perturbation among the dipoles moving synchronously with the interference pattern. Possiblities of using ponderomotive-driven density perturbations for plasma diagnostics are discussed. For example, coherent Rayleigh scattering is a process in which a laser beam is Bragg-scattered off a traveling atom or molecule number density wave created by ponderomotive forces. The strength of the signal is directly related to the number of atoms or molecules whose velocities are closely synchronized with the traveling wave, the thermal velocity distribution. We show that coherent Rayleigh scattering is applicable to the measurement of neutral temperature in weakly ionized plasmas. Experimental results are given for glow discharges. We also discuss the possibility of acoustic detection of energy deposition by optical lattice generated with two crossing laser beams. Again, ponderomotive forces perturb the translational motion of gas particles and energy is transferred from laser beams into the gas. Numerical calculation shows that the power deposition is a function of the laser beams' frequency difference. And such a power deposition curve bears the information of the gas particles' Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, therefore, gas temperature can be derived from such a measurement.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Zhang et al.Conficker is a computer worm that erupted on the Internet in 2008. It is unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing, neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that combines three modes of spreading: local, neighbourhood, and global, to capture the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conficker epidemic. The model is then used to explore the tradeoff between spreading modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics. Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population. When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to current internet security protocols.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Cambridge University Press.Background. Domestic and sexual violence are significant public health problems but little is known about the extent to which men and women with severe mental illness (SMI) are at risk compared with the general population. We aimed to compare the prevalence and impact of violence against SMI patients and the general population. Method. Three hundred and three randomly recruited psychiatric patients, in contact with community services for \u22651 year, were interviewed using the British Crime Survey domestic/sexual violence questionnaire. Prevalence and correlates of violence in this sample were compared with those from 22 606 general population controls participating in the contemporaneous 2011/12 national crime survey. Results. Past-year domestic violence was reported by 27% v. 9% of SMI and control women, respectively [odds ratio (OR) adjusted for socio-demographics, aOR 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-4.0], and by 13% v. 5% of SMI and control men, respectively (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.8). Past-year sexual violence was reported by 10% v. 2.0% of SMI and control women respectively (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.8). Family (non-partner) violence comprised a greater proportion of overall domestic violence among SMI than control victims (63% v. 35%, p < 0.01). Adulthood serious sexual assault led to attempted suicide more often among SMI than control female victims (53% v. 3.4%, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Compared to the general population, patients with SMI are at substantially increased risk of domestic and sexual violence, with a relative excess of family violence and adverse health impact following victimization. Psychiatric services, and public health and criminal justice policies, need to address domestic and sexual violence in this at-risk group.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s). Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked disorder characterised by cardiac and skeletal myopathy, growth delay, neutropenia and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA). Patients have TAZ gene mutations which affect metabolism of cardiolipin, resulting in low tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin (CL 4 ), an increase in its precursor, monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), and an increased MLCL/CL 4 ratio. During development of a diagnostic service for BTHS, leukocyte CL 4 was measured in 156 controls and 34 patients with genetically confirmed BTHS. A sub-group of seven subjects from three unrelated families was identified with leukocyte CL 4 concentrations within the control range. This had led to initial false negative disease detection in two of these patients. MLCL/CL 4 in this subgroup was lower than in other BTHS patients but higher than controls, with no overlap between the groups. TAZ gene mutations in these families are all predicted to be pathological. This report describes the clinical histories of these seven individuals with an atypical phenotype: some features were typical of BTHS (five have had cardiomyopathy, one family has a history of male infant deaths, three have growth delay and five have 3-MGCA) but none has persistent neutropenia, five have excellent exercise tolerance and two adults are asymptomatic. This report also emphasises the importance of measurement of MLCL/CL 4 ratio rather than CL 4 alone in the biochemical diagnosis of the BTHS.",

We analyse the electoral breakthroughs of AERPs in central and eastern Europe (CEE), the region where AERPs have so far been most successful. Examples include the Simeon II National Movement, Movement for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) (Bulgaria), Res Publica (Estonia), New Era (Latvia), TOP09 and Public Affairs (Czech Republic) and Positive Slovenia. We examine the conditions under which such parties broke through in nine CEE states in 1997\u20132012 using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). We find five sufficient causal paths combining high or rising corruption, rising unemployment and party system instability. Rising corruption plays a key role in most pathways but, unexpectedly, AERP breakthroughs are more closely associated with economic good times than bad.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background: We evaluated the mortality due to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in 229 neonatal departments participating in the German national neonatal infection surveillance system between 2000 and 2011. Methods: For each infection type, we conducted a retrospective cohort study and a case-control study. In the cohort studies, the mortality risk due to BSI and/or NEC was estimated by calculating adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazard regression with time the dependent variable infection. In the matched case-control studies, the attributable mortality was calculated. Results: A total of 43,116 VLBW infants, of which 6911 patients had at least 1 BSI and 1271 patients had at least 1 NEC, were analyzed. Overall mortality was 6.6%. Patients with at least 1 BSI had a mortality of 5.6%, and patients with at least 1 NEC had a mortality of 19.2%. The cohort studies revealed that BSI (AHR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.61-2.08) and NEC (AHR = 6.35; 95% CI: 5.47-7.37) are independently associated with increased mortality. In the case-control study for BSI, 5187 (75.1%) patients with BSI were matched. Attributable mortality was 1.4% (95% CI: 0.7-2.2). In the case-control study for NEC, 1092 (85.9%) patients with NEC were matched. Attributable mortality was 14.7% (95% CI: 12.2-17.1). Conclusions: Nosocomial BSI and NEC increased mortality in VLBW infants. BSI, however, was associated with a relatively small attributable mortality of 1.4%, whereas NEC had a high attributable mortality of 14.7%.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.There is currently no consistent approach to modelling galaxy bias evolution in cosmological inference. This lack of a common standard makes the rigorous comparison or combination of probes difficult. We show that the choice of biasing model has a significant impact on cosmological parameter constraints for a survey such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), considering the two-point correlations of galaxies in five tomographic redshift bins. We find that modelling galaxy bias with a free biasing parameter per redshift bin gives a Figure of Merit (FoM) for dark energy equation of state parameters w0, wa smaller by a factor of 10 than if a constant bias is assumed. An incorrect bias model will also cause a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters. Motivated by these points and focusing on the redshift evolution of linear bias, we propose the use of a generalized galaxy bias which encompasses a range of bias models from theory, observations and simulations, b(z) = c + (b0 - c)/D(z)\u03b1, where parameters c, b0 and \u03b1 depend on galaxy properties such as halo mass. For a DES-like galaxy survey, we find that this model gives an unbiased estimate of w0, wa with the same number or fewer nuisance parameters and a higher FoM than a simple b(z) model allowed to vary in z-bins. We show how the parameters of this model are correlated with cosmological parameters. We fit a range of bias models to two recent data sets, and conclude that this generalized parametrization is a sensible benchmark expression of galaxy bias on large scales.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014.Background: light-to-moderate drinking is apparently associated with a decreased risk of physical limitations in middle-aged and older adults. Objective: to investigate the association between alcohol consumption and physical limitations in Eastern European populations. Study design: a cross-sectional survey of 28,783 randomly selected residents (45-69 years) in Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland) and seven towns of Czech Republic. Methods: physical limitations were defined as <75% of optimal physical functioning using the Physical Functioning (PF-10) Subscale of the Short-Form-36 questionnaire. Alcohol consumption was assessed by a graduated frequency questionnaire, and problem drinking was defined as \u22652 positive responses on the CAGE questionnaire. In the Russian sample, past drinking was also assessed. Results: the odds of physical limitations were highest among non-drinkers, decreased with increasing drinking frequency, annual consumption and average drinking quantity and were not associated with problem drinking. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of physical limitations in non-drinkers versus regular moderate drinkers was 1.61 (95% confidence interval: 1.48-1.75). In the Russian sample with past drinking available, the adjusted OR in those who stopped drinking for health reasons versus continuing drinkers was 3.19 (2.58-3.95); ORs in lifetime abstainers, former drinkers for non-health reasons and reduced drinkers for health reasons were 1.27 (1.02-1.57), 1.48 (1.18-1.85) and 2.40 (2.05-2.81), respectively. Conclusion: this study found an inverse association between alcohol consumption and physical limitations. The high odds of physical limitations in non-drinkers can be largely explained by poor health of former drinkers. The apparently protective effect of heavier drinking was partly due to less healthy former heavy drinkers who moved to lower drinking categories.",

Setting: University teaching hospital. Methods: Fifty healthy volunteers and 50 voice disorder patients had supervised recordings in a quiet room using OperaVOX by the iPod's internal microphone with sampling rate of 45 kHz. A five-seconds recording of vowel/a/was used to measure fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR). All healthy volunteers and 21 patients had a second recording. The recorded voices were also analysed using the MDVP. The inter- and intrasoftware reliability was analysed using intraclass correlation (ICC) test and Bland-Altman (BA) method. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the acoustic parameters between healthy volunteers and patients. Results: Nine of 50 patients had severe aperiodic voice. The ICC was high with a confidence interval of >0.75 for the inter- and intrasoftware reliability except for the NHR. For the intersoftware BA analysis, excluding the severe aperiodic voice data sets, the bias (95% LOA) of F0, jitter, shimmer and NHR was 0.81 (11.32, -9.71); -0.13 (1.26, -1.52); -0.52 (1.68, -2.72); and 0.08 (0.27, -0.10). For the intrasoftware reliability, it was -1.48 (18.43, -21.39); 0.05 (1.31, -1.21); -0.01 (2.87, -2.89); and 0.005 (0.20, -0.18), respectively. Normative data from the healthy volunteers were obtained. There was a significant difference in all acoustic parameters between volunteers and patients measured by the Opera-VOX (P < 0.001) except for F0 in females (P = 0.87). Conclusion: OperaVOX is comparable to MDVP and has high internal consistency for measuring the F0, jitter and shimmer of voice except for the NHR.",

The analysis was based on images of spray development, spark discharge and combustion to understand the effects of early and late injection strategies on in-cylinder phenomena. Specifically, 'single'-injection strategies from early to late intake stroke as well as multiple 'split' injection events with triple pulses in the early intake stroke or double pulses in the intake stroke and late compression stroke were investigated. The engine was run at 1500 r/min at part- and full-load conditions (0.5 and 1.0 bar inlet plenum pressure, respectively). Engine coolant temperatures of 20\u00b0C-90\u00b0C were employed to understand how fuel volatility was related to the phenomena observed. The sprays were imaged over a series of cycles primarily by laser sheet illumination on one vertical and two horizontal planes to identify three-dimensional aspects of the spray's development and its interactions with the incoming flow, valves, piston and liner. There was a clear fuel-impingement trade-off between early and late injection timings. The spark discharge was also imaged with all injection strategies and clear differences were observed. Selective combustion imaging provided insights into the flame's growth and motion with early and double early-late split injection strategies. The double earlylate injection strategy demonstrated the potential for control of the mixture formation and flow field over the early flame development stage of combustion.",

The most basic model is called simple assembly line balancing problem type 1 (SALBP-1). We provide a survey on 12 heuristics and 9 lower bounds for this model and test them on a traditional and a lately-published benchmark dataset. The present paper focuses on algorithms published before 2011. We improve an already existing dynamic programming and a tabu search approach significantly. These two are also identified as the most effective heuristics; each with advantages for certain problem characteristics.

All rights reserved.Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and are members of the 'Cys-loop' family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). Acetylcholine binds in the receptor extracellular domain at the interface between two subunits and research has identified a large number of nAChR-selective ligands, including agonists and competitive antagonists, that bind at the same site as acetylcholine (commonly referred to as the orthosteric binding site). In addition, more recent research has identified ligands that are able to modulate nAChR function by binding to sites that are distinct from the binding site for acetylcholine, including sites located in the transmembrane domain. These include positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), silent allosteric modulators (SAMs) and compounds that are able to activate nAChRs via an allosteric binding site (allosteric agonists). Our aim in this article is to review important aspects of the pharmacological diversity of nAChR allosteric modulators and to describe recent evidence aimed at identifying binding sites for allosteric modulators on nAChRs.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.We consider an optimal trading problem over a finite period of time during which an investor has access to both a standard exchange and a dark pool. We take the exchange to be an order-driven market and propose a continuous-time setup for the best bid price and the market spread, both modeled by L\u00e9vy processes. Effects on the best bid price arising from the arrival of limit buy orders at more favorable prices, the incoming market sell orders potentially walking the book, and deriving from the cancellations of limit sell orders at the best ask price are incorporated in the proposed price dynamics. A permanent impact that occurs when 'lit' pool trades cannot be avoided is built in, and an instantaneous impact that models the slippage, to which all lit exchange trades are subject, is also considered. We assume that the trading price in the dark pool is the mid-price and that no fees are due for posting orders. We allow for partial trade executions in the dark pool, and we find the optimal trading strategy in both venues. Since the mid-price is taken from the exchange, the dynamics of the limit order book also affects the optimal allocation of shares in the dark pool. We propose a general objective function and we show that, subject to suitable technical conditions, the value function can be characterized by the unique continuous viscosity solution to the associated partial integro-differential equation. We present two explicit examples of the price and the spread models, derive the associated optimal trading strategy numerically. We discuss the various degrees of the agent's risk aversion and further show that roundtrips are not necessarily beneficial.",

We call a curve \u03b3 in \u211dd (\u2264k)-crossing if it intersects every hyperplane at most k times (counted with multiplicity). The (\u2264d)-crossing curves in \u211dd are often called convex curves and they form an important class; a primary example is the moment curve {(t, t2, . . . , td) : t \u2208 [0, 1]}. They are also closely related to Chebyshev systems, which is a notion of considerable importance, e.g., in approximation theory. Our main result is that for every d there is M = M(d) such that every (\u2264d+1)-crossing curve in \u211dd can be subdivided into at most M (\u2264d)-crossing curve segments. As a consequence, based on the work of Eli\u00e1\u0161, Rold\u00e1n, Safernov\u00e1, and the second author, we obtain an essentially tight lower bound for a geometric Ramsey-type problem in \u211dd concerning order-type homogeneous sequences of points, investigated in several previous papers.",

Methods: 37 patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary BSP (19 patients had tonic orbicularis oculi (OO) spasms and 18 patients had clonic OO spasms) and 8 patients with IB were included in this case-control study. All subjects underwent a standardised video protocol and clinical evaluation with a validated questionnaire designed to identify eye symptoms and Blepharospasm Disability Index (BSDI) before and 1 month after BoNT injection. BR was measured from the video recording before and after BoNT. BR in BSP and IB patients was compared with that from a group of healthy subjects and from a group of patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS). BR in HFS was also measured before and after BoNT. Results: BR was increased in patients with IB and in BSP patients with clonic spasms but not in BSP patients with tonic spasms. BoNT reduced BR in patients with IB and in patients with clonic spasms, but not in patients with tonic spasms. BoNT left BR in patients with HFS unchanged. Changes in BR after BoNT were also independent of the presence of ocular symptoms. Despite the differential response of BR, BoNT significantly reduced BSDI in patients with BSP and IB. Conclusions: BoNT differentially modulates BR in patients with BSP and IB depending on the baseline BR. BoNT injection reduces BR only when the blink generator is overactive, possibly influencing tear film retention.",

We present a patient with transient epileptic amnesia and a left temporal seizure focus, who developed isolated compulsive versifying, producing multiple rhyming poems, following seizure cessation induced by lamotrigine. Functional neuroimaging studies in the healthy brain implicate left frontotemporal areas in generating novel verbal output and rhyme, while dysregulation of neocortical and limbic regions occurs in temporal lobe epilepsy. This case complements previous observations of emergence of altered behavior with reduced seizure frequency in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Such cases suggest that reduced seizure frequency has the potential not only to stabilize or improve memory function, but also to trigger complex, specific behavioral alterations.",

The book focuses on the issue of scarcity: less of a problem for the supply of resources in general, but relevant in the dimension of global demand forecasting when relative shortages match with regional constraints and environmental consequences. It highlights the regional patterns of growth and trade in relation to natural resources. The book presents a theoretical basis for some of the empirical literature, with a focus on the links between stock market pricing and innovation dynamics. It demonstrates that technological catch-up across countries can be attributed to large natural resource rent fluctuations during the 1970-1990 period while the absence of natural resource rents in the last part of that period explains the decline of productivity improvements. The book highlights two country studies, on Finland and Greece.",

All rights reserved.The tremendous expansion of population research over the last 50 years has proceeded on many levels, from genes and microorganisms to national and global entities. Elementary procedures of population definition are crucial because they shape possible lines of inquiry: the kinds of phenomena that can be recognized, how they are explored, varying research outcomes, and applications to human problems. Conventional statistical procedures, in specifying parameters at the outset of inquiry, are inappropriate when research objectives are to identify unknown relationships and discover parameters that may capture them. Central problems of population heterogeneity-the configuration of alleles in gene expression, the dynamics of species subgroups, the many shifting subgroups in national populations-thus require new, more open, methodologies. Developments in evolutionary biology and compositional demography reviewed here suggest that, while research functions on many levels, a common ground of problems and approaches is emerging in many parts of the human sciences.",

However, BeadChip processing relies on traditional bisulfite (BS) based protocols which cannot discriminate between 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we report the adaptation of the recently developed oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) chemistry to specifically detect both 5mC and 5hmC in a single workflow using 450K BeadChips, termed oxBS-450K. Supported by validation using mass spectrometry and pyrosequencing, we demonstrate reproducible (R2>0.99) detection of 5hmC in human brain tissue using the optimised oxBS-450K protocol described here.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry.Background: Neurofilaments (Nf) are major structural proteins that occur exclusively in neurons. In spinal cord injury (SCI), the severity of disease is quantified by clinical measures that have limited sensitivity and reliability, and no blood-based biomarker has been established to further stratify the degree of injury. We aimed to examine a serum-based NfL immunoassay as predictor of the clinical outcome in SCI. Methods: Longitudinal measurement of serum NfL was performed in patients with central cord syndrome (CCS, n=4), motor-incomplete SCI (iSCI, n=10), motorcomplete SCI (cSCI, n=13) and healthy controls (HC, n=67), and correlated with clinical severity, neurological outcome, and neuroprotective effect of the drug minocycline. Results: Baseline NfL levels were higher in iSCI (21 pg/mL) and cSCI (70 pg/mL) than in HC (5 pg/mL, p=0.006 and p<0.001) and CCS (6 pg/mL, p=0.025 and p=0.010). Levels increased over time (p<0.001) and remained higher in cSCI versus iSCI (p=0.011) and than in CCS (p<0.001). NfL levels correlated with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score at baseline (r=-0.53, p=0.004) and after 24 h (r=-0.69, p<0.001) and 3-12-month motor outcome (baseline NfL: r=-0.43, p=0.026 and 24 h NfL: r=-0.72, p<0.001). Minocycline treatment showed decreased NfL levels in the subgroup of cSCI patients. Conclusions: Serum NfL concentrations in SCI patients show a close correlation with acute severity and neurological outcome. Our data provide evidence that serum NfL is of prognostic value in SCI patients for the first time. Further, blood NfL levels may qualify as drug response markers in SCI.",

Thanks to the high-quality photometry obtained, we discovered three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram. The populations are all concentrated towards the cluster's center. Although several explanations can be invoked to explain these sequences, we are left with two competitive but intriguing scenarios: a population of unresolved binaries with an exotic mass ratio distribution, or three populations with different ages. Independent high-resolution spectroscopy supports the presence of discrete episodes of star formation, each separated by about a million years. The stars from the two putative youngest populations rotate faster than the older ones, in agreement with the evolution of stellar rotation observed in pre-main sequence stars younger than 4 Myr in several star forming regions. Whatever the final explanation, our results prompt a revised look at the formation mode and early evolution of stars in clusters.",

All rights reserved.While much recent research has focused on understanding isolated cascades of networks, less attention has been given to dynamical processes on networks exhibiting repeated cascades of opposing influence. An example of this is the dynamic behaviour of financial markets where cascades of buying and selling can occur, even over short timescales. To model these phenomena, a stochastic pulse-coupled oscillator network with upper and lower thresholds is described and analysed. Numerical confirmation of asynchronous and synchronous regimes of the system is presented, along with analytical identification of the fixed point state vector of the asynchronous mean field system. A lower bound for the finite system mean field critical value of network coupling probability is found that separates the asynchronous and synchronous regimes. For the low-dimensional mean field system, a closed-form equation is found for cascade size, in terms of the network coupling probability. Finally, a description of how this model can be applied to interacting agents in a financial market is provided.",

All rights reserved.Background Although diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) carries the worst prognosis of all pediatric brain tumors, studies on prognostic factors in DIPG are sparse. To control for confounding variables in DIPG studies, which generally include relatively small patient numbers, a survival prediction tool is needed. Methods A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed in the Netherlands, the UK, and Germany with central review of clinical data and MRI scans of children with DIPG. Cox proportional hazards with backward regression was used to select prognostic variables (P <. 05) to predict the accumulated 12-month risk of death. These predictors were transformed into a practical risk score. The model's performance was validated by bootstrapping techniques. Results A total of 316 patients were included. The median overall survival was 10 months. Multivariate Cox analysis yielded 5 prognostic variables of which the coefficients were included in the risk score. Age \u22643 years, longer symptom duration at diagnosis, and use of oral and intravenous chemotherapy were favorable predictors, while ring enhancement on MRI at diagnosis was an unfavorable predictor. With increasing risk score categories, overall survival decreased significantly. The model can distinguish between patients with very short, average, and increased overall survival (medians of 7.0, 9.7, and 13.7 mo, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.68. Conclusions We developed a DIPG survival prediction tool that can be used to predict the outcome of patients and for stratification in trials. Validation of the model is needed in a prospective cohort.",

Most of the controversy has been centred upon the fairness of the structural adjustment conditions and the effects of these conditions on economic development and on the human rights practices of loan recipients. The most careful quantitative research on selection criteria has focused on the IMF and has given disproportionate attention to potential economic selection criteria. The World Bank also was less likely to give a loan to a country involved in interstate conflict. Structural adjustment conditions required by the Bank and IMF are intended to encourage recipient governments to adopt what World Bank and IMF staff refer to as &#x91;good governance&#x92; policies.

Contrary to the law\u2019s conception of trademarks, brands are used to indicate far more than source and/or quality. This volume begins the process of broadening the legal understanding of brands by explaining what brands are and how they function, how trademark and antitrust/competition law have misunderstood brands, and the implications of continuing to ignore the role brands play in business competition. This is the first book to engage with the topic from an interdisciplinary perspective, hence it will be a must-have for all those interested in the phenomenon of brands and how their function is recognized by the legal system. The book integrates both a competition and an intellectual property law dimension and explores the regulatory environment and case law in both Europe and the United States.",

Methods: In time-mated pregnant does a left diaphragmatic defect was created at d23 (term=31). At d28, previously operated fetuses were assigned to either TO and injection with 70\u03bcL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 1.0\u00d7106 c-Kit positive hAFSC expressing LacZ or were left untouched (CDH). Harvesting was done at d31 to obtain their lung-to-body weight ratio (LBWR), airway and vascular lung morphometry, X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and surfactant protein-B (SP-B). Results: CDH-induced pulmonary hypoplasia is countered by TO+PBS, this reverses LBWR, mean terminal bronchiole density (MTBD) and medial thickness to normal. The additional injection of hAFSC decreases MTBD and results in a non-significant decrease in muscularization of intra-acinary vessels. There were no inflammatory changes and LacZ positive hAFSC were dispersed throughout the lung parenchyma 4days after injection. Conclusion: HAFSC exert an additional effect on TO leading to a decrease in MTBD, a measure of alveolar number surrounding the terminal bronchioles, without signs of toxicity.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies.Background: Substantial epidemiological research has shown that psychotic experiences are more common in densely populated areas. Many patients with persecutory delusions find it difficult to enter busy social urban settings. The stress and anxiety caused by being outside lead many patients to remain in-doors. We therefore developed a brief CBT intervention, based upon a formulation of the way urban environments cause stress and anxiety, to help patients with paranoid thoughts to feel less distressed when outside in busy streets. Aims: The aim was to pilot the new intervention for feasibility and acceptability and gather preliminary outcome data. Method: Fifteen patients with persecutory delusions in the context of a schizophrenia diagnosis took part. All patients first went outside to test their reactions, received the intervention, and then went outside again. Results: The intervention was considered useful by the patients. There was evidence that going outside after the intervention led to less paranoid responses than the initial exposure, but this was only statistically significant for levels of distress. Conclusions: Initial evidence was obtained that a brief CBT module specifically focused on helping patients with paranoia go outside is feasible, acceptable, and may have clinical benefits. However, it could not be determined from this small feasibility study that any observed improvements were due to the CBT intervention. Challenges in this area and future work required are outlined.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Empirical fragility curves, constructed from databases of thousands of building-damage observations, are commonly used for earthquake risk assessments, particularly in Europe and Japan, where building stocks are often difficult to model analytically (e.g. old masonry structures or timber dwellings). Curves from different studies, however, display considerable differences, which lead to high uncertainty in the assessed seismic risk. One potential reason for this dispersion is the almost universal neglect of the spatial variability in ground motions and the epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction. In this paper, databases of building damage are simulated using ground-motion fields that take account of spatial variability and a known fragility curve. These databases are then inverted, applying a standard approach for the derivation of empirical fragility curves, and the difference with the known curve is studied. A parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of various assumptions on the results. By this approach, it is concluded that ground-motion variability leads to flatter fragility curves and that the epistemic uncertainty in the ground-motion prediction equation used can have a dramatic impact on the derived curves. Without dense ground-motion recording networks in the epicentral area empirical curves will remain highly uncertain. Moreover, the use of aggregated damage observations appears to substantially increase uncertainty in the empirical fragility assessment. In contrast, the use of limited randomly-chosen un-aggregated samples in the affected area can result in good predictions of fragility.",

Objectives: This study aims to validate an electrophysiological test battery as a tool to diagnose patients with functional tremor with a \"laboratory-supported\" level of certainty. Methods: For this prospective data collection study, we recruited 38 new patients with functional tremor (mean age 37.9\u00b124.5 years; mean disease duration 5.9\u00b19.0 years) and 73 new patients with organic tremor (mean age 55.4\u00b125.4 years; mean disease duration 15.8\u00b117.7 years). Tremor was recorded at rest, posture (with and without loading), action, while performing tapping tasks (1, 3, and 5Hz), and while performing ballistic movements with the less-affected hand. Electrophysiological tests were performed by raters blinded to the clinical diagnosis. We calculated a sum score for all performed tests (maximum of 10 points) and used a previously suggested cut-off score of 3 points for a diagnosis of laboratory-supported functional tremor. Results: We demonstrated good interrater reliability and test-retest reliability. Patients with functional tremor had a higher average score on the test battery when compared with patients with organic tremor (3.6\u00b11.4 points vs 1.0\u00b10.8 points; P < .001), and the predefined cut-off score for laboratory-supported functional tremor yielded a test sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 95.9%. Conclusion: We now propose this test battery as the basis of laboratory-supported criteria for the diagnosis of functional tremor, and we encourage its use in clinical and research practice.",

The effects of chronic infection include cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. As a result of shared routes of transmission, co-infection with HIV is a substantial problem, and individuals infected with both viruses have poorer outcomes than do peers infected with one virus. No effective vaccine exists, although persistent HCV infection is potentially curable. The standard of care has been subcutaneous interferon alfa and oral ribavirin for 24-72 weeks. This treatment results in a sustained virological response in around 50% of individuals, and is complicated by clinically significant adverse events. In the past 10 years, advances in HCV cell culture have enabled an improved understanding of HCV virology, which has led to development of many new direct-acting antiviral drugs that target key components of virus replication. These direct-acting drugs allow for simplified and shortened treatments for HCV that can be given as oral regimens with increased tolerability and efficacy than interferon and ribavirin. Remaining obstacles include access to appropriate care and treatment, and development of a vaccine.",

The principal symbol of our operator is assumed to be trace-free. We study the spectral function which is the sum of squares of Euclidean norms of eigenfunctions evaluated at a given point of the manifold, with summation carried out over all eigenvalues between zero and a positive \u03bb. We derive an explicit two-term asymptotic formula for the spectral function as \u03bb \u2192+\u221e, expressing the second asymptotic coefficient via the trace of the subprincipal symbol and the geometric objects encoded within the principal symbol-metric, torsion of the teleparallel connection and topological charge. We then address the question: is our operator a massless Dirac operator on half-densities? We prove that it is a massless Dirac operator on half-densities if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied at every point of the manifold: (a) the subprincipal symbol is proportional to the identity matrix; and (b) the second asymptotic coefficient of the spectral function is zero. \u00a9 2013 \u00a9 2013 London Mathematical Society.",

Here we use a multifractal approach to study the time dynamics of the recent earthquake activity in the Corinth rift. The results indicate the degree of heterogeneous clustering and correlations acting at all time scales that suggest non-Poissonian behavior. Additionally, the multifractal analysis in different time periods showed that the degree of multifractality exhibits strong variations with time, which are associated with the dynamic evolution of the earthquake activity in the rift and the transition between periods of high and low seismicity.",

            "Abstract": "& Sons, Ltd.Reconstruction of the bladder wall via in vitro differentiated stem cells on an appropriate scaffold could be used in such conditions as cancer and neurogenic urinary bladder. This study aimed to examine the potential of human endometrial stem cells (EnSCs) to form urinary bladder epithelial cells (urothelium) on nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds, for construction of the urinary bladder wall. After passage 4, EnSCs were induced by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and seeded on electrospun collagen-V, silk and silk-collagen nanofibres. Later we tested urothelium-specific genes and proteins (uroplakin-Ia, uroplakin-Ib, uroplakin-II, uroplakin-III and cytokeratin 20) by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology were used to detect cell-matrix interactions. DMEM/F12 supplemented by KGF and EGF induced EnSCs to express urothelial cell-specific genes and proteins. Either collagen, silk or silk-collagen scaffolds promoted cell proliferation. The nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds provided a three-dimensional (3D) structure to maximize cell-matrix penetration and increase differentiation of the EnSCs. Human EnSCs seeded on 3D nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds and differentiated to urothelial cells provide a suitable source for potential use in bladder wall reconstruction in women. \u00a9 2015 John Wiley",

Here, we present the first quantitative analysis of pterosaurian biogeography based on an event-based parsimony method (Treefitter). This approach was applied to a phylogenetic tree comprising the relationships of 108 in-group pterosaurian taxa, spanning the full range of this clade's stratigraphical and geographical extent. The results indicate that there is no support for the impact of vicariance or coherent dispersal on pterosaurian distributions. However, this group does display greatly elevated levels of sympatry. Although sampling biases and taxonomic problems might have artificially elevated the occurrence of sympatry, we argue that our results probably reflect a genuine biogeographical signal. We propose a novel model to explain pterosaurian distributions: pterosaurs underwent a series of \u2018sweep-stakes\u2019 dispersal events (across oceanic barriers in most cases), resulting in the founding of sympatric clusters of taxa. Examination of the spatiotemporal distributions of pterosaurian occurrences indicates that their fossil record is extremely patchy. Thus, while there is likely to be genuine information on pterosaurian diversity and biogeographical patterns in the current data-set, caution is required in its interpretation.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Objectives: We sought association of genetic variants in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and vitamin Dsystem with acute pancreatitis (AP) development and severity. Background: The endocrine RAS is involved in circulatory homeostasis through the pressor action of angiotensin II at its AT1 receptor. However, local RAS regulate growth and inflammation in diverse cells and tissues, and their activity may be suppressed by vitamin D. Intrapancreatic angiotensin II generation has been implicated in the development of AP. Methods: Five hundred forty-four white patients with AP from 3 countries (United Kingdom, 22; Germany, 136; and The Netherlands 386) and 8487 control subjects (United Kingdom 7833, The Netherlands 717) were genotyped for 8 polymorphisms of the RAS/vitamin D systems, chosen on the basis of likely functionality. Results: The angiotensin-converting enzyme I (rather than D) allele was significantly associated with alcohol-related AP when all cohorts were combined (P = 0.03). The renin rs5707 G (rather than A) allele was associated with AP (P = 0.002), infected necrosis (P = 0.025) and mortality (P = 0.046). Conclusions: The association of 2 RAS polymorphisms with AP suggests the need for further detailed analysis of the role of RAS/vitamin D in the genesis or severity of AP, particularly given the ready potential for pharmacological manipulation of this system using existing marketed agents. However, further replication studies will be required before any such association is considered robust, particularly given the significant heterogeneity of AP causation and clinical course.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, RILEM.A considerable number of reinforced concrete buildings in European countries were built before the 1970s according to rules and principles which are now obsolete, and using reinforcing bars with plain surface that do not guarantee proper bond properties. Most existing studies concerning the characterization of the bond\u2013slip relationship have been carried out on elements built with deformed reinforcing bars. The bond\u2013slip relationship for plain bars is still not well known, and current empirical expressions are found not to take into account all the factors that influence bond\u2013slip performance. This paper presents the results of ten sets of pull-out tests (nine monotonic and one cyclic) performed on specimens built with hot-rolled plain bars. One additional set of specimens built with deformed bars was tested monotonically to highlight the difference, in terms of bond\u2013slip relationship, between plain and deformed rebars. Based on the experimental results, new empirical expressions are proposed for the parameters adopted in one of the more recent bond\u2013slip models for plain bars available in the literature. The new empirical expressions take into account the concrete compressive strength, rebar yield stress, embedded length and bar diameter, and are an improvement on existing expressions. Finally, a new monotonic bond\u2013slip model is proposed, which better represents the bond\u2013slip relationship after the peak strength.",

Those studies that have been carried out are also not widely known in the field. To help address the second point, in 2011, we carried out a review of the evidence base for psychodynamic psychotherapy for children and adolescents, which identified 35 studies which together provided some preliminary evidence for this treatment for a range of childhood disorders. The present study is an updated review, focusing on research published between March 2011 and November 2016. During this period, 23 additional studies were published, of which 5 were reports on randomised controlled trials, 3 were quasi-experimental controlled studies and 15 were observational studies. Although most studies covered children with mixed diagnoses, there were a number of studies examining specific diagnostic groups, including children with depression, anxiety and disruptive disorders. whilst the quality of studies was mixed, some were well-designed and reported, and overall indicated promising findings. Nevertheless, further high-quality research is needed in order to better understand the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy across a range of different disorders, and to ensure that services can provide a range of evidence-based treatments for children and young people.",

Historically the diagnosis for patients with EL who have no systemic features of MFS is isolated EL (IEL). However, the Ghent nosology for MFS was updated in 2010 and made some important alterations. In particular, patients with EL and a FBN1 mutation are now categorically diagnosed with MFS, if their mutation has previously been described with aortic dilation/dissection. This carries significant systemic implications, as many patients previously diagnosed with IEL are now reclassified. We provide a review of all published cases of IEL caused by FBN1 mutations over the last 20years to assess what impact the new Ghent nosology has on these. Indeed, 57/123 probands (46.3%) are now classified as MFS according to the revised Ghent nosology and 37/96 mutations (38.5%) reported to cause isolated EL have also been found in patients with aortic dilation/dissection. These findings suggest that EL caused by mutations in FBN1 is actually part of a spectrum of fibrillinopathies with MFS, and the term 'IEL' should be avoided in such cases.",

The behaviour of a system is viewed as a mapping from traces of high (unobservable) events to low (observable) events: the less the degree of dependency of low events on high traces, the more secure the system. We take the abstract view that low events are drawn from a generic semiring, where they can be combined using product and sum operations; throughout the paper, we provide instances of this framework, obtained by concrete instantiations of the underlying semiring. We specify systems via a simple process calculus, whose semantics is given as the unique homomorphism from the calculus into the set of behaviours, i.e. formal power series, seen as a final coalgebra. We provide a compositional semantics for the calculus in terms of rational operators on formal power series and show that the final and the compositional semantics coincide. This compositional, syntax-driven framework lays a foundation for automation and abstraction of a quantified approach to flow security of system specifications.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 International Society of Nephrology.Recently, intradialytic hypertension was reported to be associated with increased mortality for hemodialysis patients. To determine whether volume status plays a role in dialysis-associated hypertension, we prospectively audited 531 patients that had volume assessments measured by multiple-frequency bioelectrical impedance during their midweek dialysis session. Mean pre- and postdialysis weights were 73.2 vs 71.7 kg, and systolic blood pressures (SBPs) 140.5 vs. 130.3 mm Hg, respectively. Patients were divided into groups based on a fall in SBP of 20 mm Hg or more (32%), an increased SBP of 10 mm Hg or more (18%), and a stable group (50%). There were no differences in patient demographics, dialysis prescriptions, predialysis weight, total body (TBW), and extracellular (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW). However, the change in weight was significantly less in the increased blood pressure group (1.01 kg vs. stable 1.65, and 1.7 hypotensive). The ratio of ECW to TBW was significantly higher in the increased blood pressure group, particularly post dialysis (39.1 vs. stable 38.7% and fall in blood pressure group 38.7%). ECW overhydration was significantly greater in the increased blood pressure group post dialysis (0.7 (0.17 to 1.1) vs. stable 0.39 (-0.2 to 0.95) and fall in blood pressure group 0.38 (-0.19 to 0.86) liter). We found that patients who had increased blood pressure post dialysis had greater hydration status, particularly ECW. Thus, patients who increase their blood pressure post dialysis should have review of target weight, consideration of lowering the post-dialysis weight, and may benefit from increasing dialysis session time or frequency.",

Nutrient pool and factorial design experiments were carried out in order to identify the amino acids involved in increased biomass and induction of plasmid amplification. Leucine, glycine, and histidine were responsible for increased biomass and leucine starvation in the presence of histidine was implicated in plasmid amplification. Supercoiling of the plasmid was optimized using a dual feeding strategy. As a result of this, a fed-batch fermentation strategy for the production of a 6.9 kb plasmid, pSV\u00df, in Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 was developed. In batch fermentation, a maximum plasmid yield of 39.4 mg/L equivalent to 11.3 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) was achieved with casein hydrolysate limitation. About 90% of plasmid was in the supercoiled (SC) form after 31 hr of fermentation but only remained so for a short period, leading to a very brief window for harvesting cells at scale. Subsequently, a fed-batch fermentation using a dual feeding strategy was employed. A mean maximum plasmid yield of 44 mg/L equivalent to 9.1 mg plasmid/g DCW was achieved. After 25 hr, 90% of plasmid was in the SC form and remained at this level for the remaining 10 hr of the fermentation, allowing adequate time for the harvesting of cells without the loss of supercoiling of product. This study emphasized that optimizing fermentation strategy and identifying the essential nutrients are beneficial for bioprocessing of plasmid DNA for therapeutic applications.",

It has the potential to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke with a portable and inexpensive device. The image reconstruction relies on an accurate forward model of the experimental setup. Because of the relatively small signal in stroke EIT, the finite-element modeling requires meshes of more than 10 million elements. To study the requirements in the forward modeling in EIT and also to reduce the time for experimental image acquisition, it is necessary to reduce the run time of the forward computation. We show the implementation of a parallel forward solver for EIT using the Dune-Fem C++ library and demonstrate its performance on many CPU's of a computer cluster. For a typical EIT application a direct solver was significantly slower and not an alternative to iterative solvers with multigrid preconditioning. With this new solver, we can compute the forward solutions and the Jacobian matrix of a typical EIT application with 30 electrodes on a 15-million element mesh in less than 15 min. This makes it a valuable tool for simulation studies and EIT applications with high precision requirements. It is freely available for download.",

            "Abstract": "Unilateral brain damage can lead to a striking deficit in awareness of stimuli on one side of space called Spatial Neglect. Patient studies show that neglect of the left is markedly more persistent than of the right and that its severity increases under states of low alertness. There have been suggestions that this alertness-spatial awareness link may be detectable in the general population. Here, healthy human volunteers performed an auditory spatial localisation task whilst transitioning in and out of sleep. We show, using independent electroencephalographic measures, that normal drowsiness is linked with a remarkable unidirectional tendency to mislocate left-sided stimuli to the right. The effect may form a useful healthy model of neglect and help in understanding why leftward inattention is disproportionately persistent after brain injury. The results also cast light on marked changes in conscious experience before full sleep onset.",

            "Abstract": "Anomalous microwave emission (AME) is believed to be due to electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. The aim of this paper is a statistical study of the basic properties of AME regions and the environment in which they emit. We used WMAP and Planck maps, combined with ancillary radio and IR data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate AME sources, assembling SEDs for each source using aperture photometry on 1\u00b0-smoothed maps from 0.408\u00e2\u2030 GHz up to 3000 GHz. Each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free, synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (CMB), thermal dust, and spinning dust components. We find that 42 of the 98 sources have significant (>5\u03c3) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 GHz. An analysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emission from ultra-compact H ii regions, using IR colour criteria, reduces the significant AME sample to 27 regions. The spectrum of the AME is consistent with model spectra of spinning dust. Peak frequencies are in the range 20-35 GHz except for the California nebula (NGC 1499), which appears to have a high spinning dust peak frequency of (50 \u00b1 17) GHz. The AME regions tend to be more spatially extended than regions with little or no AME. The AME intensity is strongly correlated with the sub-millimetre/IR flux densities and comparable to previous AME detections in the literature. AME emissivity, defined as the ratio of AME to dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the AME regions. The AME regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 K and an average emissivity index, \u03b2d, of +1.8, while the non-AME regions are typically warmer, at 20-27 K. In agreement with previous studies, the AME emissivity appears to decrease with increasing column density. This supports the idea of AME originating from small grains that are known to be depleted in dense regions, probably due to coagulation onto larger grains. We also find a correlation between the AME emissivity (and to a lesser degree the spinning dust peak frequency) and the intensity of the interstellar radiation field, G0. Modelling of this trend suggests that both radiative and collisional excitation are important for the spinning dust emission. The most significant AME regions tend to have relatively less ionized gas (free-free emission), although this could be a selection effect. The infrared excess, a measure of the heating of dust associated with H ii regions, is typically >4 for AME sources, indicating that the dust is not primarily heated by hot OB stars. The AME regions are associated with known dark nebulae and have higher 12 \u03bcm/25 \u03bcm ratios. The emerging picture is that the bulk of the AME is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase. \u00a9 2014 ESO.",

These mechanisms help ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system by compensating for fluctuations in supply or demand. However, a focus on short-term balancing is sometimes neglected when assessing future capacity expansions with long-term energy system models. Developing heuristics that can simulate short-term system issues is one way of augmenting the functionality of such models. To this end, we present an extended functionality to the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), which captures the impacts of short-term variability of supply and demand on system adequacy and security. Specifically, we modelled the system adequacy as the share of wind energy is increased. Further, we enable the modelling of operating reserve capacities required for balancing services. The dynamics introduced through these model enhancements are presented in an application case study. This application indicates that introducing short-term constraints in long-term energy models may considerably influence the dispatch of power plants, capacity investments, and, ultimately, the policy recommendations derived from such models.",

All rights reserved.Objective: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of the recently introduced Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT) framework for imaging prostate cancer with diffusionweighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: The VERDICT framework is a noninvasive microstructure imaging technique that combines an in-depth diffusionMRI acquisition with amathematicalmodel to estimate andmapmicrostructural tissue parameters such as cell size and density and vascular perfusion. In total, 8 patients underwent 3-TMRI using 9 different b values (100-3000 s/mm2). All patients were imaged before undergoing biopsy. Experiments with VERDICT analyzed DW-MRI data from patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer in areas of cancerous and benign peripheral zone tissue. For comparison,we also fitted commonly used diffusion models such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and the kurtosis model.We also investigated correlations of ADC and kurtosis with VERDICT parameters to gain some biophysical insight into the various parameter values. Results: Eight patients had prostate cancer in the peripheral zone, with Gleason score 3 + 3 (n = 1), 3 + 4 (n = 6), and 4 + 3 (n = 1). TheVERDICTmodel identified a significant increase in the intracellular and vascular volume fraction estimates in cancerous compared with benign peripheral zone, aswell as a significant decrease in the volume of the extracellular-extravascular space (EES) (P = 0.05). This is in agreement with manual segmentation of the biopsies for prostate tissue component analysis, which found proliferation of epithelium, loss of surrounding stroma, and an increase in vasculature. The standard ADC and kurtosis parameters were also significantly different (P = 0.05) between tissue types. There was no significant difference in any of the IVIM parameters (P = 0.11 to 0.29). The VERDICT parametric maps from voxel-by-voxel fitting clearly differentiated cancer from benign regions. Kurtosis and ADC parameters correlated most strongly with VERDICT's intracellular volume fraction but also moderately with the EES and vascular fractions. Conclusions: The VERDICT model distinguished tumor from benign areas, while revealing differences in microstructure descriptors such as cellular, vascular, and EES fractions. The parameters of ADC and kurtosis models also discriminated between cancer and benign regions. However, VERDICT provides more specific information that disentangles the various microstructural features underlying the changes in ADC and kurtosis. These results highlight the clinical potential of the VERDICT framework and motivate the construction of a shorter, clinically viable imaging protocol to enable larger trials leading to widespread translation of the method.",

Brain Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society of Neuropathology.High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may improve the preoperative diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in epilepsy. Quantitative 9.4T MRI was carried out (T1, T2, T2\u2217 and magnetization transfer ratio) on 13 cortical resections, representing pathologically confirmed FCD (five cases) and normal cortex. Quantitative immunohistochemistry for myelination (myelin basic protein/SMI94), neuronal populations [microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), neurofilament (SMI31, SMI32), synaptophysin, NeuN, calbindin], reactive glia (GFAP), microglia (CD68) and blood-brain barrier permeability (albumin) was carried out in 43 regions of interest (ROI) from normal and abnormal white matter and cortex. MRI was spatially aligned and quantitative analysis carried out on corresponding ROI. Line profile analysis (LPA) of intensity gradients through the cortex was carried out on MRI and immunostained sections. An inverse correlation was noted between myelin/SMI94 and T1, T2 (P < 0.005) and T2\u2217 (P < 0.05; Spearman's correlation) and a positive correlation between neuronal MAP2 and T1 (P < 0.005) and T2\u2217 (P < 0.05) over all ROI. Similar pathology-MRI correlations were observed for histologically unremarkable white matter ROI only. LPA showed altered gradient contours in regions of FCD, reflecting abnormal cortical lamination and myelo-architecture, including a preoperatively undetected FCD case. This study demonstrates the ability of quantitative 9.4T MRI to detect subtle differences in neuronal numbers and myelination in histologically normal appearing white matter and LPA in the evaluation of cortical dyslamination. These methods may be translatable to the in vivo detection of mild cortical malformations.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 SPIE.A stable reproducible optical standard source for measuring multimode optical fiber attenuation is required as recent round robin measurements of such fibers at several international companies and national standards organizations showed significant variation when using a source having only the encircled flux in the near field emerging from it defined. The paper presents and compares the far field modal power distributions for (i) 2 km and 3 km step-index multimode Hard Plastic Cladding Fibers, HPCF, (SI-MMF) with 200 \u03bcm silica core diameter, 0.37 numerical aperture (NA) and polymer cladding, (ii) a 10 m silica graded-index multimode fiber (GI-MMF) with 50 \u03bcm core diameter and 0.2 NA, and (ii) a near field Encircled Flux Mode Convertor or \"modcona\". A free space method for measuring the far field using a Lightemitting diode (LED) centered at 850 nm wavelength with 40 nm 10 dB-bandwidth and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is compared with a f-theta multi-element lens based far field pattern (FFP) system. Mandrels of different diameter and different numbers of turns of the fiber around them were used to achieve an equilibrium mode distribution (EMD) for the GI-MMF. The paper defines encircled angular flux (EAF) as the fraction of the total optical power radiating from a multimode optical fiber core within a certain solid angle in the far field. The paper calculates the EAF when the solid angle increases from the far field centroid.",

            "Abstract": "Background Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and a multiple sclerosis (MS)-like illness appear to coexist 50 times more frequently than would be expected by chance. This association of LHON and MS (LMS) raises an important question about whether there could be a common pathophysiological mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Objective The primary aim was to define MRI features of LMS and LHON, and to assess the proportions of individuals displaying features typical of MS. Secondarily, we investigated the effect of gender on the risk of developing white matter lesions in the context of LHON. Methods A blinded standardised review of conventional brain MRIs of 30 patients with MS, 31 patients with LHON and 11 patients with LMS was conducted by three independent experts in the field. MS-like MRI features were assessed. Results All patients with LMS and 26% of patients with LHON had white matter lesions. Of these, all patients with LMS and 25% with LHON were found to have an MRI appearance typical of MS. Female patients with LHON had a signi ficantly greater risk of having white matter lesions consistent with MS compared with male patients (relative risk 8.3). Conclusions A blinded review of conventional brain MRIs shows that patients with LMS have a scan appearance indistinguishable from MS. Mitochondrial dysfunction could be a common pathophysiological pathway in the formation of white matter lesions. There appears to be a strong female in fluence on the radiological appearance as well as clinical development of MS in patients with LHON.",

All rights reserved.Background/aims: Real-life anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy use in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) was assessed in a retrospective, observational study in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, UK and Venezuela. Methods: Medical records of patients with wAMD, who started ranibizumab treatment between 1 January 2009 and 31 August 2009, were evaluated. Data were collected until the end of treatment and/or monitoring or until 31 August 2011. Results: 2227 patients who received \u22651 anti-VEGF injection with a baseline visual acuity assessment and \u22651 postbaseline visual acuity assessment for the treated eye were evaluated. Visual acuity improved until about day 120; thereafter, visual acuity gains were not maintained. Mean change in visual acuity score from baseline to years 1 and 2 was +2.4 and +0.6 letters, respectively. Patients received a mean of 5.0 and 2.2 injections in the first and second year, respectively. There were substantial differences in visual outcomes and injection frequency between countries. More frequent visits and injections were associated with greater improvements in visual acuity. Conclusions: In clinical practice, fewer injections are administered than in clinical trials. Anti-VEGF treatment resulted in an initial improvement in visual acuity; however, this was not maintained over time. Trial registration number: NCT01447043.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.Treatment of critical size bone defects pose a challenge in orthopedics. Stem cell therapy together with cytokines has the potential to improve bone repair as they cause the migration and homing of stem cells to the defect site. However, the engraftment, participation, and recruitment of other cells within the regenerating tissue are important. To enhance stem cell involvement, this study investigated overexpression of stem cells with stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) using an adenovirus. We hypothesized that these engineered cells would effectively increase the migration of native cells to the site of fracture, enhancing bone repair. Before implantation, we showed that SDF-1 secreted by transfected cells increased the migration of nontransfected cells. In a rat defect bone model, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing SDF-1 showed significantly (p=0.003) more new bone formation within the gap and less bone mineral loss at the area adjacent to the defect site during the early bone healing stage. In conclusion, SDF-1 was shown to play an important role in accelerating fracture repair and contributing to bone repair in rat models, by recruiting more host stem cells to the defect site and encouraging osteogenic differentiation and production of bone.",

Here we examine the influence of overt versus covert speech production on lateralization, the relationship between lateralization and behavioural measures of language performance and the strength of lateralization across the subcomponents of language. The present study used functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) to investigate lateralization of phonological and semantic fluency during both overt and covert word generation in right-handed adults. The laterality index (LI) was left lateralized in all conditions, and there was no difference in the strength of LI between overt and covert speech. This supports the validity of using overt speech in fTCD studies, another benefit of which is a reliable measure of speech production.",

To understand changes over the entire life course, it is necessary to combine data from various studies that cover the whole life course. Such combination may be methodologically challenging due to potential differences in study protocols, information available and instruments used to measure the outcome of interest. Motivated by our interest in modelling blood pressure changes over the life course, we propose the use of Bayesian adaptive splines within a hierarchical setting to combine data from several UK-based longitudinal studies where blood pressure measures were taken in different stages of life. Our method allowed us to obtain a realistic estimate of the mean life course trajectory, quantify the variability both within and between studies, and examine overall and study specific effects of relevant risk factors on life course blood pressure changes.",

Immunotherapies aimed at reducing the level of these antibodies might be expected to be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2006 and 2012. Objectives: To assess the effects of immunotherapy for IgM anti-MAG paraprotein-associated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Search methods: On 1 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also checked trials registers and bibliographies, and contacted authors and experts in the field. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving participants of any age treated with any type of immunotherapy for anti-MAG antibody-associated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and of any severity. Our primary outcome measures were numbers of participants improved in disability assessed with either or both of the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (NIS) or the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at six months after randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were: mean improvement in disability, assessed with either the NIS or the mRS, 12 months after randomisation; change in impairment as measured by improvement in the 10-metre walk time, change in a validated linear disability measure such as the Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) at six and 12 months after randomisation, change in subjective clinical scores and electrophysiological parameters at six and 12 months after randomisation; change in serum IgM paraprotein concentration or anti-MAG antibody titre at six months after randomisation; and adverse effects of treatments. Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: We identified eight eligible trials (236 participants), which tested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), interferon alfa-2a, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and steroids, and rituximab. Two trials of IVIg (22 and 11 participants, including 20 with antibodies against MAG), had comparable interventions and outcomes, but both were short-term trials. We also included two trials of rituximab with comparable interventions and outcomes. There were very few clinical or statistically significant benefits of the treatments used on the outcomes predefined for this review, but not all the predefined outcomes were used in every included trial and more responsive outcomes are being developed. A well-performed trial of IVIg, which was at low risk of bias, showed a statistical benefit in terms of improvement in mRS at two weeks and 10-metre walk time at four weeks, but these short-term outcomes are of questionable clinical significance. Cyclophosphamide failed to show any benefit in the single trial's primary outcome, and showed a barely significant benefit in the primary outcome specified here, but some toxic adverse events were identified. Two trials of rituximab (80 participants) have been published, one of which (26 participants) was at high risk of bias. In the meta-analysis, although the data are of low quality, rituximab is beneficial in improving disability scales (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) improved at eight to 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 9.45; 73 participants)) and significantly more participants improve in the global impression of change score (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.71; 70 participants). Other measures did not improve significantly, but wide CIs do not preclude some effect. Reported adverse effects of rituximab were few, and mostly minor. There were few serious adverse events in the other trials. Authors' conclusions: There is inadequate reliable evidence from trials of immunotherapies in anti-MAG paraproteinaemic neuropathy to form an evidence base supporting any particular immunotherapy treatment. IVIg has a statistically but probably not clinically significant benefit in the short term. The meta-analysis of two trials of rituximab provides, however, low-quality evidence of a benefit from this agent. The conclusions of this meta-analysis await confirmation, as one of the two included studies is of very low quality. We require large well-designed randomised trials of at least 12 months' duration to assess existing or novel therapies, preferably employing unified, consistent, well-designed, responsive, and valid outcome measures.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2015.This chapter highlights the key role played by self-control in people's social representations of themselves and of others. Self-control is the ability to exercise restraint over one's emotions, desires and actions. An ethos is a fundamental value within a given culture that displays moral character. Thus the self-control ethos is the guiding value within a culture wherein restraint is regarded as demonstrating moral fortitude. This chapter reiterates and develops the theory, proposed by Joffe and Staerkl\u00e9 (2007) that within western cultures the self-control ethos plays a key role in the social construction of certain groups as inferior, and concomitantly, others as superior. Key developments lie in pinpointing the symbolic power held by groups that represent contravention of multiple aspects of the self-control ethos, as well as the inclusion of the concept of the thema underpinning the social representations of out-groups. The chapter begins by pointing to how mainstream models of social psychology have theorized aspersions concerning out-groups. Following this, a more visceral-emotive model of the content of stereotyping and prejudice is called for. The chapter then proposes an alternative, social representational stance to the content of people's aspersions regarding out-groups. Having suggested the centrality of the self-control ethos in shaping social representations, its instantiation in relation to body, mind and destiny is elaborated. Finally, the chapter discusses how the self-control ethos functions to perpetuate the exclusion and derogation of certain groups, on the one hand, and to buttress the superiority of dominant groups and maintain the social status quo, on the other. The nature of stereotype content in existing theories of intergroup relations The content of thought underpinning commonly derogated out-groups, and thus stereotyping and prejudice, has not attracted sufficient attention in the social sciences. The more mainstream theories of stereotypes regarding out-groups have tended to theorize the process of stereotyping in the hope that the contents of people's aspersions regarding others will take care of themselves (Duveen, 2001b). Tajfel (1969), for example, introduced the idea that the psychological process underpinning stereotypical judgement and prejudice is categorization.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether regulatory T cells (Treg) can control B cell function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and if not to explore the basis for this defect.Methods: Suppression of B cell responses by Treg was analysed in vitro by flow cytometry and ELISA using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 65 patients with RA and 41 sex-matched and aged-matched healthy volunteers. Blocking and agonistic antibodies were used to define the role of Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cell regulation.Results: Treg failed to restrain B cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine and antibody production in the presence of responder T cells in RA patients. This lack of suppression was not only caused by impaired Treg function but was also due to B cell resistance to regulation. In healthy donors, control by Treg was associated with increased B cell death and relied upon Fas-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, RA B cells had reduced Fas expression compared with their healthy counterparts and were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis.Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that Treg are unable to limit B cell responses in RA. This appears to be primarily due to B cell resistance to suppression, but Treg defects also contribute to this failure of regulation. Our data identify the Fas pathway as a novel target for Treg-mediated suppression of B cells and highlight a potential therapeutic approach to restore control of B cells by Treg in RA patients.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 European Society of Cardiology.Background With the aging of the population living with HIV, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing. There is a need to further facilitate the identification of persons at elevated risk in routine practice. Methods and results Prospective information was collected on 32,663 HIV-positive persons from 20 countries in Europe and Australia, who were free of CVD at entry into the Data-collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study. Cox regression models (full and reduced) were developed that predict the risk of a global CVD endpoint. The predictive performance of the D:A:D models were compared with a recent CVD prediction model from the Framingham study, which was assessed recalibrated to the D:A:D dataset. A total of 1010 CVD events occurred during 186,364.5 person-years. The full D:A:D CVD prediction model included age, gender, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, family history of CVD, diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, CD4 lymphocyte count, cumulative exposure to protease- and nucleoside reverse transcriptase-inhibitors, and current use of abacavir. A reduced model omitted antiretroviral therapies. The D:A:D models statistically significantly predicted risk more accurately than the recalibrated Framingham model (Harrell's c-statistic of 0.791, 0.783 and 0.766 for the D:A:D full, D:A:D reduced, and Framingham models respectively; p < 0.001). The D:A:D models also more accurately predicted five-year CVD-risk for key prognostic subgroups. Conclusions An updated, easily recalibrated, global CVD-risk equation tailored to HIV-positive persons was developed using routinely collected CVD risk parameters and incorporating markers on immune function (CD4 lymphocyte count), and exposure to antiretroviral therapies. The estimated CVD risk can be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care.",

This may affect the integrity of the adjuvant, alter its interaction with the drug substance or change the physical characteristics of the drug product. In this study, a solid-liquid interfacial shear device was used to investigate the shear response of aluminum phosphate adjuvant alone and two adjuvant containing vaccine drug products (DP1 and DP2). The relationship between the shear sensitivity of each and its resuspension properties was determined. Changes in the particle dimensions of the bulk adjuvant were minimal at shear strain rates of 10,900 s-1. However, at 25,500 s-1, the median particle diameter was reduced from 6.2 to 3.5 \u03bcm and was marked by the presence of sub-micron fines. A formulation without drug substance and DP2 produced similar shear responses but with less impact on particle diameter. The behavior of DP1 was less predictable. Sheared DP1 was characterized by prolonged sedimentation because of the presence of fine particulates and required in excess of 300 rotations to resuspend after extended storage. The study confirms that the solid-liquid interfacial shear device may be applied to understand product shear sensitivity associated with vaccine manufacturing.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2015.The nearby Chamaeleon clouds have been observed in \u03b3 rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and in thermal dust emission by Planck and IRAS. Cosmic rays and large dust grains, if smoothly mixed with gas, can jointly serve with the Hi and 12CO radio data to (i) map the hydrogen column densities, NH, in the different gas phases, in particular at the dark neutral medium (DNM) transition between the Hi-bright and CO-bright media; (ii) constrain the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, XCO; and (iii) probe the dust properties per gas nucleon in each phase and map their spatial variations across the clouds. We have separated clouds at local, intermediate, and Galactic velocities in Hi and 12CO line emission to model in parallel the \u03b3-ray intensity recorded between 0.4 and 100 GeV; the dust optical depth at 353 GHz, \u03c4353; the thermal radiance of the large grains; and an estimate of the dust extinction, AVQ, empirically corrected for the starlight intensity. The dust and \u03b3-ray models have been coupled to account for the DNM gas. The consistent \u03b3-ray emissivity spectra recorded in the different phases confirm that the GeV-TeV cosmic rays probed by the LAT uniformly permeate all gas phases up to the 12CO cores. The dust and cosmic rays both reveal large amounts of DNM gas, with comparable spatial distributions and twice as much mass as in the CO-bright clouds. We give constraints on the Hi-DNM-CO transitions for five separate clouds. CO-dark H2 dominates the molecular columns up to AV \u2243 0.9 and its mass often exceeds the one-third of the molecular mass expected by theory. The corrected AVQ extinction largely provides the best fit to the total gas traced by the \u03b3 rays. Nevertheless, we find evidence for a marked rise in AVQ/NH with increasing NH and molecular fraction, and with decreasing dust temperature. The rise in \u03c4353/NH is even steeper. We observe variations of lesser amplitude and orderliness for the specific power of the grains, except for a coherent decline by half in the CO cores. This combined information suggests grain evolution. We provide average values for the dust properties per gas nucleon in the different phases. The \u03b3 rays and dust radiance yield consistent XCO estimates near 0.7 \u00d7 1020cm-2K-1km-1s. The AVQ and \u03c4353 tracers yield biased values because of the large rise in grain opacity in the CO clouds. These results clarify a recurrent disparity in the \u03b3-ray versus dust calibration of XCO, but they confirm the factor of 2 difference found between the XCO estimates in nearby clouds and in the neighbouring spiral arms.",

All rights reserved.To examine the cerebellar contribution to human spatial navigation we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and virtual reality. Our findings show that the sensory-motor requirements of navigation induce activity in cerebellar lobules and cortical areas known to be involved in the motor loop and vestibular processing. By contrast, cognitive aspects of navigation mainly induce activity in a different cerebellar lobule (VIIA Crus I). Our results demonstrate a functional link between cerebellum and hippocampus in humans and identify specific functional circuits linking lobule VIIA Crus I of the cerebellum to medial parietal, medial prefrontal, and hippocampal cortices in nonmotor aspects of navigation. They further suggest that Crus I belongs to 2 nonmotor loops, involved in different strategies: placebased navigation is supported by coherent activity between left cerebellar lobule VIIA Crus I and medial parietal cortex along with right hippocampus activity, while sequence-based navigation is supported by coherent activity between right lobule VIIA Crus I, medial prefrontal cortex, and left hippocampus. These results highlight the prominent role of the human cerebellum in both motor and cognitive aspects of navigation, and specify the cortico-cerebellar circuits by which it acts depending on the requirements of the task.",

This article reports how we drew on the meta-narrative approach in a review that examined the changing and contested nature of \u2018community\u2019 as understood across disciplines and research traditions. We discuss the challenges that arose in our review and the strengths and limitations of our approach. We conclude that the meta-narrative approach provides a useful framework for making sense of the multiple and changing conceptualisations of community while accounting for historical context.

Methods: Content analysis of the ten most widely circulated print/digital news sources in the UK. Results: Seventy-nine articles were identified focusing on NIPT for Down syndrome (n=67) including single gene disorders (n=5), whole genome sequencing (n=8), NIPT technology (n=2), Rhesus D (n=1) and fetal sex determination (n=1). The majority (63%) were in 'serious' papers. Test attributes were frequently cited (100%), in particular that NIPT is a blood test (89%) and avoids risk of miscarriage (56%). The main psychosocial benefit reported was increased time for decision-making (15%). Concerns were discussed less frequently than benefits (39%), with increase in termination rates the main concern raised (23%). The majority of headlines (52%) projected a positive frame towards NIPT. Regarding overall framing of articles, over two thirds (68%) presented benefits and concerns or limitations; however, only a third (35%) were considered 'balanced'. Conclusion: Positive reporting of NIPT in the UK news media reflects the publics' broadly optimistic view towards genomic technology and prenatal testing. Health professionals should be aware that women may have incomplete information or misunderstandings about NIPT. Pre-test counselling to ensure informed decision-making is therefore important.",

Hence the need for better characterization of the underlying mechanisms. The processes by which individuals decide to attribute physical effort to obtain rewards might be particularly relevant to relate to apathy traits. Here, we designed two paradigms to assess individual differences in physical effort production and effort-based decision-making and their relation to apathy in healthy people. Apathy scores were measured using a modified version of the Lille Apathy Rating Scale, suitable for use in a non-clinical population.In the first study, apathy scores were correlated with the degree to which stake (reward on offer) and difficulty level impacts on physical effort production. Individuals with relatively high apathy traits showed an increased modulation of effort while more motivated individuals generally exerted greater force across different levels of stake. To clarify the underlying mechanisms for this behavior, we designed a second task that allows independent titration of stake and effort levels for which subjects are willing to engage in an effortful response to obtain a reward. Our results suggest that apathy traits in the normal population are related to the way reward subjectively affects the estimation of effort costs, and more particularly manifest as decreased willingness to exert effort when rewards are small, or below threshold. The tasks we introduce here may provide useful tools to further investigate apathy in clinical populations.",

By focusing on the expected real interest rate, previous studies provide some empirical support for explanations of the Great Depression that are not exclusively monetary in nature. However, these studies did not consider the context and the market microstructures from which the data was sourced. Our analysis suggests that it is more likely that agricultural commodity markets adjusted to deflationary expectations by the end of 1930. Evidence from commodities futures markets, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, therefore should not be used to critique the Keynesian challenge to the classical monetarist explanation of the Great Depression.",

BJU International \u00a9 2014 BJU International.Objective To assess the long-term efficacy of polydimethylsiloxane (Macroplastique\u00ae) injection (MPI) in the treatment of Mitrofanoff leakage secondary to valve incompetence. Patients and Methods Between 1995 and 2012, the records of 24 consecutive patients who underwent MPI for Mitrofanoff urinary leakage after continent cutaneous urinary diversion (CCUD) surgery were examined. All patients had a valve deemed of sufficient length (>2 cm) to attempt Macroplastique coaptation. Treatment outcomes were divided into three categories based on physician assessment: success (dry), partial success (>50% reduction in incontinence pads) and failure. Success rates were assessed according to the type of reservoir and conduit channel. Results The mean (range) follow-up was 30 (6-96) months. One patient had initial difficulty catheterising, and subsequently required major revision surgery. In all, 12 patients (50%) failed the treatment and subsequently underwent operative revision to the channel. Three patients (12.5%) achieved complete success; one patient had an appendix channel through native bladder and the remaining two had Monti channels through colon. Nine patients (37.5%) had partial success; success rates were higher with appendix channels (four of six) and colonic reservoirs (six of seven) when compared with Monti channels (eight of 18, 44%) and ileal reservoirs (zero of two). Five of the nine patients with partial success eventually required further surgical revision for deteriorating continence at a mean (range) of 41 (14-96) months, whilst the other four have maintained sufficient continence with MPI alone. Conclusion Macroplastique bulking cured only 12.5% patients, but leakage was substantially improved in a further 37.5% allowing major surgery to be avoided or postponed in one half of the cohort. Appendix Mitrofanoffs do better than the Monti Mitrofanoff, with channels through colonic segments generally doing better than those through ileal bladders. MPI should be considered as a less invasive alternative to avoid or delay major reconstructive surgery.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 SAGE Publications.Rain impact energy harvesting using piezoelectric energy harvester has gained much attention recently. However, previous works have only considered the effect of single water droplet. In the case of raindrop, water would accumulate on the surface of the energy harvester and form a shallow water layer. This article models the dynamics of a piezoelectric beam, served as a raindrop energy harvester, subjected to water droplet impact with water layer formed on the surface. The impact of water droplet on the tip of the energy harvester is modelled as an impulsive force, and the water layer on the surface of the energy harvester is modelled as an added mass to the energy harvester. An attempt to model the force generated by the water ripple as a distributed load on the piezoelectric beam is presented. Numerical studies have been conducted based upon the proposed mathematical model verified by experimental results. The results showed that the presence of the water layer affects the output voltage and the dominant frequency of the energy harvester. It reveals that the effect of water (or rain) accumulation on the piezoelectric surface should be considered in deriving an optimal operating condition of such energy harvester.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2016.Context. Thanks to the large collecting area (3 \u00d7 \u223c1500 cm2 at 1.5 keV) and wide field of view (30\u2032 across in full field mode) of the X-ray cameras on board the European Space Agency X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, each individual pointing can result in the detection of up to several hundred X-ray sources, most of which are newly discovered objects. Since XMM-Newton has now been in orbit for more than 15 yr, hundreds of thousands of sources have been detected. Aims. Recently, many improvements in the XMM-Newton data reduction algorithms have been made. These include enhanced source characterisation and reduced spurious source detections, refined astrometric precision of sources, greater net sensitivity for source detection, and the extraction of spectra and time series for fainter sources, both with better signal-to-noise. Thanks to these enhancements, the quality of the catalogue products has been much improved over earlier catalogues. Furthermore, almost 50% more observations are in the public domain compared to 2XMMi-DR3, allowing the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre to produce a much larger and better quality X-ray source catalogue. Methods. The XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre has developed a pipeline to reduce the XMM-Newton data automatically. Using the latest version of this pipeline, along with better calibration, a new version of the catalogue has been produced, using XMM-Newton X-ray observations made public on or before 2013 December 31. Manual screening of all of the X-ray detections ensures the highest data quality. This catalogue is known as 3XMM. Results. In the latest release of the 3XMM catalogue, 3XMM-DR5, there are 565 962 X-ray detections comprising 396 910 unique X-ray sources. Spectra and lightcurves are provided for the 133 000 brightest sources. For all detections, the positions on the sky, a measure of the quality of the detection, and an evaluation of the X-ray variability is provided, along with the fluxes and count rates in 7 X-ray energy bands, the total 0.2-12 keV band counts, and four hardness ratios. With the aim of identifying the detections, a cross correlation with 228 catalogues of sources detected in all wavebands is also provided for each X-ray detection. Conclusions. 3XMM-DR5 is the largest X-ray source catalogue ever produced. Thanks to the large array of data products associated with each detection and each source, it is an excellent resource for finding new and extreme objects.",

KGaA, Weinheim.Purpose: We have previously demonstrated associations between the urinary proteome profile and coronary artery disease (CAD) in cross-sectional studies. Here, we evaluate the potential of a urinary proteomic panel as a predictor of CAD in the hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HACVD) substudy population of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial study. Experimental design: Thirty-seven cases with primary CAD endpoint were matched for sex and age to controls who had not reached a CAD endpoint during the study. Spot urine samples were analyzed using CE coupled to Micro-TOF MS. A previously developed 238-marker CE-MS model for diagnosis of CAD (CAD238) was assessed for its predictive potential. Results: Sixty urine samples (32 cases; 28 controls; 88% male, mean age 64 \u00b1 5 years) were analyzed. There was a trend toward healthier values in controls for the CAD model classifier (-0.432 \u00b1 0.326 versus -0.587 \u00b1 0.297, p = 0.170), and the CAD model showed statistical significance on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis p = 0.021. We found 190 individual markers out of 1501 urinary peptides that separated cases and controls (AUC >0.6). Of these, 25 peptides were also components of CAD238. Conclusion and clinical relevance: A urinary proteome panel originally developed in a cross-sectional study predicts CAD endpoints independent of age and sex in a well-controlled prospective study.",

A Brownian particle moving in the random optical potential associated to a speckle pattern, i.e., a complex interference pattern generated by the scattering of coherent light by a random medium, provides an ideal model system to study such phenomena. Here, we derive a theory for the motion of a Brownian particle in a speckle field and, in particular, we identify its universal characteristic timescale. Based on this theoretical insight, we show how speckle light fields can be used to control the anomalous diffusion of a Brownian particle and to perform some basic optical manipulation tasks such as guiding and sorting. Our results might broaden the perspectives of optical manipulation for real-life applications.",

In this study we tested for association between telomere length and methylated cytosine levels. Measurements of mean telomere length and DNA methylation at >450,000 CpG sites were obtained for both blood (N = 24) and EBV-transformed cell-line (N = 36) DNA samples from men aged 44-45 years. We identified 65 gene promoters enriched for CpG sites at which methylation levels are associated with leukocyte telomere length, and 36 gene promoters enriched for CpG sites at which methylation levels are associated with telomere length in DNA from EBV-transformed cell-lines. We observed significant enrichment of positively associated methylated CpG sites in subtelomeric loci (within 4\u00e2 \u20ac...Mb of the telomere) (P < 0.01), and also at loci in imprinted regions (P < 0.001). Our results pave the way for further investigations to help elucidate the relationships between telomere length, DNA methylation and gene expression in health and disease.",

            "Abstract": "We provide a best-fit curve to 1849 strontium isotope data for the period 0 to 206 Ma using the LOcally-WEighted regression Scatterplot Smoother (LOWESS) method. This is a robust, nonparametric modern regression technique. Since it does not yield an explicit mathematical equation relating 87Sr/86Sr to time, a look-up table to determine numeric age has been generated in steps of 1 \u00d7 10-6 in 87Sr/86Sr. The calibration uses the timescales of Shackleton and coworkers for 0-7 Ma; Cande and Kent for 7-72 Ma; Obradovich for 72-95 Ma and Gradstein and coworkers for >95 Ma. The look-up table includes 95% confidence intervals on the predictions of numeric age. When using this table, the uncertainty on the 87Sr/86Sr of the sample whose age is sought must be added to that inherent in the LOWESS regression. We show how to determine the uncertainty in 87Sr/86, i.e., how best to obtain the 95% confidence bounds on a single measurement of 87Sr/86 for a sample, and on the mean 87Sr/86 value for 2 or more replicate measurements of 87Sr/86 in the sample; these confidence intervals reflect analytical-system reproducibility for routine samples (as opposed to that of standard control materials, e.g., NIST 987) and are necessary to establish the final upper and lower bounds on predicted numeric age.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.In the mammalian inner ear, bicellular and tricellular tight junctions (tTJs) seal the paracellular space between epithelial cells. Tricellulin and immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain containing receptor 1 (ILDR1, also referred to as angulin-2) localize to tTJs of the sensory and non-sensory epithelia in the organ of Corti and vestibular end organs. Recessive mutations of TRIC (DFNB49) encoding tricellulin and ILDR1 (DFNB42) cause human nonsyndromic deafness. However, the pathophysiology of DFNB42 deafness remains unknown. ILDR1 was recently reported to be a lipoprotein receptor mediating the secretion of the fat-stimulated cholecystokinin (CCK) hormone in the small intestine, while ILDR1 in EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro was shown to recruit tricellulin to tTJs. Here we show that two different mouse Ildr1 mutant alleles have early-onset severe deafness associated with a rapid degeneration of cochlear hair cells (HCs) but have a normal endocochlear potential. ILDR1 is not required for recruitment of tricellulin to tTJs in the cochlea in vivo; however, tricellulin becomes mislocalized in the inner ear sensory epithelia of ILDR1 null mice after the first postnatal week. As revealed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, ILDR1 contributes to the ultrastructure of inner ear tTJs. Taken together, our data provide insight into the pathophysiology of human DFNB42 deafness and demonstrate that ILDR1 is crucial for normal hearing by maintaining the structural and functional integrity of tTJs, which are critical for the survival of auditory neurosensory HCs.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Taylor & Francis.Police investigations involve determining whether a crime has been committed, and if so what type of crime, who has committed it and whether there is the evidence to charge the perpetrators. Drawing on fieldwork in Delhi and Mumbai, this paper explores how police investigations unfolded in the specific context of women's deaths by burning in India. In particular, it focuses on the use of discretion despite its denial by those exercising it. In India, there are distinctive statutes relating to women's suspicious deaths, reflecting the widespread expectation that the bride's family will pay a dowry to the groom's family and the tensions to which this may on occasion give rise in the early years of a marriage. Often, there are conflicting claims influencing how the woman's death is classified. These in turn affect police investigation. The nature and direction of police discretion in investigating women's deaths by burning reflect in part the unique nature of the legislation and the particular sensitivities in relation to these types of death. They also highlight processes that are liable to be at work in any crime investigation. It was found that police officers exercised unacknowledged discretion at seven specific points in the investigative process, with potentially significant consequences for the achievement of just outcomes: first response, recording the victim's \u2018dying declaration\u2019, inquest, registering of the \u2018First Information Report\u2019, collecting evidence, arrest and framing of the charges.",

However, little research has focused on the role of explainers in other cultural contexts. This study explored interactions between visitors and museum explainers within the setting of Thailand. Two questionnaires were distributed to 600 visitors and 41 museum explainers. The results demonstrated both potential similarities and differences with Western contexts. Explainers appeared to prefer didactic approaches, focussing on factual knowledge rather than encouraging deep learning. Two-way communication, however, appeared to be enhanced by the use of a \u2018pseudo-sibling relationship\u2019 by explainers. Traditional Thai social reserve was reduced through such approaches, with visitors taking on active learning roles. These findings have implications for training museum explainers in non-Western cultures, as well as museum communication practice more generally.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The operating range of lean-burn spark-ignition (SI) engines is limited by the cycle-to-cycle variability of the fuel concentration at or near the spark plug at ignition timing. An experimental investigation was undertaken to measure the temporal and spatial distribution of hydrocarbon (HC) concentration in a spark-ignition engine, using the infrared (IR) laser absorption at 3392 nm. The purposes were to establish whether there is a correlation between time-resolved HC measurements for a range of global air-to-fuel (A/F) ratios (A/F = 15.5-23) with the strength of the firing stroke and to establish how this varies with fuel port-injection strategies against either open (injection timing 30\u00b0 crank angle (CA) after intake top dead center) or closed-valves (injection timing 180\u00b0CA after intake top dead center), respectively resulting in stratified and near-homogeneous charge distributions. The results showed that IR line-of-sight (LOS) averaged A/F ratio measurements yielded a good agreement with the global A/F ratio readings obtained by the linear air-to-fuel (LAF) zirconia-based sensor. Furthermore, the cyclic variability of the measurements of the fuel concentration increased with increasing A/F ratio. At A/F = 23, closed-valve injection strategy resulted in small spatial stratification of the fuel charge with an ensemble-averaged correlation coefficient of fluctuations of the IR LOS A/F ratios with fluctuations of peak in-cylinder pressure of 0.37. For open-valve injection strategy, which resulted in axial fuel mixture charge-stratification but no radial charge-stratification, a maximum correlation coefficient of the IR LOS A/F ratios with fluctuations of peak pressure of 0.34 was measured (at the measurement location closest to the spark). This correlation was reduced to 0.17 at locations furthest from the spark plug. Finally, results showed that at A/F = 23, fuel stratification can be used to control lean-burn SI combustion, while at A/F = 15.5, no significant difference was observed between the two injection timings. The consequences of these findings on the fuel distribution in the pentroof and the control of the lean limits of SI engines are discussed.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Recent studies have shown that place cells in the hippocampus possess firing fields that repeat in physically similar, parallel environments. These results imply that it should be difficult for animals to distinguish parallel environments at a behavioral level. To test this, we trained rats on a novel odor-location task in an environment with four parallel compartments which had previously been shown to yield place field repetition. A second group of animals was trained on the same task, but with the compartments arranged in different directions, an arrangement we hypothesised would yield less place field repetition. Learning of the odor-location task in the parallel compartments was significantly impaired relative to learning in the radially arranged compartments. Fewer animals acquired the full discrimination in the parallel compartments compared to those trained in the radial compartments, and the former also required many more sessions to reach criterion compared to the latter. To confirm that the arrangement of compartments yielded differences in place cell repetition, in a separate group of animals we recorded from CA1 place cells in both environments. We found that CA1 place cells exhibited repeated fields across four parallel local compartments, but did not do so when the same compartments were arranged radially. To confirm that the differences in place field repetition across the parallel and radial compartments depended on their angular arrangement, and not incidental differences in access to an extra-maze visual landmark, we repeated the recordings in a second set of rats in the absence of the orientation landmark. We found, once again, that place fields showed repetition in parallel compartments, and did not do so in radially arranged compartments. Thus place field repetition, or lack thereof, in these compartments was not dependent on extra-maze cues. Together, these results imply that place field repetition constrains spatial learning.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.Background & Aims: Portal hypertension is characterized by reduced hepatic eNOS activity. Asymmetric-dimethylarginine (ADMA), an eNOS inhibitor, is elevated in cirrhosis and correlates with the severity of portal hypertension. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) is the key enzyme metabolizing hepatic ADMA. This study characterized DDAH-1 in cirrhosis, and explored hepatic DDAH-1 reconstitution through farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonism and DDAH-1 gene therapy. Methods: DDAH-1 immunohistochemistry was conducted on human cirrhosis and healthy liver tissue. Subsequently, shamoperated or bile-duct-ligated (BDL) cirrhosis rats were treated with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OA, 5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 days. Further, animals underwent hydrodynamic injection with DDAH-1-expressing plasmid or saline control, which resulted in the following groups: sham + saline, BDL + saline, BDL + DDAH-1-plasmid. Portal pressure (PP) measurements were performed. Plasma ALT was measured by COBAS INTEGRA, DDAH-1 expression by qPCR and Western blot, eNOS activity by radiometric assay. Results: Immunohistochemistry and Western-blotting confirmed hepatic DDAH-1 was restricted to hepatocytes, and expression decreased significantly in cirrhosis. In BDL rats, reduced DDAH- 1 expression was associated with elevated hepatic ADMA, reduced eNOS activity and high PP. OA treatment significantly increased DDAH-1 expression, reduced hepatic tissue ADMA, and increased liver NO generation. PP was significantly reduced in BDL + OA vs. BDL + vehicle (8 \u00b1 1 vs. 13.5 \u00b1 0.6 mmHg; p <0.01) with no change in the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Similarly, DDAH-1 hydrodynamic injection significantly increased hepatic DDAH-1 gene and protein expression, and significantly reduced PP in BDL + DDAH-1 vs. BDL + saline (p <0.01). Conclusions: This study demonstrates DDAH-1 is a specific molecular target for portal pressure reduction, through actions on ADMA-mediated regulation of eNOS activity. Our data support translational studies, targeting DDAH-1 in cirrhosis and portal hypertension.",

Tonal reduction refers to the phenomenon of the tones of a disyllabic unit being contracted into a monosyllabic unit. An experiment was carried out in which six native Taiwan Mandarin male speakers produced sentences containing disyllabic compound words /ma/+/ma/ with varying tonal combinations at different speech rates. Analyses indicated that increasing time pressure led to severe tonal reductions. Articulatory effort, measured by the slope of F0 peak velocity of unidirectional movement over F0 movement amplitude, is insufficient to compensate for duration-dependent undershoot (in particular, when time pressure exceeds certain thresholds). Mechanisms of tonal reduction were further examined by comparing F0 velocity profiles against the Edge-in model, a rule-based phonological model. Results showed that the residual tonal variants in contracted syllables are gradient rather than categorical\u2014as duration is shortened, the movement towards the desired targets is gradually curtailed.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The British Psychological Society.Objective Psychological morbidity, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is common in survivors of intensive care. Intrusive memories of trauma are important symptoms of PTSD. Research has not established which aspects of intensive care are most traumatizing; invasive medical procedures, fear of dying from life-threatening illness or injury, or effects of psychoactive drugs, including hallucinations and delusions. Our study aimed to investigate the roots of post-intensive care trauma by interviewing survivors with symptoms of PTSD. Were their intrusive memories primarily of real events or hallucinations and delusions from intensive care? Design Interview study as part of a mixed-methods investigation of psychological outcomes post-intensive care. Methods We used purposive sampling to identify patients with intrusive memories of intensive care unit. Detailed interviews were conducted to investigate the nature and content of post-intensive care memories. Intrusive memories were categorized as factual, hallucinatory/delusional, or uncertain. Results Thematic saturation was achieved after 17 interviews. Approximately 70% (12/17) of patients had hallucinatory/delusional intrusive memories of intensive care, while 12% (2/17) had factual but no hallucinatory/delusional memories; 18% (3) were uncertain whether memories were factual or hallucinatory/delusional. Further analysis suggested that 88% of all patients had hallucinatory/delusional intrusive memories. The content of intrusive memories commonly merged realistic events (involving intensive care staff, environment, medical procedures and unpleasant physical experiences) with delusions and frightening hallucinations. Conclusions We found that patients in this in-depth study were more traumatized by frightening hallucinations/delusions than real events, suggesting they may have post-psychosis PTSD, rather than classic PTSD. Interventions are needed to diagnose and treat intensive care hallucinations/delusions, or minimize effects, to prevent PTSD.",

The estimation of its parameters entails unconstrained maximization of a concave and non-differentiable function over the real space. In this note, we describe a maximization algorithm based on the gradient of the log-likelihood that generates a finite sequence of parameter values along which the likelihood increases. The algorithm can be applied to the estimation of mixed-effects quantile regression, Laplace regression with censored data, and other models based on Laplace likelihood.

The aim was to determine to what extent non-experts understood BDP and to what extent they held erroneous beliefs about specific aspects of the causes and cures for the disorder.Method: A convenience sample of 102 participants completed a vignette-identification task that required them to answer open-ended questions about hypothetical people with four psychological problems, one of which was BPD and a 50-item questionnaire divided into three sections about BDP.Results: Analysis of the vignette identification task revealed very low rates of recognition for BPD, with participants significantly more likely to identify depression, schizophrenia or psychopathy. Participants\u2019 generally favoured psychological and sociological treatments, as well as rating early trauma and stress as possible causes of the symptoms of the person described in the BDP vignette.

All rights reserved.Spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres has become a well established method for the characterization of extrasolar planets. We here present a novel inverse retrieval code for exoplanetary atmospheres. \u03a4-REx(Tau Retrieval for Exoplanets) is a line-by-line radiative transfer fully Bayesian retrieval framework. \u03a4-REx includes the following features:(1) the optimized use of molecular line lists from the ExoMol project; (2) an unbiased atmospheric composition prior selection, through custom built pattern recognition software; (3) the use of two independent algorithms to fully sample the Bayesian likelihood space: nested sampling as well as a more classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach; (4) iterative Bayesian parameter and model selection using the full Bayesian Evidence as well as the Savage-Dickey Ratio for nested models; and (5) the ability to fully map very large parameter spaces through optimal code parallelization and scalability to cluster computing. In this publication we outline the \u03a4-REx framework and demonstrate, using a theoretical hot-Jupiter transmission spectrum, the parameter retrieval and model selection. We investigate the impact of signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution on the retrievability of individual model parameters, both in terms of error bars on the temperature and molecular mixing ratios as well as its effect on the model's global Bayesian evidence.",

In this study we investigated whether physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with self-rated health among adolescents aged 16 years. Methods: The study sample comprised 7,063 adolescents from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC 1986) who responded to a postal questionnaire in 2001 to 2002. Self-rated health was measured by a single-item question, while physical activity was evaluated by a set of questions concerning the intensity and volume of physical activity outside school hours. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with a submaximal cycle ergometer test. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for good self-rated health were obtained from multinomial logistic regression. Results: High levels of physical activity (boys: OR 5.50, 95% CI 3.16 to 9.58; girls: OR 4.25, 95% CI 2.37 to 7.61) and cardiorespiratory fitness (boys: OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.24; girls: OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.66) were associated with very good self-rated health in adolescents. Conclusions: High levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are positively associated with adolescents' self-rated health. Public health promotion activities that foster physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may benefit young people's overall health and well-being.",

However, there is a worldwide shortage of population data to inform understanding of non-fatal injury burden. An improved understanding of the pattern of recovery following trauma is needed to better estimate the burden of injury, guide provision of rehabilitation services and care to injured people, and inform guidelines for the monitoring and evaluation of disability outcomes. Objective To provide a comprehensive overview of patient outcomes and experiences in the first 5 years after serious injury. Design This is a population-based, nested prospective cohort study using quantitative data methods, supplemented by a qualitative study of a seriously injured participant sample. Participants All 2547 paediatric and adult major trauma patients captured by the Victorian State Trauma Registry with a date of injury from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 who survived to hospital discharge and did not opt-off from the registry. Analysis To analyse the quantitative data and identify factors that predict poor or good outcome, whether there is change over time, differences in rates of recovery and change between key participant subgroups, multilevel mixed effects regression models will be fitted. To analyse the qualitative data, thematic analysis will be used to identify important themes and the relationships between themes. Contribution to the field The results of this project have the potential to inform clinical decisions and public health policy, which can reduce the burden of non-fatal injury and improve the lives of people living with the consequences of severe injury.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015, American College of Rheumatology.Objective. There are currently no validated outcome measures to assess calcinosis severity in systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). We sought to develop and validate a novel radiographic scoring system for calcinosis affecting the hands of SSc patients for potential use in future clinical trials. Methods. Following a 1-hour teleconference training session, 12 investigators (8 rheumatologists, 1 dermatologist, and 3 radiologists) scored 12 hand radiographs in random order using 2 scoring systems (termed \"simple\" and \"complex\") and re-scored 2 randomly assigned radiographs after a minimum of 24 hours. Interrater and intrarater reliability were assessed using a weighted kappa coefficient for the simple system (\u03ba), and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the complex system (ICC <0.4 for poor, 0.4-0.7 for moderate, and >0.7 for excellent). Results. Mean time to complete the complex scoring system was significantly longer than the simple scoring system (4.0 versus 0.4 minutes; P < 0.0001). Overall interrater reliability for the simple scoring system was poor (\u03ba = 0.39, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.1-0.52) but improved if dichotomized as mild/moderate versus severe (\u03ba = 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.7). Interrater reliability was excellent for the complex scoring system (ICC 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.92). Intrarater reliability was moderate for the simple scoring system (\u03ba = 0.67, 95% CI 0.37-0.96) but almost perfect for the complex scoring system (ICC 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97). Conclusion. We developed a novel radiographic scoring system that accounts for the area coverage, density, and anatomic location of calcinosis affecting the hands in patients with SSc. This scoring system is feasible with excellent reliability and should undergo further validation testing for use in clinical trials.",

The publication begins with chapters on conventional procedures, i.e. trabeculectomy (still the gold standard), deep sclerectomy, and glaucoma drainage device implantation explicitly focusing on postoperative management. The role of the ocular surface in glaucoma surgery and the issue of wound healing and its modulation through antimetabolites are further discussed. In the second part, the attention shifts to new techniques which still have a marginal role, but are promising for particular indications. In the last part, the greatest challenges of glaucoma surgery such as the surgical approach to angle closure, concomitant glaucoma and cataract as well as pediatric glaucoma are discussed in detail. Finally, the last chapter is dedicated to cyclodestructive techniques. This volume is recommended to glaucoma surgeons and glaucoma specialists seeking information on the best therapy for their patients, but also to general ophthalmologists who refer their patients for surgery or follow them up afterwards.",

Consistency within these observables is crucial in order to advance towards a science of cities. Bettencourt et al. have proposed that many of these urban measures can be predicted through universal scaling laws. We develop a framework to consistently define cities, using commuting to work and population density thresholds, and construct thousands of realizations of systems of cities with different boundaries for England and Wales. These serve as a laboratory for the scaling analysis of a large set of urban indicators. The analysis shows that population size alone does not provide us enough information to describe or predict the state of a city as previously proposed, indicating that the expected scaling laws are not corroborated. We found that most urban indicators scale linearly with city size, regardless of the definition of the urban boundaries. However, when nonlinear correlations are present, the exponent fluctuates considerably.",

In order to solve such problems, the boundary element method (BEM) can be applied. The advantage compared to domain-discretisation-based methods such as finite element methods is that only a discretisation of the boundary is necessary, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns. Yet, BEM formulations are much more difficult to implement than finite element methods. In this article, we present BEM++, a novel open-source library for the solution of boundary integral equations for Laplace, Helmholtz and Maxwell problems in three space dimensions. BEM++ is a C++ library with Python bindings for all important features, making it possible to integrate the library into other C++ projects or to use it directly via Python scripts. The internal structure and design decisions for BEM++ are discussed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the library for larger problems.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.The 18th WHO Global Tuberculosis Annual Report indicates that there were an estimated 8.6 million incident cases of tuberculosis (TB) in 2012, which included 2.9 million women and 530,000 children. TB caused 1.3 million deaths including 320,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people; three-quarters of deaths occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia. With one-third of the world\u2019s population latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), active TB disease is primarily associated with a break down in immune surveillance. This explains the strong link between active TB disease and other communicable diseases (CDs) or noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) that exert a toll on the immune system. Comorbid NCD risk factors include diabetes, smoking, malnutrition, and chronic lung disease, all of which have increased relentlessly over the past decade in developing countries. The huge overlap between killer infections such as TB, HIV, malaria, and severe viral infections with NCDs, results in a \u201cdouble burden of disease\u201d in developing countries. The current focus on vertical disease programs fails to recognize comorbidities or to encourage joint management approaches. This review highlights major disease overlaps and discusses the rationale for better integration of tuberculosis care with services for NCDs and other infectious diseases to enhance the overall efficiency of the public health responses.",

Although workplaces are important settings for infectious disease transmission, few studies have collected workplace contact data and estimated workplace contact networks. We use contact diaries, architectural distance measures, and institutional structures to estimate social contact networks within a Swiss research institute. Some contact reports were inconsistent, indicating reporting errors. We adjust for this with a latent variable model, jointly estimating the true (unobserved) network of contacts and duration-specific reporting probabilities. We find that contact probability decreases with distance, and that research group membership, role, and shared projects are strongly predictive of contact patterns. Estimated reporting probabilities were low only for 0-5 min contacts. Adjusting for reporting error changed the estimate of the duration distribution, but did not change the estimates of covariate effects and had little effect on epidemic predictions. Our epidemic simulation study indicates that inclusion of network structure based on architectural and organizational structure data can improve the accuracy of epidemic forecasting models.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2015.A large number of statistical models are \"doubly-intractable\": the likelihood normalising term, which is a function of the model parameters, is intractable, as well as the marginal likelihood (model evidence). This means that standard inference techniques to sample from the posterior, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), cannot be used. Examples include, but are not confined to, massive Gaussian Markov random fields, autologistic models and Exponential random graph models. A number of approximate schemes based on MCMC techniques, Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) or analytic approximations to the posterior have been suggested, and these are reviewed here. Exact MCMC schemes, which can be applied to a subset of doubly-intractable distributions, have also been developed and are described in this paper. As yet, no general method exists which can be applied to all classes of models with doubly-intractable posteriors. In addition, taking inspiration from the Physics literature, we study an alternative method based on representing the intractable likelihood as an infinite series. Unbiased estimates of the likelihood can then be obtained by finite time stochastic truncation of the series via Russian Roulette sampling, although the estimates are not necessarily positive. Results from the Quantum Chromodynamics literature are exploited to allow the use of possibly negative estimates in a pseudo-marginal MCMC scheme such that expectations with respect to the posterior distribution are preserved. The methodology is reviewed on well-known examples such as the parameters in Ising models, the posterior for Fisher-Bingham distributions on the d-Sphere and a largescale Gaussian Markov Random Field model describing the Ozone Column data. This leads to a critical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology with pointers to ongoing research.",

Epidemics can spread by local spreading, where infected nodes can only infect a limited set of direct target nodes and global spreading, where an infected node can infect every other node. In reality, many epidemics spread using a hybrid mixture of both types of spreading. In this study we develop a theoretical framework for studying hybrid epidemics, and examine the optimum balance between spreading mechanisms in terms of achieving the maximum outbreak size. We show the existence of critically hybrid epidemics where neither spreading mechanism alone can cause a noticeable spread but a combination of the two spreading mechanisms would produce an enormous outbreak. Our results provide new strategies for maximising beneficial epidemics and estimating the worst outcome of damaging hybrid epidemics.",

SSc is clinically and aetiopathogenically heterogeneous. Consensus standards for more uniform trial design and selection of outcome measures are needed. The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based points to consider (PTCs) for future clinical trials in SSc.Methods. Thirteen international SSc experts experienced in SSc clinical trial design were invited to participate. One researcher with experience in systematic literature review and three trainees were also included. A systematic review using PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted and PTCs when designing clinical trials in SSc were developed. As part of that development we conducted an Internet-based Delphi exercise regarding the main points to be made in the consensus statement. Consensus was defined as achieving a median score of \u22657 of 9.Results. By consensus, the experts decided to develop PTCs for each individual organ system. The current document provides a unifying outline on PTCs regarding general trial design, inclusion/exclusion criteria and analysis. Consensus was achieved regarding all the main points of the PTCs.Conclusion. Using European League Against Rheumatism suggestions for PTCs, a general outline for PTCs for controlled clinical trials in SSc was developed. Specific outlines for individual organ systems are to be published separately. This general outline should lead to more uniform and higher-quality trials and clearly delineate areas where further research is needed.",

The model incorporates productivity shocks, long-term contracts, on-the-job search and counter-offers. Importantly, the model allows for the possibility of assortative matching between workers and jobs due to complementarities between worker and job characteristics. We use the model to estimate the potential gain from optimal regulation and we consider the potential gains and redistributive impacts from optimal unemployment benefit policy. Here optimal policy is defined as that which maximizes total output and home production, accounting for the various constraints that arise from search frictions.

            "Abstract": "Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), characterized by profound hypoglycaemia related to inappropriate insulin secretion, may be associated histologically with either diffuse insulin hypersecretion or focal adenomatous hyperplasia, which share a similar clinical presentation, but result from different molecular mechanisms. Whereas diffuse CHI is of autosomal recessive, or less frequently of autosomal dominant, inheritance, focal CHI is sporadic. The most common mechanism underlying CHI is dysfunction of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K+ATP). The two subunits of the K +ATP channel are encoded by the sulfonylurea receptor gene (SUR1 or ABCC8) and the inward-rectifying potassium channel gene (KIR6.2 or KCNJ11), both located in the 11p15.1 region. Germ-line, paternally inherited, mutations of the SUR1 or KIR6.2 genes, together with somatic maternal haplo-insufficiency for 11p15.5, were shown to result in focal CHI. Diffuse CHI results from germ-line mutations in the SUR1 or KIR6.2 genes, but also from mutations in several other genes, namely glutamate dehydrogenase (with associated hyperammonaemia), glucokinase, short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and insulin receptor gene. Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia may be observed in several overlapping syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Perlman syndrome, and, more rarely, Sotos syndrome. Mosaic genome-wide paternal isodisomy has recently been reported in patients with clinical signs of BWS and CHI. The primary causes of CHI are genetically heterogeneous and have not yet been completely unveiled. However, secondary causes of hyperinsulinism have to be considered such as fatty acid oxidation deficiency, congenital disorders of glycosylation and factitious hypoglycaemia secondary to Munchausen by proxy syndrome.

Epilepsy surgery encompasses curative resective procedures, palliative techniques such as corpus callosotomy and implantation of stimulation devices. Pre-surgical evaluation aims to identify the epileptogenic zone and to prevent post-operative neurological and cognitive deficits. This entails optimal imaging, prolonged video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments; some patients may then require nuclear medicine imaging and intracranial EEG recording. The best outcomes are in those with an electro-clinically concordant structural lesion on MRI (60%-70% seizure freedom). Lower rates of seizure freedom are expected in people with extra-temporal lobe foci, focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, normal structural imaging, psychiatric co-morbidity and learning disability. Nevertheless, surgery for epilepsy is under-used and should be considered for all patients with refractory focal epilepsy in whom two or three anti-epileptic medications have been ineffective.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry.Background: Adult onset primary torsion dystonia (AOPTD) is a poorly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder; most gene carriers are non-manifesting despite having reached an adequate age for penetrance. It is hypothesised that genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may exert protective or deleterious effects on penetrance of AOPTD. By examining environmental exposure history in cervical dystonia patients and their similarly aged unaffected siblings we aimed to determine the role of previous environmental exposures in relation to disease penetrance. Methods: A case-control study of 67 patients with cervical dystonia and 67 of their age-matched unaffected siblings was performed. Past environmental exposures were assessed using a detailed 124-question standardised questionnaire. Results: By univariate analysis, cervical dystonia patients, compared to their unaffected siblings, had an increased frequency of a history of car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 10.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 47.4, p=0.004) and surgical episodes (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.76 to 23.61, p=0.005). Following multivariate analysis, car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 37.6, p=0.017) and all surgical episodes (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.24 to 19.31, p=0.023) remained significantly associated with case status. Conclusions: Cervical dystonia patients had a history, prior to symptom onset, of significantly more frequent episodes of surgery and of car accidents with hospital attendance than their age-matched unaffected siblings. Soft tissue trauma appears to increase risk of development of cervical dystonia in genetically predetermined individuals.",

At pressures from 76 GPa to well over 100 GPa the most stable phase is a previously unknown CaCO3 structure of the pyroxene type with fourfold coordinated carbon atoms. We also predict a stable structure of MgCO3 in the range 85-101 GPa. Our results lead to a revision of the phase diagram of CaCO3 over more than half the pressure range encountered within the Earth's mantle, and smaller changes to the phase diagram of MgCO3. We predict CaCO3 to be more stable than MgCO3 in the Earth's mantle above 100 GPa, and that CO2 is not a thermodynamically stable compound under deep mantle conditions. Our results have significant implications for understanding the Earth's deep carbon cycle.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.Currency carry trade is the investment strategy that involves selling low interest rate currencies in order to purchase higher interest rate currencies, thus profiting from the interest rate differentials. This is a well known financial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is uninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one would not expect profits from such strategies. That is, according to uncovered interest rate parity (UIP), changes in the related exchange rates should offset the potential to profit from such interest rate differentials. However, it has been shown empirically, that investors can earn profits on average by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, whilst allowing for any losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. This paper explores the financial risk that trading strategies seeking to exploit a violation of the UIP condition are exposed to with respect to multivariate tail dependence present in both the funding and investment currency baskets. It will outline in what contexts these portfolio risk exposures will benefit accumulated portfolio returns and under what conditions such tail exposures will reduce portfolio returns.",

The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of HE in this group of patients are unclear but hyperammonemia, systemic inflammation (including sepsis, bacterial translocation, and insulin resistance) and oxidative stress, modulated by glutaminase gene alteration, remain as key factors. Moreover, alcohol misuse, hyponatremia, renal insufficiency, and microbiota are actively explored. HE diagnosis requires exclusion of other causes of neurological, metabolic and psychiatric dysfunction. Hospitalization in the ICU should be considered in every patient with overt HE, but particularly if this is associated with ACLF. Precipitating factors should be identified and treated as required. Evidence-based specific management options are limited to bowel cleansing and non-absorbable antibiotics. Ammonia lowering drugs, such as glycerol phenylbutyrate and ornithine phenylacetate show promise but are still in clinical trials. Albumin dialysis may be useful in refractory cases. Antibiotics, prebiotics, and treatment of diabetes reduce systemic inflammation. Where possible and not contraindicated, large portalsystemic shunts may be embolized but liver transplantation is the most definitive step in the management of HE in this setting. HE in patients with ACLF appears to be clinically and pathophysiologically distinct from that of acute decompensation and requires further studies and characterization.",

Seventy-five patients had the m.3243A>G mutation and the most frequent phenotypes within the entire cohort were 14 with MELAS, 33 with MIDD, and 17 with MERRF. Urinary RBP was increased in 29 of 75 of m.3243A>G patients, whereas albumin was increased in 23 of the 75. The corresponding numbers were 16 and 14, respectively, in the 42 non-m.3243A>G patients. RBP and albumin were higher in diabetic m.3243A>G patients than in nondiabetics, but there were no significant differences across the three major clinical phenotypes. The urine proteome (mass spectrometry) and metabonome (nuclear magnetic resonance) in a subset of the m.3243A>G patients were markedly different from controls, with the most significant alterations occurring in lysosomal proteins, calcium-binding proteins, and antioxidant defenses. Differences were also found between asymptomatic m.3243A>G carriers and controls. No patients had an elevated serum creatinine level, but 14% had hyponatremia, 10% had hypophosphatemia, and 14% had hypomagnesemia. Thus, abnormalities in kidney function are common in adults with mitochondrial disease, exist in the absence of elevated serum creatinine, and are not solely explained by diabetes.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 European Association of Urology.Background Standard chemotherapy for poor-prognosis metastatic nonseminoma has remained bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) for many years; more effective regimens are required. Objective To explore whether response rates with a new intensive chemotherapy regimen, CBOP/BEP (carboplatin, bleomycin, vincristine, cisplatin/BEP), versus those in concurrent patients treated with standard BEP justify a phase 3 trial. Design, setting, and participants We conducted a phase 2 open-label randomised trial in patients with germ cell tumours of any extracranial primary site and one or more International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group poor-prognosis features. Patients were randomised between 2005 and 2009 at 16 UK centres. Intervention BEP (bleomycin 30 000 IU) was composed of four cycles over 12 wk. CBOP/BEP was composed of 2 \u00d7 CBOP, 2 \u00d7 BO, and 3 \u00d7 BEP (bleomycin 15 000 IU). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Primary end point was favourable response rate (FRR) comprising complete response or partial response and normal markers. Success required the lower two-sided 90% confidence limit to exclude FRRs <60%; 44 patients on CBOP/BEP gives 90% power to achieve this if the true FRR is \u226480%. Equal numbers were randomised to BEP to benchmark contemporary response rates. Results and limitations A total of 89 patients were randomised (43 CBOP/BEP, 46 BEP); 40 and 41, respectively, completed treatment. CBOP/BEP toxicity, largely haematologic, was high (96% vs 63% on BEP had Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3 grade \u22643). FRRs were 74% (90% confidence interval [CI], 61-85) with CBOP/BEP, 61% with BEP (90% CI, 48-73). After a median of 58-mo follow-up, 1-yr progression-free survival (PFS) was 65% and 43%, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.59; 95% CI, 0.33-1.06); 2-yr overall survival (OS) was 67% and 61%. Overall, 3 of 14 CBOP/BEP and 2 of 18 BEP deaths were attributed to toxicity, one after an overdose of bleomycin during CBOP/BEP. The trial was not powered to compare PFS. Conclusions The primary outcome was met, the CI for CBOP/BEP excluding FRRs <61%, but CBOP/BEP was more toxic. PFS and OS data are promising but require confirmation in an international phase 3 trial. Patient summary In this study we tested a new, more intensive way to deliver a combination of drugs often used to treat men with testicular cancer. We found that response rates were higher but that the CBOP/BEP regimen caused more short-term toxicity. Because most patients are diagnosed when their cancer is less advanced, it took twice as long to complete the trial as expected. Although we plan to carry out a larger trial, we will need international collaboration.",

Here we use archaeological data for this purpose, which brings in a temporal as well as spatial dimension. We analyse two distinct material cultures (pottery and personal ornaments) from Neolithic Europe, in order to: a) determine whether archaeologically defined \"cultures\" exhibit marked discontinuities in space and time, supporting the existence of a population structure, or merely isolation-by-distance; and b) investigate the extent to which cultures can be conceived as structuring \"cores\" or as multiple and historically independent \"packages\". Our results support the existence of a robust population structure comparable to previous studies on human culture, and show how the two material cultures exhibit profound differences in their spatial and temporal structuring, signalling different evolutionary trajectories.",

            "Abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising drug delivery systems particularly for cancer therapy, due to their abilities to overcome some of the challenges faced by cancer treatment, namely non-specificity, poor permeability into tumour tissues, and poor stability of anticancer drugs. Encapsulation of anticancer agents inside CNTs provides protection from external deactivating agents. However, the open ends of the CNTs leave the encapsulated drugs exposed to the environment and eventually their uncontrolled release before reaching the desired target. In this study, we report the successful encapsulation of cisplatin, a FDA-approved chemotherapeutic drug, into multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the capping at the ends with functionalised gold nanoparticles to achieve a \"carbon nanotube bottle\" structure. In this proof-of-concept study, these caps did not prevent the encapsulation of drug in the inner space of CNTs; on the contrary, we achieved higher drug loading inside the nanotubes in comparison with data reported in literature. In addition, we demonstrated that encapsulated cisplatin could be delivered in living cells under physiological conditions to exert its pharmacological action. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The total wave elevation and the total velocity potential are separated into two parts, based on the incoming wave from infinity and the disturbed potential by the body. The mesh is generated only once at the initial time and the element nodes are rearranged subsequently without changing their connectivity by using a spring analogy method. Through some auxiliary functions, the mutual dependence of fluid/structure motions are decoupled, which allows the body acceleration to be obtained without the knowledge of the pressure distribution. Numerical results are provided for forces and run-ups of a fixed cylinder with flare and the comparison is made with the second order theory in the frequency domain. Simulations are also made for a freely floating body responding to wave excitation. Resonance related to ringing excited by the high order force at the triple wave frequency is discussed. Further results are provided for motions, forces and run-ups of a floating cylinder with flare. Comparison with the results for the fixed body and body in single degree of freedom is made.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Background: A recent Cochrane Review found that preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in patients with resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice is associated with similar mortality but increased serious morbidity compared with no PBD. Despite this clinical evidence of its lack of effectiveness, PBD is still in use. We considered the economic implications of PBD versus direct surgery for obstructive jaundice in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Materials and methods: Model-based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK National Health Service over a 6-month time horizon. A decision tree model was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes, and cost data from published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Results: PBD was more costly than direct surgery (mean cost per patient \u00a310,775 [$15,616] versus \u00a38221 [$11,914]) and produced fewer QALYs (mean QALYs per patient 0.337 versus 0.343). Not performing PBD would result in cost savings of approximately \u00a32500 ($3623) per patient to the National Health Service. PBD had <10% probability of being cost-effective at a maximum willingness to pay for a QALY of \u00a320,000 ($28,986) to \u00a330,000 ($43,478). Conclusions: There are significant cost savings to be gained by avoiding routine PBD in patients with resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer where PBD is still routinely used in this context; this economic evidence should be used to support the clinical argument for a change in practice.",

A parametric plot is constructed to identify a rotating speed and working pressure regime, which allows for continuous bubbling. Bare protein (lysozyme) microbubbles generated in this way exhibit a morphological change, resulting in microcapsules over a period of time. Microbubbles prepared with gold nanoparticles at the bubble surface showed greater stability over a time period and retained the same morphology. The functionalization of microbubbles with gold nanoparticles also rendered optical tunability and has promising applications in imaging, biosensing, and diagnostics.",

Whole gene deletions, nonsense variants and missense variants affecting the DNA-binding domain have been seen in association with a Sotos-like phenotype that we propose is referred to as Malan syndrome. Frameshift and splice-site variants thought to avoid nonsense-mediated RNA decay have been seen in Marshall-Smith syndrome. We report six additional patients with Malan syndrome and de novo NFIX deletions or sequence variants and review the 20 patients now reported. The phenotype is characterised by moderate postnatal overgrowth and macrocephaly. Median height and head circumference in childhood are 2.0 and 2.3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean, respectively. There is overlap of the facial phenotype with NSD1-positive Sotos syndrome in some cases including a prominent forehead, high anterior hairline, downslanting palpebral fissures and prominent chin. Neonatal feeding difficulties and/or hypotonia have been reported in 30% of patients. Developmental delay/learning disability have been reported in all cases and are typically moderate. Ocular phenotypes are common, including strabismus (65%), nystagmus (25%) and optic disc pallor/hypoplasia (25%). Other recurrent features include pectus excavatum (40%) and scoliosis (25%). Eight reported patients have a deletion also encompassing CACNA1A, haploinsufficiency of which causes episodic ataxia type 2 or familial hemiplegic migraine. One previous case had episodic ataxia and one case we report has had cyclical vomiting responsive to pizotifen. In individuals with this contiguous gene deletion syndrome, awareness of possible later neurological manifestations is important, although their penetrance is not yet clear.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.More than 75 million people worldwide have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and there are now approximately 37 million individuals living with the infection. Untreated HIV replication causes progressive CD4+ T cell loss and a wide range of immunological abnormalities, leading to an increased risk of infectious and oncological complications. HIV infection also contributes to cardiovascular disease, bone disease, renal and hepatic dysfunction and several other common morbidities. Antiretroviral drugs are highly effective at inhibiting HIV replication, and for individuals who can access and adhere to these drugs, combination antiretroviral therapy leads to durable (and probably lifelong) suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression enables immune recovery and the near elimination of the risk for developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite effective treatment, HIV-infected individuals have a higher than expected risk of heart, bone, liver, kidney and neurological disease. When used optimally by an infected (or by an uninfected) person, antiretroviral drugs can virtually eliminate the risk of HIV transmission. Despite major advances in prevention sciences, HIV transmission remains common in many vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men, injection drug users and sex workers. Owing to a lack of widespread HIV testing and the costs and toxicities associated with antiretroviral drugs, the majority of the infected population is not on effective antiretroviral therapy. To reverse the pandemic, improved prevention, treatment and implementation approaches are necessary.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background & Aims: Chronic liver disease is a predisposing factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Toll-like receptors play a crucial role in immunity against microbial pathogens and recent evidence suggests that they may also be important in pathogenesis of chronic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether TLR7 and TLR9 are potential targets for prevention and progression of HCC. Methods: Tissue microarrays containing liver samples from patients with cirrhosis, viral hepatitis and HCC were examined for expression of TLR7 and TLR9 and the data obtained was validated in liver specimens from the hospital archives. Proliferation of human HCC cell lines was studied following stimulation of TLR7 and TLR9 using agonists (imiquimod and CpG-ODN respectively) and inhibition with a specific antagonist (IRS-954) or chloroquine. The effect of these interventions was confirmed in a xenograft model and diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/nitrosomorpholine (NMOR)-induced model of HCC. Results: TLR7 and TLR9 expression was up-regulated in human HCC tissue. Proliferation of HuH7 cells in vitro increased significantly in response to stimulation of TLR7. TLR7 and TLR9 inhibition using IRS-954 or chloroquine significantly reduced HuH7 cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited tumour growth in the mouse xenograft model. HCC development in the DEN/NMOR rat model was also significantly inhibited by chloroquine (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The data suggest that inhibiting TLR7 and TLR9 with IRS-954 or chloroquine could potentially be used as a novel therapeutic approach for preventing HCC development and/or progression in susceptible patients.",

However, lesions larger than this require a tracheal replacement, of which there are currently few options available. The recent advancement of tissue-engineering principles in tracheal research is quickly opening up new vistas for airway reconstruction and creating a very promising future for medical science. This review discusses the main criteria required for the development of a tissue-engineered tracheal replacement. The criteria include: (a) appropriate cell types and sources; (b) biomolecules to direct the differentiation of the cells to the desired lineage (c) a suitable scaffold for a cellular matrix; and (d) a bioreactor to facilitate cell attachment and proliferation and construct transport to theatre. Our group has designed and developed the world's first synthetic tracheal replacement, using a novel nanocomposite material, also developed in our laboratory. It was implanted clinically in June 2011 with a successful outcome. The application of tissue-engineering approaches to tracheal replacement development is the first step towards the much-anticipated 'off-the-shelf' tissue-engineered technology, contributing extensively to the advancement in treatment and rehabilitation of patients afflicted with tracheal pathology.",

            "Abstract": "Objective To determine whether the addition of 26 weeks of subcutaneous peginterferon-\u03b1-2b could reduce the requirement for systemic corticosteroids and conventional immunosuppressive medication in patients with Beh\u00e7et's disease (BD). Methods: We conducted a multicentre randomised trial in patients with BD requiring systemic therapy. Patients were randomised to 26 weeks of peginterferon-\u03b1-2b in addition to their standard care or to standard care only and followed 6-monthly for 3 years with BD activity scores and quality of life questionnaires. Patients at one centre had blood taken to measure regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells. Results: 72 patients were included. At months 10-12, while among the entire patient population there was no difference in the corticosteroid dose or immunosuppression use between the treatment groups (adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.19), post hoc analysis revealed that in patients who were on corticosteroids at baseline the corticosteroid requirement was significantly lower in the peginterferon-\u03b1-2b (6.5 (5-15) mg/day) compared with the non-interferon group (10 (8.25-16.5) mg/day, p=0.039). Furthermore, there was a trend towards an improved quality of life that became significant by 36 months (p=0.008). This was associated with a significant rise in Tregs and a decrease in Th17 cells which was still present at 1 year and 6 months after the interferon was stopped. The safety profile was similar with adverse events in 10% in both groups. Conclusions: The addition of peginterferon-\u03b1-2b to the drug regime of BD patients did not significantly reduce their corticosteroid dose required at 1 year. However, in those on corticosteroids at baseline post hoc analysis demonstrated that the addition of peginterferon-\u03b1-2b did result in a significant reduction in corticosteroid dose with a significantly improved quality of life and trend to reduce other required immunosuppressive agents. This effect was seen at 1 year and associated with a rise in Tregs suggesting a possible mode for interferon action.",

The videos were created by a motion tracking system, and showed dots that had been placed at various points on the body, so that body motion was the only visible cue. One of the figures displayed pain behaviors (eg, rubbing, holding, hesitating), while the other did not. Without any other information about the person in each video, participants evaluated each person on a variety of attributes associated with interpersonal warmth, competence, mood, and physical fitness. As well as judging them to be in more pain, participants evaluated the person who displayed pain behavior as less warm and less competent than the person who did not display pain behavior. In addition, the person who displayed pain behavior was perceived to be in a more negative mood and to have poorer physical fitness than the person who did not, and these perceptions contributed to the impact of pain behaviors on evaluations of warmth and competence, respectively. The implications of these negative social evaluations for social relationships, well-being, and pain assessment in persons in chronic pain are discussed.",

This study investigated the incidence of BK viremia and BK viral\u2013associated nephropathy (BKVAN) in pRTR. One-hundred-and-thirty-four pRTR were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 20, 14.9%) comprised those who were prospectively followed with longitudinal analyses after renal transplantation in the time period from May 2007 to June 2008, while group 2 (n = 114, 85.1%) cross-sectional study of those who were transplanted from January 1994 to April 2007. The mean ages at transplantation in groups 1 and 2 were 10.6 \u00b1 4.7 years and 7.8 \u00b1 4.5 years, respectively. BK viremia was detected in four (20.0%) patients in group 1, and seven (6.1%) in group 2 (P = 0.04), with increased incidence associated with induction therapy. The median time to detection of BK viremia after transplantation was 44 days in group 1 and 142 days in group 2. BKVAN was diagnosed in three patients (two in group 1 and one in group 2). All three patients diagnosed with BKVAN were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppression. Reducing immunosuppression resulted in reduced BK viremia. Monitoring for BK viremia and BKVAN is important in pRTR being treated with the current immunosuppressive regimen. The first line of treatment for BK viremia remains careful reduction of immunosuppression and close monitoring of renal allograft function.",

The subjective visual vertical and horizontal (SVV/SVH) were tested from min 25 of exposure. There was no exposure effect; however, there was an ear effect, with the SVV/SVH being shifted to the opposite direction of the ear exposed. This could be due to thermal or RF effects or handset weight. In experiment II, we assessed the handset weight effect on 18 normal controls. After baseline SVV/SVH, the switched off handset was strapped to either ear; the SVV/SVH was repeated 25min later. A significant ear effect was found. We compared the observed ear effect SVV/SVH change in the experiment II group to the continuous exposure ear effect change in the experiment I group, and the difference was not significant. The ear effect was attributed to a minor head tilt due to the handset weight, or proprioceptive stimulation of neck muscle affecting the perception of verticality.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 British Neuropathological SocietyAims: Current therapies in Parkinson's disease mainly treat symptoms rather than provide effective neuroprotection. We examined the effects of safinamide (monoamine oxidase B and sodium channel blocker) on microglial activation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of PD in vivo, and on microglia in vitro. Methods: Rats received unilateral stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the medial forebrain bundle on day 0: The contralateral side served as control. Safinamide or vehicle was delivered from days 0 or 1, for 7 days, via sub-cutaneous mini-pumps. Results: In vehicle-treated rats 6-hydroxydopamine caused a significant increase in the number of activated MHC-II+ microglia compared with the contralateral side, and only 50% of the dopaminergic neurons survived in the ipsilateral SNc. In contrast, rats treated daily with safinamide 50 and 150 mg/ml (on day 0 or 1) exhibited a significantly reduced number of activated microglia (55% reduction at 150 mg/ml) and a significant protection of dopaminergic neurons (80% of neurons survived) (P < 0.001) compared with vehicle-treated controls. Rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, and lamotrigine, a sodium channel blocking drug, also protected dopaminergic neurons, indicating that safinamide may act by either or both mechanisms. Safinamide also reduced the activation of microglial cells in response to lipopolysaccharide exposure in vitro. Conclusion: Safinamide therapy suppresses microglial activation and protects dopaminergic neurons from degeneration in the 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD, suggesting that the drug not only treats symptoms but also provides neuroprotection.",

We take an off-the-shelf search model and calibrate it to data on the control group from a randomized social experiment. We then simulate a program group from a randomized experiment within the model. As a measure of the performance of the model, we compare the outcomes of the program groups from the model and from the randomized experiment. We illustrate our methodology using the Canadian Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP), a social experiment providing a time-limited earnings supplement for Income Assistance recipients who obtain full-time employment within a 12-month period. We find two features of the model are consistent with the experimental results: endogenous search intensity and exogenous job destruction. We find mixed evidence in support of the assumption of fixed hours of labor supply. Finally, we find a constant job destruction rate is not consistent with the experimental data in this context.

The limitations and potential improvements of reference (normative) data sets for ophthalmic imaging devices will be discussed. Method: A symposium was held in July 2013 in which a series of speakers discussed issues related to the development of reference databases for imaging devices. Results: Automated imaging has become widely accepted and used in glaucoma management. The ability of such instruments to discriminate healthy from glaucomatous optic nerves, and to detect glaucomatous progression over time is limited by the quality of reference databases associated with the available commercial devices. In the absence of standardized rules governing the development of reference databases, each manufacturer's database differs in size, eligibility criteria, and ethnic make-up, among other key features. Conclusions: The process for development of imaging reference databases may be improved by standardizing eligibility requirements and data collection protocols. Such standardization may also improve the degree to which results may be compared between commercial instruments.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Cambridge University Press.Past research has documented pervasive genetic influences on emotional and behavioral disturbance across the life span and on liability to adult psychiatric disorder. Increasingly, interest is turning to mechanisms of gene-environment interplay in attempting to understand the earliest manifestations of genetic risk. We report findings from a prospective adoption study, which aimed to test the role of evocative gene-environment correlation in early development. Included in the study were 561 infants adopted at birth and studied between 9 and 27 months, along with their adoptive parents and birth mothers. Birth mother psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms scales were used as indicators of genetic influence, and multiple self-report measures were used to index adoptive mother parental negativity. We hypothesized that birth mother psychopathology would be associated with greater adoptive parent negativity and that such evocative effects would be amplified under conditions of high adoptive family adversity. The findings suggested that genetic factors associated with birth mother externalizing psychopathology may evoke negative reactions in adoptive mothers in the first year of life, but only when the adoptive family environment is characterized by marital problems. Maternal negativity mediated the effects of genetic risk on child adjustment at 27 months. The results underscore the importance of genetically influenced evocative processes in early development.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.Total intracranial volume (TIV/ICV) is an important covariate for volumetric analyses of the brain and brain regions, especially in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, where it can provide a proxy of maximum pre-morbid brain volume. The gold-standard method is manual delineation of brain scans, but this requires careful work by trained operators. We evaluated Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) automated segmentation for TIV measurement in place of manual segmentation and also compared it with SPM8 and FreeSurfer 5.3.0. For T1-weighted MRI acquired from 288 participants in a multi-centre clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease we find a high correlation between SPM12 TIV and manual TIV (R<sup>2</sup>=0.940, 95% Confidence Interval (0.924, 0.953)), with a small mean difference (SPM12 40.4\u00b135.4ml lower than manual, amounting to 2.8% of the overall mean TIV in the study). The correlation with manual measurements (the key aspect when using TIV as a covariate) for SPM12 was significantly higher (p<0.001) than for either SPM8 (R<sup>2</sup>=0.577 CI (0.500, 0.644)) or FreeSurfer (R<sup>2</sup>=0.801 CI (0.744, 0.843)). These results suggest that SPM12 TIV estimates are an acceptable substitute for labour-intensive manual estimates even in the challenging context of multiple centres and the presence of neurodegenerative pathology. We also briefly discuss some aspects of the statistical modelling approaches to adjust for TIV.",

Subjects were asked to walk 10 m at their own self-selected speed. The ranges of motion of thigh, shank, and knee in both swing and stance phase were calculated, in addition to stride duration. Thigh, shank, and knee range of movement in swing and stance were significantly different only in the > 80 age group. Regressions of angle against age showed a cubic relationship.

PPAR\u03b3 was initially identified through its role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and cell differentiation. It also influences the expression or activity of a number of genes in a variety of signalling networks. These include regulation of redox balance, fatty acid oxidation, immune responses and mitochondrial function. Recent studies suggest that the PPAR\u03b3 agonists may serve as good candidates for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, even though multiple etiological factors contribute to the development of these disorders. Recent reports have also signposted a role for PPAR\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. In this review, we explore the current knowledge of mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of PPAR\u03b3 agonists and PGC-1\u03b1 in models of PD.",

In predictive coding, high-level cortical areas inform sensory cortex about incoming sensory signals, a comparison between the predicted and actual sensory feedback is made, and information about unpredicted sensory information is passed forward to higher-level areas. Predictions about animate motion - relative to inanimate motion - should result in prediction error and increase signal passing from lower level sensory area MT+/V5, which is responsive to all motion, to higher-order posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which is selectively activated by animate motion. We tested this hypothesis by investigating effective connectivity in a large-scale fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project. 132 participants viewed animations of triangles that were designed to move in a way that appeared animate (moving intentionally), or inanimate (moving in a mechanical way). We found that forward connectivity from V5 to the pSTS increased, and inhibitory self-connection in the pSTS decreased, when viewing intentional motion versus inanimate motion. These prediction errors associated with animate motion may be the cause for increased attention to animate stimuli found in previous studies.",

The historical evolution of these strategies is examined in relation to the designs of individual memorials. The analysis identifies a range of planning strategies that significantly influence the design of individual memorials, including large-scale memorial precinct plans, the social meanings of surrounding sites and structures and existing memorials, and the uses of memorial sites for activities other than grieving. The article examines controversies surrounding the siting, design, meaning and public use of a number of specific memorial examples.

The Geographical Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).Devolution has led to a dramatic restructuring of the UK state over the last 15 years. Planning is a devolved function and a concerted process of 'planning reform' has been implemented by devolved (and central) government since devolution, including a move from 'land-use' to 'spatial planning'. Despite some expectations of, and pressure for, policy divergence post devolution, we draw on findings of discourse analysis to demonstrate how there are common framings and understandings of the concept of 'spatial planning' present in the policy documents of all the UK administrations, and in Ireland. As such, we conceptualise spatial planning as what, after Peck and Theodore (2010, Geoforum 41 169-74), we might consider a 'policy on the move'. Policy mobility is a fundamentally geographical phenomenon and its presence here raises questions about the mechanisms by which spatial planning has been mobilised. Drawing on interview data, we highlight the role of civil servants who meet through the British-Irish Council's workstream on spatial planning and a forum known as the 'Five Administrations' meetings. The relational connections between these state actors suggest that they are key 'transfer agents' and their role helps explain some of the path dependency in planning reform post devolution.",

Definitions and conceptualizations vary both within and across countries (Banks 2009; Grant and Portera 2011; Gundara 2015). It even evolves over time, adding new concepts and ideas to its original meanings (May and Sleeter 2010; Wright et al. 2012). Despite such complexity, few would disagree that envisioning and implementing an inclusive education toward social justice and equity for all children regardless of their cultural group memberships is an integral part of multicultural education. Also, multicultural education is often understood as an important tool to equip all future citizens with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to live in a culturally diverse society. Most educational policies that are based on or influenced by multicultural principles valorize cultural diversity as a way of creating a new form of social unity for a democratic society. Multicultural education, in such a broad sense, has emerged as an important policy issue in an increasing number of countries around the world (Cha et al. 2012; Sutton 2005).",

This paper describes the creation and characteristics of the 2XMM catalogue.Methods. The 2XMM catalogue has been compiled from a new processing of the XMM-Newton EPIC camera data. The main features of the processing pipeline are described in detail. Results. The catalogue, the largest ever made at X-ray wavelengths, contains 246 897 detections drawn from 3491 public XMM-Newton observations over a 7-year interval, which relate to 191 870 unique sources. The catalogue fields cover a sky area of more than 500 deg2. The non-overlapping sky area is \u223c360 deg2 (\u223c1% of the sky) as many regions of the sky are observed more than once by XMM-Newton. The catalogue probes a large sky area at the flux limit where the bulk of the objects that contribute to the X-ray background lie and provides a major resource for generating large, well-defined X-ray selected source samples, studying the X-ray source population and identifying rare object types. The main characteristics of the catalogue are presented, including its photometric and astrometric properties . \u00a9 2008 ESO.",

            "DOI": "10.1093/heapol/czu055",
            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Published by Oxford University Press in association with The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of early childhood interventions to improve the growth and development of children. Although, historically, nutrition and stimulation interventions may have been delivered separately, they are increasingly being tested as a package of early childhood interventions that synergistically improve outcomes over the life course. However, implementation at scale is seldom possible without first considering the relative cost and cost-effectiveness of these interventions. An evidence gap in this area may deter large-scale implementation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We conduct a literature review to establish what is known about the cost-effectiveness of early childhood nutrition and development interventions. A set of predefined search terms and exclusion criteria standardized the search across five databases. The search identified 15 relevant articles. Of these, nine were from studies set in high-income countries and six in low- and middle-income countries. The articles either calculated the cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions (n = 8) aimed at improving child growth, or parenting interventions (stimulation) to improve early childhood development (n = 7). No articles estimated the cost-effectiveness of combined interventions. Comparing results within nutrition or stimulation interventions, or between nutrition and stimulation interventions was largely prevented by the variety of outcome measures used in these analyses. This article highlights the need for further evidence relevant to low- and middle-income countries. To facilitate comparison of cost-effectiveness between studies, and between contexts where appropriate, a move towards a common outcome measure such as the cost per disability-adjusted life years averted is advocated. Finally, given the increasing number of combined nutrition and stimulation interventions being tested, there is a significant need for evidence of cost-effectiveness for combined programmes. This too would be facilitated by the use of a common outcome measure able to pool the impact of both nutrition and stimulation activities.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.Objective: to investigate the relationship between frequency of ultrasounds and birthplace preference. Study design: retrospective case-control study with the number of ultrasounds as the exposure and the pregnant woman's preference to give birth in a low-technology setting (midwifery-led unit or home) or a high-technology setting (obstetric unit) as the primary outcome. Sample and Setting: low-risk primigravid women receiving antenatal care at a central London academic medical centre. Measurements: antenatal ultrasound frequency; birthplace preference at the initial pregnancy appointment (T1) and at the commencement of labour (T2); demographic data including ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, age, and body mass index. Findings: 1100 cases were reviewed. Women received an average of 4.03 ultrasounds during their pregnancy (SD=1.96, range 2-14). The frequency of ultrasounds for women who had a low-technology T2 birthplace preference was significantly lower than for those who had a high-technology T2 birthplace preference (t=2.98, df=1098, p=0.003, r=0.1), and women who had a constant low-technology birthrate preference had significantly less ultrasounds than other women (F (3,644)=3.475, p = .02). However, within a logistic regression the frequency of ultrasound was not associated with T2 birthplace preference, after controlling for T1 birthplace preference. Key conclusions: the findings of this investigation suggest that a preference made early in pregnancy is a greater predictor of birthplace preference than exposure to antenatal ultrasounds. Implications for practice: further research is required to inform interventions that would encourage low-risk pregnant women to select a low-technology place of birth.",

We also tested three groups of people (total 1,102) working in very different sectors: finance, insurance, and emergency services. They all completed the Hogan Development Survey (HDS; Hogan & Hogan, 1997), which is a measure of dysfunctional personality styles or potential management derailers. It has 11 dimensions and three higher order factors. Multivariate and univariate analyses of co-variance (controlling for sex, age, and social desirability) and logistic regressions showed many significant differences, with private sector employees scoring higher on the factor Moving Against/Cluster B and lower on the factor Moving Away/Cluster A. The analysis of the three groups showed that those in the emergency services differed on most traits while Finance and Insurance industry personnel were very similar.",

Clean Delivery Kits (CDKs) promote clean delivery and neonatal care. Our qualitative research explores reasons for low CDK utilization, and describes community perceptions of CDKs in Nepal. Methods: We conducted 18 focus group discussions and 40 interviews with CDK users and nonusers, service providers, birth attendants, and household decision makers in 6 districts. We also conducted interviews with central level personnel. CDK users were aware of its benefits, and utilization was largely compatible with birth practices. Utilization was prevented by lack of awareness about the benefits and lack of availability. Participants believed that CDKs were for home use. Conclusion: Poor promotion of CDK is related to the disjuncture of promoting CDK use, while encouraging institutional deliveries. If CDKs are made available and marketed for use in households and health institutions, utilization may increase.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO 2015.The Andromeda galaxy (M 31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficient angular size on the sky to be resolved by the Planck satellite. Planck has detected M 31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dust emission with the High Frequency Instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. We examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dust emission as seen by Planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, and investigate the dust heating mechanism across M 31. We find that dust dominating the longer wavelength emission (\u2265 0.3 mm) is heated by the diffuse stellar population (as traced by 3.6 \u03bcm emission), with the dust dominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellar population and star-forming regions (as traced by 24 \u03bcm emission). We also fit spectral energy distributions for individual 5\u2032 pixels and quantify the dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these different heating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature with galactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as would be expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22 K in the nucleus to 14 K outside of the 10 kpc ring. Finally, we measure the integrated spectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a global dust temperature of (18.2 \u00b1 1.0) K with a spectral index of 1.62 \u00b1 0.11 (assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-free emission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60 GHz, which corresponds to a star formation rate of around 0.12 M\u2299 yr-1. We find a 2.3\u03c3 detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a 30 GHz amplitude of 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 Jy, which is in line with expectations from our Galaxy.",

Both the standard Fourier-Bessel and also the Fourier-Laguerre spectral domains are considered since the latter exhibits a number of practical advantages such as spectral decoupling and exact computation. The Slepian spatial and spectral concentration problems are formulated as eigenvalue problems, the eigenfunctions of which form an orthogonal family of concentrated functions. Equivalence between the spatial and spectral problems is shown. The spherical Shannon number on the ball is derived, which acts as the analog of the space-bandwidth product in the Euclidean setting, giving an estimate of the number of concentrated eigenfunctions and thus the dimension of the space of functions that can be concentrated in both the spatial and spectral domains simultaneously. Various symmetries of the spatial region are considered that reduce considerably the computational burden of recovering eigenfunctions, either by decoupling the problem into smaller subproblems or by affording analytic calculations. The family of concentrated eigenfunctions forms a Slepian basis that can be used to represent concentrated signals efficiently. We illustrate our results with numerical examples and show that the Slepian basis indeed permits a sparse representation of concentrated signals.",

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial and is supported by diagnostic criteria, incorporating imaging and spinal fluid abnormalities for those presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome. Importantly, there is an extensive therapeutic armamentarium, both oral and by infusion, for those with the relapsing remitting form of the disease. Careful consideration is required when choosing the correct treatment, balancing the side-effect profile with efficacy and escalating as clinically appropriate. This move towards more personalised medicine is supported by a clinical guideline published in 2018. Finally, a comprehensive management programme is strongly recommended for all patients with multiple sclerosis, enhancing health-related quality of life through advocating wellness, addressing aggravating factors, and managing comorbidities. The greatest remaining challenge for multiple sclerosis is the development of treatments incorporating neuroprotection and remyelination to treat and ultimately prevent the disabling, progressive forms of the condition.",

Two examiners clinically graded the flare in 110 eyes. The flare was then measured using the Kowa laser flare meter. Twenty-nine eyes were graded as anterior chamber flare +2; for 18 of these, the clinicians were in agreement, the rest differed by the order of one grade. The range of the laser flare meter for these eyes was 5.2\u2013899.1 photons/ms. The median value was 41.4. Seventy-four eyes were graded with flare +1. Agreement was established in 51 of these eyes. Disagreement for the rest was again by the order of 1, and the flare meter range was 1.1\u2013169.9 photons/ms, median value 18.4. For the clinical measure of flare 0, the clinicians disagreed on three out of five eyes. The flare meter readings ranged from 2.5 to 14.1 photons/ms, median value 9.9. Only two eyes were graded with flare +3 and there was one step disagreement on both of them. We found little evidence of association between the flare readings and intraocular pressure or age. Our findings suggest that clinical evaluation of aqueous flare is subjective. Compared with the Kowa laser flare meter\u2019s numeric readings, the discrepancies observed indicate that clinical grading is an approximate science. The laser flare meter provides an accurate, reproducible, non-invasive assessment of aqueous flare that can prove valuable in research and clinical decisions.",

A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate available evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These results were first published in Lung Cancer in 2013. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of PORT on survival and recurrence in patients with completely resected NSCLC. To investigate whether predefined patient subgroups benefit more or less from PORT. Search methods: We supplemented MEDLINE and CANCERLIT searches (1965 to 8 July 2016) with information from trial registers, handsearching of relevant meeting proceedings and discussion with trialists and organisations. Selection criteria: We included trials of surgery versus surgery plus radiotherapy, provided they randomised participants with NSCLC using a method that precluded prior knowledge of treatment assignment. Data collection and analysis: We carried out a quantitative meta-analysis using updated information from individual participants from all randomised trials. We sought data on all participants from those responsible for the trial. We obtained updated individual participant data (IPD) on survival and date of last follow-up, as well as details on treatment allocation, date of randomisation, age, sex, histological cell type, stage, nodal status and performance status. To avoid potential bias, we requested information on all randomised participants, including those excluded from investigators' original analyses. We conducted all analyses on intention-to-treat on the endpoint of survival. Main results: We identified 14 trials evaluating surgery versus surgery plus radiotherapy. Individual participant data were available for 11 of these trials, and our analyses are based on 2343 participants (1511 deaths). Results show a significant adverse effect of PORT on survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.18, or an 18% relative increase in risk of death. This is equivalent to an absolute detriment of 5% at two years (95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 9%), reducing overall survival from 58% to 53%. Subgroup analyses showed no differences in effects of PORT by any participant subgroup covariate. We did not undertake analysis of the effects of PORT on quality of life and adverse events. Investigators did not routinely collect quality of life information during these trials, and it was unlikely that any benefit of PORT would offset the observed survival disadvantage. We considered risk of bias in the included trials to be low. Authors' conclusions: Results from 11 trials and 2343 participants show that PORT is detrimental to those with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer and should not be used in the routine treatment of such patients. Results of ongoing RCTs will clarify the effects of modern radiotherapy in patients with N2 tumours.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2015.In recent work it has been demonstrated by various scholars that the use of modal verbs has changed in past decades (Krug 2000; Leech 2003; Smith 2003; and especially Leech et al. 2009). In earlier work Close and Aarts (2010) and Aarts, Close, and Wallis (2013) looked at the changing use of the modal and semi-modal auxiliaries in spoken English. While the results of these investigations are extremely valuable, they tell us very little about how modal verb usage has changed within the various modal verb phrase patterns.To our knowledge no one has ever looked at the frequencies of these various patterns, let alone how they have changed over time. In Section 4.2 we briefly introduce the Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English (DCPSE; Aarts and Wallis 2006) which has been used as a database for the present research. In Section 4.3 we look at previous research on changes in the use of modal verbs as individual items (\u2018core modals\u2019) in written English. We will compare our findings on spoken English with those obtained by Leech (2003) and Leech et al. (2009) for written English in Section 4.4. In Section 4.5 we look at relative changes, while in Section 4.6 we will present the results of the research we have done on modal verbs occurring in various patterns, and how modal usage in these patterns has developed over time. In Section 4.7 we discuss our results. The final section is the conclusion. The database: Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English DCPSE is a corpus of parsed (grammatically analyzed) spoken English which contains approximately 885,000 words: 464,000 taken from the London-Lund Corpus (LLC) which was collected between the 1960s and 1970s (Svartvik 1990 and Nelson et al. 2002) and 421,000 words from the British component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-GB) dating from the early 1990s.

Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions.We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies.",

In this paper copulas are used for the construction of flexible families of models for clustering applications. The use of copulas in model-based clustering offers two direct advantages over current methods: (i) the appropriate choice of copulas provides the ability to obtain a range of exotic shapes for the clusters, and (ii) the explicit choice of marginal distributions for the clusters allows the modelling of multivariate data of various modes (either discrete or continuous) in a natural way. This paper introduces and studies the framework of copula-based finite mixture models for clustering applications. Estimation in the general case can be performed using standard EM, and, depending on the mode of the data, more efficient procedures are provided that can fully exploit the copula structure. The closure properties of the mixture models under marginalization are discussed, and for continuous, real-valued data parametric rotations in the sample space are introduced, with a parallel discussion on parameter identifiability depending on the choice of copulas for the components. The exposition of the methodology is accompanied and motivated by the analysis of real and artificial data.",

Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40% of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.",

All rights reserved.Municipal Solid Waste in general and its organic fraction in particular is a potential renewable and non-seasonal resource. In this work, a life cycle assessment has been performed to evaluate the environmental impacts of two future scenarios using biogas produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) to supply energy to a group of dwellings, respectively comprising distributed generation using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) micro-CHP systems and condensing boilers. The London Borough of Greenwich is taken as the reference case study. The system is designed to assess how much energy demand can be met and what is the best way to use the digestible waste for distributed energy purposes. The system is compared with two alternative scenarios fuelled by natural gas: a reference scenario, where the electricity is supplied by the grid and the heat is supplied from condensing boilers, and a fuel cell micro-CHP system. The results show that, although OFMSW alone can only supply between 1% and 4% of the total energy demand of the Borough, a saving of \u223c130 tonnes of CO2 eq per year per dwelling equipped with micro-CHP is still achievable compared with the reference scenario. This is primarily due to the surplus electricity produced by the fuel cell when the micro-CHP unit is operated to meet the heat demand. Use of biogas to produce heat only is therefore a less desirable option compared with combined heat and power production. Further investigation is required to identify locally available feedstock other than OFMSW in order to increase the proportion of energy demand that can be met in this way.",

Empirical studies indicate that this approach can enhance statistical performance and is computationally feasible. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of its generalization error. We establish for a wide variety of classes of kernels, such as the set of all multivariate Gaussian kernels, that this learning method generalizes well and, when the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen, it is consistent.

Published by Oxford University Press.Hippocampal place cells support spatial memory using sensory information from the environment and self-motion information to localize their firing fields. Currently, there is disagreement about whether CA1 place cells can use pure self-motion information to disambiguate different compartments in environments containing multiple visually identical compartments. Some studies report that place cells can disambiguate different compartments, while others report that they do not. Furthermore, while numerous studies have examined remapping, there has been little examination of remapping in different subregions of a single environment. Is remapping purely local or do place fields in neighboring, unaffected, regions detect the change? We recorded place cells as rats foraged across a 4-compartment environment and report 3 new findings. First, we find that, unlike studies in which rats foraged in 2 compartments, place fields showed a high degree of spatial repetition with a slight degree of rate-based discrimination. Second, this repetition does not diminish with extended experience. Third, remapping was found to be purely local for both geometric change and contextual change. Our results reveal the limited capacity of the path integrator to drive pattern separation in hippocampal representations, and suggest that doorways may play a privileged role in segmenting the neural representation of space.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Purpose: To develop a real-time phase contrast MR sequence with high enough temporal resolution to assess cardiac time intervals. Methods: The sequence utilized spiral trajectories with an acquisition strategy that allowed a combination of temporal encoding (Unaliasing by fourier-encoding the overlaps using the temporal dimension; UNFOLD) and parallel imaging (Sensitivity encoding; SENSE) to be used (UNFOLDed-SENSE). An in silico experiment was performed to determine the optimum UNFOLD filter. In vitro experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of time intervals calculation and peak mean velocity quantification. In addition, 15 healthy volunteers were imaged with the new sequence, and cardiac time intervals were compared to reference standard Doppler echocardiography measures. For comparison, in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments were also carried out using sliding window reconstructions. Results: The in vitro experiments demonstrated good agreement between real-time spiral UNFOLDed-SENSE phase contrast MR and the reference standard measurements of velocity and time intervals. The protocol was successfully performed in all volunteers. Subsequent measurement of time intervals produced values in keeping with literature values and good agreement with the gold standard echocardiography. Importantly, the proposed UNFOLDed-SENSE sequence outperformed the sliding window reconstructions. Conclusion: Cardiac time intervals can be successfully assessed with UNFOLDed-SENSE real-time spiral phase contrast. Real-time MR assessment of cardiac time intervals may be beneficial in assessment of patients with cardiac conditions such as diastolic dysfunction.",

All rights reserved.Background: This study aimed to have international experts converge on a harmonized definition of whole hippocampus boundaries and segmentation procedures, to define standard operating procedures for magnetic resonance (MR)-based manual hippocampal segmentation. Methods: The panel received a questionnaire regarding whole hippocampus boundaries and segmentation procedures. Quantitative information was supplied to allow evidence-based answers. A recursive and anonymous Delphi procedure was used to achieve convergence. Significance of agreement among panelists was assessed by exact probability on Fisher's and binomial tests. Results: Agreement was significant on the inclusion of alveus/fimbria (P 5.021), whole hippocampal tail (P 5.013), medial border of the body according to visible morphology (P 5.0006), and on this combined set of features (P 5.001). This definition captures 100% of hippocampal tissue, 100% of Alzheimer's disease-related atrophy, and demonstrated good reliability on preliminary intrarater (0.98) and inter-rater (0.94) estimates. Discussion: Consensus was achieved among international experts with respect to hippocampal segmentation using MR resulting in a harmonized segmentation protocol.",

Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 or R = 0.6, and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a For central jets at lower pT a Z boson, for 20 \u2264 pjetT < 1000 GeV and pseudorapidities |\u03b7| < 4.5. The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region (|\u03b7| < 1.2) for jets with 55 \u2264 pjetT < 500 GeV. For central jets at lower pT, the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for pjetT > 1 TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet pT balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low-pT jets at |\u03b7| =4.5. Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks or gluons, are also discussed. The magnitude of these uncertainties depends on the event sample used in a given physics analysis, but typically amounts to 0.5\u20133 %.",

This edition pioneered a first day devoted to modeling approaches in biology, which attracted a broad audience of scientists thanks to a panel of renowned speakers. During subsequent days, discussions were held on many subjects including the introduction of new features in the various COMBINE standards, new software tools that use the standards, and outreach efforts. Significant emphasis went into work on extensions of the SBML format, and also into community-building. This year's edition once again demonstrated that the COMBINE community is thriving, and still manages to help coordinate activities between different standards in computational systems biology.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 Edward Denison. All rights reserved.This book explores China's encounter with architecture and modernity in the tumultuous epoch before Communism - an encounter that was mediated not by a singular notion of modernism emanating from the west, but that was uniquely multifarious, deriving from a variety of sources both from the west and, importantly, from the east. The heterogeneous origins of modernity in China are what make its experience distinctive and its architectural encounters exceptional. These experiences are investigated through a re-evaluation of established knowledge of the subject within the wider landscape of modern art practices in China. The study draws on original archival and photographic material from different artistic genres and, architecturally, concentrates on China's engagement with the west through the treaty ports and leased territories, the emergence of architecture as a profession in China, and Japan's omnipresence, not least in Manchuria, which reached its apogee in the puppet state of Manchukuo. The study's geographically, temporally, and architecturally inclusive approach framed by the concept of multiple modernities questions the application of conventional theories of modernity or post-colonialism to the Chinese situation. By challenging conventional modernist historiography that has marginalised the experiences of the west's other for much of the last century, this book proposes different ways of grappling with and comprehending the distinction and complexity of China's experiences and its encounter with architectural modernity.",

Yet the solar wind must ultimately remove plasma from these rapidly rotating magnetodiscs at the same rate that plasma is transported radially outward from the source regions: the Io and Enceladus plasma tori. It is not clear how the solar wind influences magnetospheric dynamics when the dynamics are dominated by rotation. However, auroral observations provide important clues. We review magnetodisc sources and radial transport and the solar wind interaction with the giant magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn in an attempt to connect auroral features with specific drivers. We provide a discussion of auroral signatures that are related to the solar wind interaction and summarize with a discussion of global magnetospheric dynamics as illustrated by global MHD simulations. Many questions remain and it is the intent of this review to highlight several of the most compelling questions for future research.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author.Dopamine is implicated in multiple functions, including motor execution, action learning for hedonically salient outcomes, maintenance, and switching of behavioral response set. Here, we used a novel within-subject psychopharmacological and combined functional neuroimaging paradigm, investigating the interaction between hedonic salience, dopamine, and response set shifting, distinct from effects on action learning or motor execution. We asked whether behavioral performance in response set shifting depends on the hedonic salience of reversal cues, by presenting these as null (neutral) or salient (monetary loss) outcomes. We observed marked effects of reversal cue salience on set-switching, with more efficient reversals following salient loss outcomes. L-Dopa degraded this discrimination, leading to inappropriate perseveration. Generic activation in thalamus, insula, and striatum preceded response set switches, with an opposite pattern in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, the behavioral effect of hedonic salience was reflected in differential vmPFC deactivation following salient relative to null reversal cues. L-Dopa reversed this pattern in vmPFC, suggesting that its behavioral effects are due to disruption of the stability and switching of firing patterns in prefrontal cortex. Our findings provide a potential neurobiological explanation for paradoxical phenomena, including maintenance of behavioral set despite negative outcomes, seen in impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012Inositol serves as a module for the generation of a high level of molecular diversity through the combinatorial attachment and removal of phosphate groups. The array of potential inositol-containing molecules is further expanded by the generation of diphospho inositol polyphosphates, commonly referred as inositol pyrophosphates. All eukaryotic cells possess inositol pyrophosphates containing one or more diphospho- moieties. The metabolism of this class of molecules is highly dynamic, and the enzymes responsible for their metabolism are evolutionary conserved. This new, exciting class of molecules are uniquely chracterized by a high energetic diphospho- bound that is able to participate in phosphotrasfer reactions thereby generating pyrophosphorylation of protein. However, allosteric mechanisms of action have been also proposed. In the past decade several disparate nuclear and cytoplasmic functions have been attributed to inositol pyrophosphates, ranging from intracellular trafficking to telomere length control and from regulating apoptotic process to stimulating insulin secretion. The extraordinary range of cellular function controlled by inositol pyrophosphate underline their great importance.",

Materials capable of affecting the MSC oxygen-sensing pathway, independently of the environmental oxygen pressure, are therefore of immense interest to the tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine community. In this study, we describe the evaluation of the effect of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-stabilizing bioactive glasses (BGs) on human MSCs. The dissolution products from these hypoxia-mimicking BGs stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 in a concentration-dependent manner, altered cell proliferation and metabolism, and upregulated a number of genes involved in the hypoxic response (HIF1A, HIF2A, and VHL), MSC survival (SAG and BCL2), extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP1), and angiogenesis (VEGF and PDGF). These HIF-stabilizing materials can therefore be used to improve MSC survival and enhance regeneration in a number of TE strategies.",

These techniques have been proven reliable and accurate, and as such can be considered in many cases as complementary to experiments. Here I will describe some applications of ab initio techniques to the properties of iron under Earth's core conditions. In particular, I will focus on the description of how to obtain high pressure and high temperature properties, as these are the relevant conditions of interests for the Earth's core. Low temperature properties of solids have often been studied using the quasi-harmonic approximation, which sometimes can retain high accuracy even at temperatures not too far from the melting temperature. However, for solids at high temperature and for liquids the quasi-harmonic approximation fails, and I will describe how using the molecular dynamics technique, coupled with ab initio calculations and the thermodynamic integration scheme, it is possible to compute the high temperature thermodynamic properties of both solids and liquids. Examples of the application of these techniques will include the calculation of many thermodynamic properties of iron and its melting curve, which can be used to improve our understanding of the temperature of the Earth's core.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 UICC.Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still considered the most lethal gynecological malignancy and improved early detection of ovarian cancer is crucial to improving patient prognoses. To address this need, we tested whether candidate EOC biomarkers can be identified using three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models. We quantified changes in the abundance of secreted proteins in a 3D genetic model of early-stage EOC, generated by expressing CMYC and KRASG12V in TERT-immortalized normal ovarian epithelial cells. Cellular proteins were labeled in live cells using stable isotopic amino acid analogues, and secreted proteins identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Thirty-seven and 55 proteins were differentially expressed by CMYC and CMYC+KRASG12V expressing cells respectively (p-\u2030<-\u20300.05; >2-fold). We evaluated expression of the top candidate biomarkers in \u00e2210 primary EOCs: CHI3L1 and FKBP4 are both expressed by >96% of primary EOCs, and FASN and API5 are expressed by 86 and 75% of cases. High expression of CHI3L1 and FKBP4 was associated with worse patient survival (p-\u2030=-\u20300.042 and p-\u2030=-\u20300.002, respectively). Expression of LGALS3BP was positively associated with recurrence (p-\u2030=-\u20300.0001) and suboptimal debulking (p-\u2030=-\u20300.018) suggesting that these proteins may be novel prognostic biomarkers. Furthermore, within early stage tumours (I/II), high expression of API5, CHI3L1 and FASN was associated with high tumour grade (p-\u2030=-\u20303 \u00d7 10-4, p-\u2030=-\u20300.016, p-\u2030=-\u20300.010, respectively). We show in vitro cell biology models of early-stage cancer development can be used to identify novel candidate biomarkers for disease, and report the identification of proteins that represent novel potential candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for this highly lethal disease. What's new? Early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains a substantial clinical challenge. The authors built a 3D in vitro model of early stage EOC by expressing known oncogenes in immortalized primary ovarian epithelial cells. They then quantified changes in abundance of secreted proteins using mass spectrometry at the earliest stages of neoplastic transformation. Candidate biomarkers were followed in >200 primary EOCs, and three (API5, CHI3L1, FASN) were associated with high tumor grade in early-stage EOCs, validating the in vitro approach to in vivo biomarkers for this deadly cancer.",

Continuous manufacturing technologies have long been perceived to be more complex to implement and validate in the biotech sector. However, more recent continuous systems aim to overcome these obstacles with the promise of higher productivities and lower failure rates. This presentation will evaluate the potential of integrated batch and continuous processes via a series of case studies based on the commercial manufacture of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The operational, economic, and environmental feasibility of these technologies is evaluated using a prototype dynamic decision-support tool built at University College London encompassing process economics, discrete-event simulation, and uncertainty analysis so as to enable a holistic assessment. The first case study compares fed-batch culture to two perfusion technologies: spin-filter perfusion and an emerging perfusion technology utilizing alternating tangential flow perfusion reactors. The second case study presents an integrated experimental and modeling approach to evaluate the potential of semicontinuous chromatography for the capture of mAbs in both clinical and commercial manufacture. The final case study provides a wide-ranging overview of the performance of continuous processing relative to the current batch platform for the mAb sector.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.Fast inhibitory signalling in the mammalian brain is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs), which are targets for anti-epileptic therapy such as benzodiazepines. GABAARs undergo tightly regulated trafficking processes that are essential for maintenance and physiological modulation of inhibitory strength. The trafficking of GABAARs to and from the membrane is altered during prolonged seizures such as in Status Epilepticus (SE) and has been suggested to contribute to benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance in patients with SE. However, the intracellular signalling mechanisms that cause this modification in GABAAR trafficking remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the surface stability of GABAARs during SE utilising the low Mg2+ model in hippocampal rat neurons. Live-cell imaging of super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP)-tagged \u03b12 subunit containing GABAARs during low Mg2+ conditions reveals that the somatic surface receptor pool undergoes down-regulation dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity. Analysis of the intracellular Ca2+ signal during low Mg2+ using the Ca2+-indicator Fluo4 shows that this reduction of surface GABAARs correlates well with the timeline of intracellular Ca2+ changes. Furthermore, we show that the activation of the phosphatase calcineurin was required for the decrease in surface GABAARs in neurons undergoing epileptiform activity. These results indicate that somatic modulation of GABAAR trafficking during epileptiform activity in vitro is mediated by calcineurin activation which is linked to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. These mechanisms could account for benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance and the maintenance of recurrent seizure activity, and reveal potential novel targets for the treatment of SE.

            "Abstract": "X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) (OMIM, 300200) is a potentially life-threatening condition that results from mutations in the orphan nuclear receptor, DAX-1. More than 50 different mutations in the DAX1 gene have been reported. DAX1 is expressed in the adrenal gland and at multiple levels throughout the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis. In keeping with this expression pattern, boys with X-linked AHC present with primary adrenal failure in early infancy or childhood and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG) becomes apparent at the expected time of puberty. This form of HHG reflects combined hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, and the gonadotropin response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone is often poor. Impaired spermatogenesis is also observed in Ahch (Dax1) knockout mice. The limited data available to date suggest that DAX-1 may affect Sertoli cell function in humans as well. In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation of patients with X-linked AHC. Several recently reported cases are described that broaden the phenotypic spectrum of this condition and include presentation with adrenal failure in adulthood. The molecular actions of DAX-1 and its pathophysiological role in AHC/HHG are also considered. Finally, future directions for the detection and potential treatment of this condition are proposed.",

Neuroradiol.As we defeat infectious diseases and cancer, one of the greatest medical challenges facing us in the mid-21st century will be the increasing prevalence of degenerative disease. Those diseases, which affect movement and cognition, can be the most debilitating. Dysfunction of the extrapyramidal system results in increasing motor disability often manifest as tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The common pathologic pathway of these diseases, collectively described as parkinsonian syndromes, such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies, is degeneration of the presynaptic dopaminergic pathways in the basal ganglia. Conventional MR imaging is insensitive, especially in early disease, so functional imaging has become the primary method used to differentiate a true parkinsonian syndrome from vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced changes, or essential tremor. Unusually for a modern functional imaging technique, the method most widely used in European clinics depends on SPECT and not PET. This SPECT technique (described in the first of 2 parts) commonly reports dopamine-transporter function, with decreasing striatal uptake demonstrating increasingly severe disease.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 UICC.The aim of this study was to test the utility of AIMP3, an upstream regulator of DNA damage response following genotoxic stress, as a clinical biomarker in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). AIMP3 was identified from a meta-analysis of a global gene-expression dataset. AIMP3 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on a customised bladder cancer tissue-microarray (TMA). The mechanism of gene silencing was probed using methylation-specific PCR. The association between AIMP3 expression, Tp53 transactivity and genomic stability was analysed. In vitro AIMP3 translocation to the nucleus in response to ionising radiation was demonstrated using immunofluorescence. Radiosensitisation effects of siRNA-mediated AIMP3-knockdown were measured using colony forming assays. TMAs derived from patients enrolled in BCON, a Phase III multicentre radiotherapy trial in bladder cancer (ISRCTN45938399) were used to evaluate the association between AIMP3 expression and survival. The prognostic value of AIMP3 expression was determined in a TMA derived from patients treated by radical cystectomy. Loss of AIMP3 expression was frequent in MIBC and associated with impaired Tp53 transactivity and genomic instability. AIMP3-knockdown was associated with an increase in radioresistance. Loss of AIMP3 expression was associated with survival in MIBC patients following radiotherapy (HR=0.53; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.78, p = 0.002) but was not prognostic in the cystectomy set. In conclusion, AIMP3 expression is lost in a subset of bladder cancers and is significantly predictive of survival following radiotherapy in MIBC patients.",

Nevertheless, it remains unknown how the brain processes the sense of self during the multisensory experience of looking at one's face in a mirror. Synchronized visuo-tactile stimulation on one's own and another's face, an experience that is akin to looking in the mirror but seeing another's face, causes the illusory experience of ownership over the other person's face and changes in self-recognition. Here, we investigate the neural correlates of this enfacement illusion using fMRI. We examine activity in the human brain as participants experience tactile stimulation delivered to their face, while observing either temporally synchronous or asynchronous tactile stimulation delivered to another's face on either a specularly congruent or incongruent location. Activity in the multisensory right temporo-parietal junction, intraparietal sulcus, and the unimodal inferior occipital gyrus showed an interaction between the synchronicity and the congruency of the stimulation and varied with the self-reported strength of the illusory experience, which was recorded after each stimulation block. Our results highlight the important interplay between unimodal and multimodal information processing for self-face recognition, and elucidate the neurobiological basis for the plasticity required for identifying with our continuously changing visual appearance.",

Both first-order artificial viscosity and a nonlinear shock capturing term that formally is of second order are considered. For the discretization in time we use the forward Euler method.

Although antenatal imaging findings have been described, the postmortem MRI findings have not been reported. Objective: To present postmortem MRI features of CHAOS. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed our hospital pathology and imaging databases for cases of CHAOS over a 2-year period. Results: We identified two cases of CHAOS. In both cases, postmortem plain radiographs demonstrated gross abdominal distension with distortion and splaying of the rib cage. Both foetuses had characteristic postmortem MRI findings including large-volume fluid-filled lungs on T2-weighted imaging, diaphragmatic eversion, fluid-filled airway dilatation below the level of obstruction, centrally positioned and compressed heart, and massive ascites. One foetus had an associated limb abnormality. Conclusion: Postmortem MRI in foetuses suspected of having CHAOS allows confirmation of the diagnosis, determination of the anatomical level of the atresia or stenosis, and identification of associated abnormalities without the need for invasive autopsy.",

            "Abstract": "Effective application of whole-cell devices in synthetic biology and biocatalysis will always require consideration of the uptake of molecules of interest into the cell. Here we demonstrate that the AlkL protein from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 is an alkane import protein capable of industrially relevant rates of uptake of C 7 -C 16 n-alkanes. Without alkL expression, native E.coli n-alkane uptake was the rate-limiting step in both the whole-cell bioconversion of C 7 -C 16 n-alkanes and in the activation of a whole-cell alkane biosensor by C 10 and C 11 alkanes. By coexpression of alkL as a transporter plug-in, specific yields improved by up to 100-fold for bioxidation of >C 12 alkanes to fatty alcohols and acids. The alkL protein was shown to be toxic to the host when overexpressed but when expressed from a vector capable of controlled induction, yields of alkane oxidation were improved a further 10-fold (8\u00e2 \u20ac...g/L and 1.7\u00e2 \u20ac...g/g of total oxidized products). Further testing of activity on n-octane with the controlled expression vector revealed the highest reported rates of 120\u00e2 \u20ac...1/4mol/min/g and 1\u00e2 \u20ac...g/L/h total oxidized products. This is the first time AlkL has been shown to directly facilitate enhanced uptake of C 10 -C 16 alkanes and represents the highest reported gain in product yields resulting from its use.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a92014 AACR.Purpose: Biomarkers for the early detection of pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether increased levels of serum CA19-9, CA125, CEACAM1, and REG3A are present before clinical presentation of pancreatic cancer and to assess the performance of combined markers for early detection and prognosis. Experimental Design: This nested case-control study within the UKCTOCS included 118 single and 143 serial serum samples from 154 postmenopausal women who were subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 304 matched noncancer controls. Samples were split randomly into independent training and test sets. CA19-9, CA125, CEACAM1, and REG3A were measured using ELISA and/or CLIA. Performance of markers to detect cancers at different times before diagnosis and for prognosis was evaluated. Results: At 95% specificity, CA19-9 (>37 U/mL) had a sensitivity of 68% up to 1 year, and 53% up to 2 years before diagnosis. Combining CA19-9 and CA125 improved sensitivity as CA125 was elevated (>30 U/mL) in approximately 20% of CA19-9-negative cases. CEACAM1 and REG3A were late markers adding little in combined models. Average lead times of 20 to 23 months were estimated for test-positive cases. Prediagnostic levels of CA19-9 and CA125 were associated with poor overall survival (HR, 2.69 and 3.15, respectively). Conclusions: CA19-9 and CA125 have encouraging sensitivity for detecting preclinical pancreatic cancer, and both markers can be used as prognostic tools. This work challenges the prevailing view that CA19-9 is upregulated late in the course of pancreatic cancer development.",

Considering the differentiation potential in vitro toward cell lineages belonging to the three germ layers, AFS cells have raised great interest as a new therapeutic tool, but their immune properties still need to be assessed. We analyzed the in vitro immunological properties of AFS cells from different gestational age in coculture with T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. Nonactivated (resting) first trimester-AFS cells showed lower expression of HLA class-I molecules and NK-activating ligands than second and third trimester-AFS cells, whose features were associated with lower sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis. Nevertheless, inflammatory priming with interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) enhanced resistance of all AFS cell types to NK cytotoxicity. AFS cells modulated lymphocyte proliferation in a different manner according to gestational age: first trimester-AFS cells significantly inhibited T and NK cell proliferation, while second and third trimester-AFS cells were less efficient. In addition, only inflammatory-primed second trimester-AFS cells could suppress B cell proliferation, which was not affected by the first and third trimester-AFS cells. Indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase pathway was significantly involved only in T cell suppression mediated by second and third trimester-AFS cells. Overall, this study shows a number of significant quantitative differences among AFS cells of different gestational age that have to be considered in view of their clinical application.",

We introduce the tracial rank of a graph, a parameter that gives a lower bound for the commuting quantum chromatic number and parallels the projective rank, and prove that it is multiplicative. We describe the tracial rank, the projective rank and the fractional chromatic numbers in a unified manner that clarifies their connection with the commuting quantum chromatic number, the quantum chromatic number and the classical chromatic number, respectively.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 The Author.Sensory input evokes low-order reflexes and higher-order perceptual responses. Vestibular stimulation elicits vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) and self-motion perception (e.g., vertigo) whose response durations are normally equal. Adaptation to repeated whole-body rotations, for example, ballet training, is known to reduce vestibular responses. We investigated the neuroanatomical correlates of vestibular perceptuo-reflex adaptation in ballet dancers and controls. Dancers' vestibular-reflex and perceptual responses to whole-body yaw-plane step rotations were: (1) Briefer and (2) uncorrelated (controls' reflex and perception were correlated). Voxel-based morphometry showed a selective gray matter (GM) reduction in dancers' vestibular cerebellum correlating with ballet experience. Dancers' vestibular cerebellar GM density reduction was related to shorter perceptual responses (i.e. positively correlated) but longer VOR duration (negatively correlated). Contrastingly, controls' vestibular cerebellar GM density negatively correlated with perception and VOR. Diffusion-tensor imaging showed that cerebral cortex white matter (WM) microstructure correlated with vestibular perception but only in controls. In summary, dancers display vestibular perceptuo-reflex dissociation with the neuronatomical correlate localized to the vestibular cerebellum. Controls' robust vestibular perception correlated with a cortical WM network conspicuously absent in dancers. Since primary vestibular afferents synapse in the vestibular cerebellum, we speculate that a cerebellar gating of perceptual signals to cortical regions mediates the training-related attenuation of vestibular perception and perceptuo-reflex uncoupling.",

In this work we begin by providing an overview of forward modelling methods, before deriving a linearised diffusion-style model which calculates the first-harmonic modulated flux measured on the boundary of a given domain. We derive and examine the correlation measurement density functions of the model which describe the sensitivity of the modality to perturbations in the optical parameters of interest. Finally, we employ said functions in the development of an adjoint-assisted gradient based image reconstruction method, which ameliorates the computational burden and memory requirements of a traditional Newton-based optimisation approach. We validate our work by performing reconstructions of optical absorption and scattering in two- and three-dimensions using simulated measurements with 1% proportional Gaussian noise, and demonstrate the successful recovery of the parameters to within \u00b15% of their true values when the resolution of the ultrasound raster probing the domain is sufficient to delineate perturbing inclusions.",

Aims: The current study investigates how people with persecutory delusions interpret events in a virtual neutral social environment using qualitative methodology. Method: 20 participants with persecutory delusions and 20 controls entered a virtual underground train containing neutral characters. Under these circumstances, people with persecutory delusions reported similar levels of paranoia as non-clinical participants. The transcripts of a post-virtual reality interview of the first 10 participants in each group were analysed. Results: Thematic analyses of interviews focusing on the decision making process associated with attributing intentions of computer-generated characters revealed 11 themes grouped in 3 main categories (evidence in favour of paranoid appraisals, evidence against paranoid appraisals, other behaviour). Conclusions: People with current persecutory delusions are able to use a range of similar strategies to healthy volunteers when making judgements about potential threat in a neutral environment that does not elicit anxiety, but they are less likely than controls to engage in active hypothesis-testing and instead favour experiencing affect as evidence of persecutory intention.",

            "Abstract": "Background Active recall can improve reattendance rates and could increase retesting rates and detection of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but the best strategy remains uncertain. Methods We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of active recall for HIV and/or STI testing. We searched six electronic databases using terms for HIV, STIs, tests and active recall (defined as a reminder to retest for HIV/STIs) for randomised, non-randomised and observational English-language studies published between 1983 and 2013. Outcomes included reattendance/retesting rate and STI diagnosis at follow-up. Results Of 5634 papers identified, 17 met the inclusion criteria. Of the 14 comparative studies, all but one demonstrated higher reattendance/retesting rates in the intervention group, but the range was wide (17.5-89%). Meta-analysis of nine RCTs found reattendance/retesting rates were significantly higher in the intervention versus control groups (pooled OR 2.42 (95% CI 1.84 to 3.19)). In a subgroup analysis, home sampling increased retesting compared with clinic testing (pooled OR 2.20 (95% CI 1.65 to 2.94)). In observational studies SMS reminders increased retesting compared with standard clinic care (pooled OR 2.19 (95% CI 1.46 to 3.29)), but study estimates were highly heterogeneous (I2=94%, p<0.001). Conclusions Active recall interventions are associated with higher reattendance/retesting rates for HIV/STI. Although home sampling and SMS reminders were associated with higher reattendance/retesting rates in most studies, evidence is limited by the heterogeneity of interventions and control groups and the quality of studies. Further work is needed to explore which active recall modality is clinically cost-effective and acceptable for HIV/STI screening.",

The accounts of British visitors between 1738 and the end of the century reflect a new historical sensibility, one predicated upon the extraordinary proximity between present and past that these sites seemed to promise. In this essay, Charlotte Roberts examines the work of four individuals - Camillo Paderni, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Sir William Hamilton - all of whom used the prevailing vocabulary associated with Herculaneum and Pompeii in order to articulate individual and in several cases innovative arguments on subjects as diverse as the validity of Neapolitan Bourbon rule, the ideal of Greek art, and the history of the earth. Their ideas indicate that these excavations, in a small but significant way, helped to shape a diverse range of eighteenth-century thought.",

They provide a brief overview of the key theoretical ideas and practices in narrative therapy. Narrative therapy was initially developed by Michael White and David Epston and has evolved from a synthesis of diverse influences. The ideas of various social sciences theorists and poststructuralist philosophers, in particular Foucault, have been instrumental in the development of narrative theory. Narrative therapy\u2019s challenge of dominant discourses and taken-for-granted realities makes it an appealing approach for therapeutic work with people who collectively have been marginalized and stigmatized like few others. The authors conclude by addressing some questions that the reader might have about using this approach and offer some personal reflections on the effects of incorporating narrative therapy into our own work.",

Better performance was found with higher luminance and larger task size, but with diminishing returns according to a plateau-escarpment relationship. The results were used to estimate appropriate light levels for outdoor lighting. Results for judgements of emotion from facial expression suggest a minimum luminance of the face of 0.1-1.0 cd/m<sup>2</sup> if facial expressions are to be identified accurately at 4 m, but a luminance above 1.0 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for identification at 10 m.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: Dysthymia is a depressive disorder of chronic nature but of lower severity than major depression. Depressive symptoms are more or less continuous for at least two years. Patients with this disorder experience considerable social dysfunction and disability and are more likely than the general population to use general medical services and to take non-specific psychotropic drugs. Examining the use of pharmacotherapy for this condition is of critical importance. Objectives: The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials comparing drugs and placebo for the treatment of dysthymia. Search methods: Electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, biological abstracts and LILACS; reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry; book chapters on the treatment of depression. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials that focused on the use of drugs versus placebo for dysthymic patients were included. Exclusion criteria were: non-randomised controlled trials, a mixture of major depression and dysthymia (trials not providing separate data) and depression secondary to other disorders (e.g. substance abuse). Data collection and analysis: The reviewers extracted the data independently. In order to achieve an intention-to-treat analysis it was assumed, when not reported in the trial, that people who died or dropped out had no improvement. Authors of relevant trials were contacted for additional and missing data. Absence of treatment response as defined by authors was the main measure of outcome used. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of dichotomous data were calculated with the random-effects model. Where possible, number needed to treat and number needed to harm were estimated, taking the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. Main results: Currently the review includes 29 trials, 17 reporting data for the main outcome measures. Similar results were obtained in terms of efficacy for different groups of drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and other drugs (sulpiride, amineptine, and ritanserin). The pooled relative risk for absence of treatment response was 0.68 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.78) for tricyclic antidepressants and the number needed to treat was 4.3 (95% CI 3.2 to 6.5). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed similar relative risk for this outcome: 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.82), the number needed to treat was 5 (95% CI 3.3 to 9). Concerning monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) and the number needed to treat was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2 to 4.3). Other drugs (amisulpiride, amineptine and ritanserin) showed similar results in terms of absence of treatment response. Using more stringent criteria for improvement, i.e. full remission, the results were unchanged. Patients treated on tricyclic antidepressants were more likely to report adverse events, compared with placebo. Authors' conclusions: Drugs are effective in the treatment of dysthymia with no differences between and within drug classes. Tricyclic antidepressants are more likely to cause adverse events and dropouts. As dysthymia is a chronic condition, there remains little information on quality of life and medium or long-term outcome.",

Although tremendous progress has been made in uncovering molecular and cellular mechanisms implicated in interneuron generation and function, several questions still remain open. Rho-GTPases have been implicated as intracellular mediators of numerous developmental processes such as cytoskeleton organization, vesicle trafficking, transcription, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Specifically in cortical interneurons, we have recently shown a cell-autonomous and stage-specific requirement for Rac1 activity within proliferating interneuron precursors. Conditional ablation of Rac1 in the medial ganglionic eminence leads to a 50% reduction of GABAergic interneurons in the postnatal cortex. Here we examine the additional role of Rac3 by analyzing Rac1/Rac3 double-mutant mice. We show that in the absence of both Rac proteins, the embryonic migration of medial ganglionic eminence-derived interneurons is further impaired. Postnatally, double-mutant mice display a dramatic loss of cortical interneurons. In addition, Rac1/Rac3-deficient interneurons show gross cytoskeletal defects in vitro, with the length of their leading processes significantly reduced and a clear multipolar morphology. We propose that in the absence of Rac1/Rac3, cortical interneurons fail to migrate tangentially towards the pallium due to defects in actin and microtubule cytoskeletal dynamics.",

GHz towards a sample of nearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarization fractions p and angles \u03c8. The polarization fractions and column densities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of values obtained over the whole sky. We find that: (i) the largest polarization fractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarization fraction p<inf>max</inf> decreases with column density N<inf>H</inf> in the more opaque fields with N<inf>H</inf>> 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>; and (iii) the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with the local spatial coherence of the polarization angle. These observations are compared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamical turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsic polarization fraction of the dust grains. We find that an estimate of this parameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction p<inf>max</inf> in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered on large scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. This emphasizes the impact of anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. The decrease of the maximum polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecular clouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentially due to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation of variously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such an anti-correlation. In the simulations, polarization fractions are also found to anti-correlate with the angle dispersion function S. However, the dispersion of the polarization angle for a given polarization fraction is found to be larger in the simulations than in the observations, suggesting a shortcoming in the physical content of these numerical models. In summary, we find that the turbulent structure of the magnetic field is able to reproduce the main statistical properties of the dust polarization as observed in a variety of nearby clouds, dense cores excluded, and that the large-scale field orientation with respect to the line of sight plays a major role in the quantitative analysis of these statistical properties.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Optical Society of America.Schlieren [Schlieren and Shadowgraphy Techniques (McGraw-Hill, 2001); Optics of Flames (Butterworths, 1963)] is a non-intrusive technique that can be used to detect density variations in a medium, and thus, under constant pressure and mixture concentration conditions, measure whole-field temperature distributions. The objective of the current work was to design a schlieren system to measure line-of-sight (LOS)-averaged temperature distribution with the final aim to determine the temperature distribution inside the cylinder of internal combustion (IC) engines. In a preliminary step, we assess theoretically the errors arising from the data reduction used to determine temperature from a schlieren measurement and find that the total error, random and systematic, is less than 3% for typical conditions encountered in the present experiments. A Z-type, curved-mirror schlieren system was used to measure the temperature distribution from a hot air jet in an open air environment in order to evaluate the method. Using the Abel transform, the radial distribution of the temperature was reconstructed from the LOS measurements. There was good agreement in the peak temperature between the reconstructed schlieren and thermocouple measurements. Experiments were then conducted in a four-stroke, single-cylinder, optical spark ignition engine with a four-valve, pentroof-type cylinder head to measure the temperature distribution of the reaction zone of an iso-octane-air mixture. The engine optical windows were designed to produce parallel rays and allow accurate application of the technique. The feasibility of the method to measure temperature distributions in IC engines was evaluated with simulations of the deflection angle combined with equilibrium chemistry calculations that estimated the temperature of the reaction zone at the position of maximum ray deflection as recorded in a schlieren image. Further simulations showed that the effects of exhaust gas recirculation and air-to-fuel ratio on the schlieren images were minimal under engine conditions compared to the temperature effect. At 20 crank angle degrees before top dead center (i.e., 20 crank angle degrees after ignition timing), the measured temperature of the flame front was in agreement with the simulations (730-1320 K depending on the shape of the flame front). Furthermore, the schlieren images identified the presence of hot gases ahead of the reaction zone due to diffusion and showed that there were no hot spots in the unburned mixture.",

Multiple methods of modelling these foregrounds with varying levels of assumption have been trialled and shown promising recoveries on simulated data. Recently however there has been increased discussion of using the expected shape of the foregrounds in Fourier space to define an EoR window free of foreground contamination. By carrying out analysis within this window only, one can avoid the foregrounds and any statistical bias they might introduce by instead removing these foregrounds. In this paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both foreground removal and foreground avoidance. We create a series of simulations with noise levels in line with both current and future experiments and compare the recovered statistical cosmological signal from foreground avoidance and a simplified, frequency independent foreground removal model. We find that for current generation experiments, while foreground avoidance enables a better recovery at kperp > 0.6 Mpc-1, foreground removal is able to recover significantly more signal at small klos for both current and future experiments. We also relax the assumption that the foregrounds are smooth. For line-of-sight variations only, foreground removal is able to make a good signal recovery even at 1 per cent while foreground avoidance is compromised significantly. We find that both methods perform well for foreground models with line-of-sight and spatial variations around 0.1 per cent however at levels larger than this both methods are compromised.",

This is further complicated by unit and item nonresponse for which a number of methods have been developed in order to reduce estimation bias. In this paper, we address some issues that arise when the target of the inference (i.e. the analysis model or model of interest) is the conditional quantile of a continuous outcome. Survey design variables are duly included in the analysis and a bootstrap variance estimation approach is proposed. Missing data are multiply imputed by means of chained equations. In particular, imputation of continuous variables is based on their empirical distribution, conditional on all other variables in the analysis. This method preserves the distributional relationships in the data, including conditional skewness and kurtosis, and successfully handles bounded outcomes. Our motivating study concerns the analysis of birthweight determinants in a large UK-based cohort of children. A novel finding on the parental conflict theory is reported.

Recent findings from basic neuroscience have shed fresh light on these old problems. New insights provided by clinical neuroscience concerning the effects of brain disorders promise to be particularly valuable in uncovering the underlying cognitive and neural architecture of music and for assessing candidate accounts of the biological role of music. Here we advance a new model of the biological role of music in human evolution and the link to brain disorders, drawing on diverse lines of evidence derived from comparative ethology, cognitive neuropsychology and neuroimaging studies in the normal and the disordered brain. We propose that music evolved from the call signals of our hominid ancestors as a means mentally to rehearse and predict potentially costly, affectively laden social routines in surrogate, coded, low-cost form: essentially, a mechanism for transforming emotional mental states efficiently and adaptively into social signals. This biological role of music has its legacy today in the disordered processing of music and mental states that characterizes certain developmental and acquired clinical syndromes of brain network disintegration.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014.Background. Chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with immunosenescence and immunoactivation in the general population. In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected people, CMV coinfection, in addition to residual HIV replication and microbial translocation, has been proposed as a key factor in sustaining immune activation, even in individuals with a controlled HIV load. Methods. Patients from the ICONA Study with at least 1 CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) test available without active CMV disease were included in the analysis. AIDS-defining event or AIDS-related death and severe non- AIDS-defining event or non-AIDS-related death were taken as clinical progression end points. Independent predictors of CMV were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Probabilities of reaching the end points were estimated by survival analyses. Results. A total of 6111 subjects were included, of whom 5119 (83.3%) were CMV IgG positive at baseline. Patients with CMV IgG positivity at baseline were more likely to develop a severe non-AIDS-defining event/ non-AIDS-related death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.53 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.08-2.16]. In particular, CMV seropositivity was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (adjusted HR, 2.27 [95% CI, .97-5.32]). Conclusions. In our study population, CMV/HIV coinfection was associated with the risk of severe non- AIDS-defining events/non-AIDS-related death, especially with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, independently of other prognostic factors. This finding supports a potential independent role of CMV coinfection in vascular/degenerative organ disorders in HIV-infected subjects.",

Studies have demonstrated the involvement of mutations or common variants of the gene encoding Eph receptor A2 (EPHA2), in congenital cataract and in age-related cataract. This study investigated a number of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EPHA2 in patients with age-related cataract.Materials and methods: The study included 491 Estonian patients who had surgery for age-related cataract, classified as nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular and mixed lens opacities, and 185 controls of the same ethnical origin. Seven SNPs in EPHA2 (rs7543472, rs11260867, rs7548209, rs3768293, rs6603867, rs6678616, rs477558) were genotyped using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination. Statistical analyses for single factor associations used \u03c72-test and logistic regression was performed including relevant covariates (age, sex and smoking).Results: In single-SNP allele analysis, only the rs7543472 showed a borderline significant association with risk of cataract (p = 0.048). Regression analysis with known risk factors for cataract showed no significant associations of the studied SNPs with cataract. Stratification by cataract subtype did not alter the results. Adjusted odds ratios were between 0.82 and 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.61-1.60).Conclusions: The present study does not support a major role of EphA2 in cataractogenesis in an Estonian population.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The British Psychological Society.Objectives Behaviour change technique (BCT) Taxonomy v1 is a hierarchically grouped, consensus-based taxonomy of 93 BCTs for reporting intervention content. To enhance the use and understanding of BCTs, the aims of the present study were to (1) quantitatively examine the 'bottom-up' hierarchical structure of Taxonomy v1, (2) identify whether BCTs can be reliably mapped to theoretical domains using a 'top-down' theoretically driven approach, and (3) identify any overlap between the 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' groupings. Methods and design The 'bottom-up' structure was examined for higher-order groupings using a dendrogram derived from hierarchical cluster analysis. For the theory-based 'top-down' structure, 18 experts sorted BCTs into 14 theoretical domains. Discriminant Content Validity was used to identify groupings, and chi-square tests and Pearson's residuals were used to examine the overlap between groupings. Results Behaviour change techniques relating to 'Reward and Punishment' and 'Cues and Cue Responses' were perceived as markedly different to other BCTs. Fifty-nine of the BCTs were reliably allocated to 12 of the 14 theoretical domains; 47 were significant and 12 were of borderline significance. Thirty-four of 208 'bottom-up' \u00d7 'top-down' pairings showed greater overlap than expected by chance. However, only six combinations achieved satisfactory evidence of similarity. Conclusions The moderate overlap between the groupings indicates some tendency to implicitly conceptualize BCTs in terms of the same theoretical domains. Understanding the nature of the overlap will aid the conceptualization of BCTs in terms of theory and application. Further research into different methods of developing a hierarchical taxonomic structure of BCTs for international, interdisciplinary work is now required. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Behaviour change interventions are effective in improving health care and health outcomes. The 'active' components of these interventions are behaviour change techniques and over 93 have been identified. Taxonomies of behaviour change techniques require structure to enable potential applications. What does this study add? This study identifies groups of BCTs to aid the recall of BCTs for intervention coding and design. It compares two methods of grouping - 'bottom-up' and theory-based 'top-down' - and finds a moderate overlap. Building on identified BCT groups, it examines relationships between theoretical domains and BCTs.",

            "Abstract": "Objectives: We report the use of difference in differences (DiD) methodology to evaluate a complex, system-wide healthcare intervention. We use the worked example of evaluating the Marie Curie Delivering Choice Programme (DCP) for advanced illness in a large urban healthcare economy. Methods: DiD was selected because a randomised controlled trial was not feasible. The method allows for before and after comparison of changes that occur in an intervention site with a matched control site. This enables analysts to control for the effect of the intervention in the absence of a local control. Any policy, seasonal or other confounding effects over the test period are assumed to have occurred in a balanced way at both sites. Data were obtained from primary care trusts. Outcomes were place of death, inpatient admissions, length of stay and costs. Results: Small changes were identified between pre- and post-DCP outputs in the intervention site. The proportion of home deaths and median cost increased slightly, while the number of admissions per patient and the average length of stay per admission decreased slightly. None of these changes was statistically significant. Conclusions: Effects estimates were limited by small numbers accessing new services and selection bias in sample population and comparator site. In evaluating the effect of a complex healthcare intervention, the choice of analysis method and output measures is crucial. Alternatives to randomised controlled trials may be required for evaluating large scale complex interventions and the DiD approach is suitable, subject to careful selection of measured outputs and control population.",

All rights reserved.Background: To define the burden of hospitalization due to 2 vaccine-preventable infections, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and varicella zoster (VZ), among HIV-infected children in the UK and Ireland. Methods: Analysis of hospitalizations of HIV-infected children <18 years receiving pediatric care and reported to the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study (CHIPS) between 1996 and 2011. Results: Admissions for IPD and VZ combined accounted for \u223c5% of all hospital admissions for HIV-infected children each year. When compared with background rates for healthy children, the admission rate ratio for HIV-infected children on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was 16.7, 14.8 and 126.7 for IPD, varicella and herpes zoster, respectively, and 156.7, 86.1 and 470, respectively, for HIV-infected children not on cART. Those admitted with IPD or VZ were more likely to have Centers for Disease Control stage B/C at presentation with HIV than those without such admissions (36.8% for IPD, 29.7% for VZ and 22.1% for no IPD or VZ, P = 0.006), and were more likely to subsequently commence cART (94.7%, 91.3% and 80.2% respectively, P = 0.004). Conclusions: There is a clear increased risk of admission with IPD or VZ in HIV-infected compared with uninfected children, magnified in those who have not yet commenced cART. It is anticipated that the introduction of new guidelines will result in improved vaccine uptake and thereby reduce the burden of IPD and VZ disease. Subsequent evaluation will assess the impact of these guidelines.",

Suppose that there is a solution such that for all sufficiently large n, and the height of yn dominates the height of the coefficient functions an, bn and cn. We show that if the logarithmic height of yn grows no faster than a power of n then either the equation is a well known discrete Painlev\u00e9 equation dPII or its autonomous version or yn is also an admissible solution of a discrete Riccati equation. This provides further evidence that slow height growth is a good detector of integrability.",

The problems are:1.Passive observations in spacetime: consider observations in an open set V\u2282 M. The light observation set corresponding to a point source at q\u2208 M is the intersection of V and the light-cone emanating from the point q.Let W\u2282 M be an unknown open, relatively compact set. We show that under natural causality conditions, the family of light observation sets corresponding to point sources at points q\u2208 W determine uniquely the conformal type of W.2.Active measurements in spacetime: we develop a new method for inverse problems for non-linear hyperbolic equations that utilizes the non-linearity as a tool. This enables us to solve inverse problems for non-linear equations for which the corresponding problems for linear equations are still unsolved. To illustrate this method, we solve an inverse problem for semilinear wave equations with quadratic non-linearities. We assume that we are given the neighborhood V of the time-like path \u03bc and the source-to-solution operator that maps the source supported on V to the restriction of the solution of the wave equation to V. When M is 4-dimensional, we show that these data determine the topological, differentiable, and conformal structures of the spacetime in the maximal set where waves can propagate from \u03bc and return back to \u03bc.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.At present, the codified procedures for the seismic assessment of existing structures do not consider explicitly the use of sensitivity analysis that, on the contrary, is an essential tool due to the intrinsic and epistemic uncertainties involved. In particular, results of a sensitivity analysis allow, on one hand, to optimize the plan of investigations and tests, limiting it to what is really useful, and, on the other hand, to be aware of the propagation of uncertainties in the final outcome of the assessment. The paper proposes how to implement the sensitivity analysis in a systemic way, in order to define proper confidence factors, which are used within the semi-probabilistic approach of the performance-based assessment procedure. In relation to the procedures adopted by current standards, this method is aimed to overcome the following drawbacks: (1) the a priori definition of values for the confidence factor; (2) the a priori selection of parameters to which confidence factor has to be applied; (3) the weak connection between investigation and assessment. Despite the generality of most aspects of the proposed procedure, main attention is given in the paper to its application in the case of masonry existing buildings and, in particular, of those with a significant cultural value, where the minimization of invasiveness of investigations on the construction together with that of costs plays a crucial role for the aim of conservation.",

The Born-Oppenheimer (BO) ab initio grid points of Pavanello et al. [J. Chem. Phys.136, 184303 (2012)] are refitted as BOPES75K, which reproduces the energies below dissociation with a root mean square deviation of 0.05 cm\u22121; points between dissociation and 75,000 cm\u22121 are reproduced with the average accuracy of a few wavenumbers. The new PES75K+ potential combines BOPES75K with adiabatic, relativistic and quantum electrodynamics (QED) surfaces to provide the most accurate representation of the H+3 global potential to date, overcoming the limitations on previous high accuracy H+3 PESs near and above dissociation. PES75K+ can be used to provide predictions of bound rovibrational energy levels with an accuracy of approaching 0.1 cm\u22121. Calculation of rovibrational energy levels within PES75K+ suggests that the non-adiabatic correction remains a limiting factor. The PES is also constructed to give the correct asymptotic limit making it suitable for use in studies of the H++H2 prototypical chemical reaction. An improved dissociation energy for H+3 is derived as D0=35,076 \u00b1 2cm\u22121.",

All rights reserved.Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is a novel technique that has evolved over the years to address the challenges of low rectal cancer surgery by applying the principles and benefits of laparoscopic surgery to more historic transanal techniques. It has been popularized through its use in rectal cancer, but the transanal approach is slowly being expanded to tackle different clinical scenarios including benign conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and endometriosis. For all of these new indications, it is the desire to access and begin the dissection in native tissue beyond the pathology which makes this approach applicable to other diseases where anatomy can be challenging. Training pathways to safely introduce taTME in a standardized manner are being developed and implemented in a bid to ensure adequate training to all the surgeons using this technique and thus minimize complications and patient morbidity. The future directions of this promising technique include the use of image and optical technological enhancement to aid navigation, the use of pneumorectum stabilization, and perhaps the use of fluorescence as a safety improvement. Developments have come also from the field of robotics. After a demonstration of feasibility in cadaver models, a growing experience has been gathered in the robotic approach to taTME, covered in the last part of this chapter.",

It can be treated with bypass surgery, but due to the limited availability of autologous grafts, there has been research into developing a completely tissue-engineered vascular graft. Our group has developed a small diameter, biodegradable nanocomposite graft which is non-thrombogenic and biostable. Objectives: This study looks at the eff ects of the growth factors, TGF-\u03b2 1 and BMP-4 on bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC) morphology on a POSS PCL scaff old. Materials and methods: BMSCs were seeded onto a new nanocomposite of POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) and PCL (poly[caprolactone-urea]urethane) and TGF-\u03b2 1 and BMP-4 were used to induce diff erentiation of the cells to smooth muscle cells. The distribution of the cells was examined using confocal and electron microscopies and the phenotype of the cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Results: It was found that growth factor induction led to a decrease in cell growth on POSS PCL as compared to that of the control surface, and confocal microscopic analysis showed less cytoskeleton reorganization of these cells. After immunohistochemistry analysis, the BMSCs showed no diff erentiation to smooth muscle cells. Discussion: Growth factor induction on the static scaff old discs led to a change in morphology, with less spreading of the cells, a lower proliferation rate and no diff erentiation into SMCs. These fi ndings can be attributed to the POSS PCL being manufactured by a coagulation technique, resulting in a structure with low stiff ness.",

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare ciliopathy characterized by retinal dystrophy, obesity, intellectual disability, polydactyly, hypogonadism and renal impairment. Patients are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Mutations in BBS1 and BBS10 account for more than half of those with molecular confirmation of the diagnosis. To elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations with respect to cardiovascular risk indicators 50 patients with mutations in BBS1 were compared with 19 patients harbouring BBS10 mutations. All patients had truncating, missense or compound missense/truncating mutations. The effect of genotype and mutation type was analysed. C-reactive protein was higher in those with mutations in BBS10 and homozygous truncating mutations (p=0.013 and p=0.002, respectively). Patients with mutations in BBS10 had higher levels of C peptide than those with mutations in BBS1 (p=0.043). Triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in patients with homozygous truncating mutations (p=0.048). Gamma glutamyl transferase was higher in patients with homozygous truncating mutations (p=0.007) and heterozygous missense and truncating mutations (p=0.002) than those with homozygous missense mutations. The results are compared with clinical cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with missense mutations in BBS1 have lower biochemical cardiovascular disease markers compared with patients with BBS10 and other BBS1 mutations. This could contribute to stratification of the clinical service.",

SUMMARY ANSWER: The 13th retrospective collection represents valuable data on PGD/PGS cycles, pregnancies and children: the main trend observed is the decrease in the routine implementation of PGS. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Since 1999, the PGD Consortium has collected, analysed and published 12 data sets and an overview of the first 10 years of data collections. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data were collected from each participating centre using a FileMaker Pro database (versions 5-11). Separate predesigned FileMaker Pro files were used for the cycles, pregnancies and baby records. The study documented cycles performed during the calendar year 2010 and follow-up of the pregnancies and babies born which resulted from these cycles (until October 2011). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data were submitted by 62 centres (full PGD Consortium members). The submitted data were thoroughly analysed to identify incomplete data entries and corrections were requested from the participating centres. Records remaining with incomplete or inconsistent data were excluded from the calculations. Corrections, calculations and tables were made by expert co-authors. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: For data collection XIII, 62 centres reported data for 5780 cycles with oocyte retrieval (OR), along with details of the follow-up on 1503 pregnancies and 1152 babies born. A total of 1071 OR were reported for chromosomal abnormalities, 108 OR for sexing for X-linked diseases, 1574 OR for monogenic diseases, 2979 OR for preimplantation genetic screening and 48 OR for social sexing. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The findings apply to the 62 participating centres and may not represent worldwide trends in PGD. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The annual data collections provide an important resource for data mining and for following trends in PGD practice. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.The aim of this study is to evaluate the brainstem function in DYT1 carriers manifesting clinical dystonia (MDYT1) and those without clinical symptoms (NMDYT1). Motor cortical inhibition and plasticity were found to be abnormal in MDYT1, whereas these were less abnormal in NMDYT1. However, the spinal reciprocal inhibition was abnormal in MDYT1, but normal in NMDYT1. Moreover, protein accumulation and perinuclear inclusion bodies were found in the brainstem, but not in other brain areas, in DYT1 patients. Therefore, we designed this study to investigate the brainstem physiology using the blink reflex (BR) recovery cycle test in MDYT1 and NMDYT1. We recruited eight MDYT1, five NMDYT1, and nine age-matched healthy controls. The BR recovery cycle was assessed with paired stimuli that induced the BR in a random order at interstimulus intervals of 250, 500, and 1000 ms. A two-way analysis of variance showed a significant difference between MDYT1, NMDYT1, and the healthy control (P=0.004). Post-hoc analysis showed that this was because of a significantly lower inhibition of R2 in MDYT1 and NMDYT1 compared with the controls (two-way analysis of variance: P=0.003 and 0.021, respectively). There was no difference between MDYT1 and NMDYT1 (P=0.224). The tested brainstem circuits were equally involved in MDYT1 and NMDYT1. The finding is in agreement with the pathological findings in DYT1 carriers. Together with previous findings in the motor cortex and the spinal cord, the brainstem may lie closer to the pathogenesis of dystonia than the motor cortex in DYT1 gene carriers.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Author (2015). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare disorder caused by de novo mutations in the ATP1A3 gene, expressed in neurons and cardiomyocytes. As affected individuals may survive into adulthood, we use the term 'alternating hemiplegia'. The disorder is characterized by early-onset, recurrent, often alternating, hemiplegic episodes; seizures and non-paroxysmal neurological features also occur. Dysautonomia may occur during hemiplegia or in isolation. Premature mortality can occur in this patient group and is not fully explained. Preventable cardiorespiratory arrest from underlying cardiac dysrhythmia may be a cause. We analysed ECG recordings of 52 patients with alternating hemiplegia from nine countries: all had whole-exome, whole-genome, or direct Sanger sequencing of ATP1A3. Data on autonomic dysfunction, cardiac symptoms, medication, and family history of cardiac disease or sudden death were collected. All had 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings available for cardiac axis, cardiac interval, repolarization pattern, and J-point analysis. Where available, historical and prolonged single-lead electrocardiogram recordings during electrocardiogram-videotelemetry were analysed. Half the cohort (26/52) had resting 12-lead electrocardiogram abnormalities: 25/26 had repolarization (T wave) abnormalities. These abnormalities were significantly more common in people with alternating hemiplegia than in an age-matched disease control group of 52 people with epilepsy. The average corrected QT interval was significantly shorter in people with alternating hemiplegia than in the disease control group. J wave or J-point changes were seen in six people with alternating hemiplegia. Over half the affected cohort (28/52) had intraventricular conduction delay, or incomplete right bundle branch block, a much higher proportion than in the normal population or disease control cohort (P = 0.0164). Abnormalities in alternating hemiplegia were more common in those 16 years old, compared with those <16 (P = 0.0095), even with a specific mutation (p.D801N; P = 0.045). Dynamic, beat-to-beat or electrocardiogram-to-electrocardiogram, changes were noted, suggesting the prevalence of abnormalities was underestimated. Electrocardiogram changes occurred independently of seizures or plegic episodes. Electrocardiogram abnormalities are common in alternating hemiplegia, have characteristics reflecting those of inherited cardiac channelopathies and most likely amount to impaired repolarization reserve. The dynamic electrocardiogram and neurological features point to periodic systemic decompensation in ATP1A3-expressing organs. Cardiac dysfunction may account for some of the unexplained premature mortality of alternating hemiplegia. Systematic cardiac investigation is warranted in alternating hemiplegia of childhood, as cardiac arrhythmic morbidity and mortality are potentially preventable.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 American Academy of Neurology.Objective: To investigate associations of frequency, quantity, binge, and problem drinking with cognitive function in older Eastern European adults. Methods: The investigation included 14,575 participants, aged 47 to 78 years at cognitive assessment in 2006-2008 from Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland), and 6 Czech towns participating in the HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol, and Psychosocial Factors in Eastern Europe) prospective cohort study. Average response rates were 59% at baseline (2002-2005) and 63% in 2006-2008. Alcohol consumption was assessed at baseline and in 2006-2008. Cognitive tests included immediate and delayed word recall, semantic fluency (animal naming), and letter cancellation. Associations between alcohol indices and cognitive scores were analyzed crosssectionally (all measures from 2006 to 2008) and prospectively (alcohol and covariates from 2002 to 2005 and cognition from 2006 to 2008). Results: In cross-sectional analyses, nondrinkers had lower cognitive scores and female moderate drinkers had better cognitive performance than light drinkers. Heavy, binge, and problem drinking were not consistently associated with cognitive function. Few associations were replicated in prospective analyses. Participants who stopped drinking during follow-up had worse cognition than stable drinkers; in men, regression coefficients (95% confidence interval) ranged from 20.26 (20.36, 20.16) for immediate recall to 20.14 (20.24, 20.04) for fluency. Conclusion: Regular and episodic heavy drinking were not consistently associated with cognitive function. Worse cognition in participants who stopped drinking during follow-up suggests that inclusion of less healthy ex-drinkers may partly explain poorer cognition in nondrinkers.",

Building on this, within digital humanities there have been attempts to crowdsource more complex tasks traditionally assumed to be carried out by academic scholars, such as the accurate transcription of manuscript material. This chapter surveys the growth and uptake of crowdsourcing within digital humanities, raising issues which emerge when building projects for and with a wide online audience.",

The medical consequences after a sport-related concussion have received increased attention in recent years since it is known that concussions cause axonal and glial damage, which disturbs the cerebral physiology and makes the brain more vulnerable for additional concussions. This study reports on a knocked-out amateur boxer in whom cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NFL) protein, reflecting axonal damage, was used to identify and monitor brain damage. CSF NFL was markedly increased during 36 weeks, suggesting that neuronal injury persists longer than expected after a concussion. CSF biomarker analysis may be valuable in the medical counselling of concussed athletes and in return-to-play considerations. Level of evidence IV",

            "Abstract": "Objectives Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), using brief cycles of limb ischaemia/reperfusion, is a non-invasive, low-cost intervention that may reduce perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We investigated whether RIPC can also improve short-term clinical outcomes. Methods One hundred and eighty patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and/ or valve surgery were randomised to receive either RIPC (2-5 min cycles of simultaneous upper arm and thigh cuff inflation/deflation; N=90) or control (uninflated cuffs placed on the upper arm and thigh; N=90). The study primary end point was PMI, measured by 72 h area under the curve (AUC) serum high-sensitive troponin-T (hsTnT); secondary end point included short-term clinical outcomes. Results RIPC reduced PMI magnitude by 26% (-9.303 difference (CI - 15.618 to - 2.987) 72 h hsTnT-AUC; p=0.003) compared with control. There was also evidence that RIPC reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 54% (11% RIPC vs 24% control; p=0.031) and decreased the incidence of acute kidney injury by 48% (10.0% RIPC vs 21.0% control; p=0.063), and intensive care unit stay by 1 day (2.0 days RIPC (CI 1.0 to 4.0) vs 3.0 days control (CI 2.0 to 4.5); p=0.043). In a post hoc analysis, we found that control patients administered intravenous glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) intraoperatively sustained 39% less PMI compared with those not receiving GTN, and RIPC did not appear to reduce PMI in patients given GTN. Conclusions RIPC reduced the extent of PMI in patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery. RIPC may also have beneficial effects on short-term clinical outcomes, although this will need to be confirmed in future studies. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00397163.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Marjan Colletti 2013. All rights reserved.Digital Poetics celebrates the architectural design exuberance made possible by new digital modelling techniques and fabrication technologies. By presenting an unconventional and original 'humanistic' theory of CAD (computer-aided design), the author suggests that beyond the generation of innovative engineering forms, digital design has the potential to affect the wider complex cultural landscape of today in profound ways. The book is organised around a synthetic and hybrid research methodology: a contemporary, propositional and theoretical discursive investigation and a design-led empirical research. Both methods inform a critical construct that deals with the nature, forms, and laws of digitality within a contemporary architectural discourse that affects practice and academia. The chapters spiral at, from, towards, around, outside-inwards and back inside-out digitality, its cognitive phenomena, spatial properties and intrinsic capabilities to achieve, or at least, approach Digital Poetics. The book presents speculative and small-scale constructed projects that pioneer techniques and experiments with common 3D and 4D software packages, whereby the focus lies not on the drawing processes and mechanics, but on the agency and impact the image (its reading, experience, interpretation) achieves on the reader and observer. The book also features a preface by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Migayrou, a philosopher and curator, and one of the most influential cultural engineers of the contemporary international architectural scene.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis with renal involvement requires treatment with potentially toxic drugs to reduce morbidity and mortality, and there is a major challenge to determine clinical and histological features predictive of renal prognosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of the 2010 international histological classification for ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAGN) as a predictor of renal outcome when used in conjunction with other prognostic factors. Methods . One hundred and four patients with AAGN treated at our centre were included: 23 were classified as focal, 26 as crescentic, 48 as mixed and 7 as sclerotic. Renal outcomes were based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 and 5 years, and on renal survival. Results . By univariate analysis, patients in the focal class had the best renal outcome, those in the sclerotic class the worst outcome, and those in the mixed and crescentic classes had intermediate renal survival. Therewas no significant difference in outcome between the mixed and crescentic classes. In multivariate models, histological class did not improve model fit or associate with renal outcome after adjusting for established prognostic factors. Lower percentage of normal glomeruli, greater degree of tubular atrophy (TA), MPOANCApositivity, increasing age and lower starting eGFR, all correlated with poorer renal outcomes. Conclusions . We conclude that, in our cohort of patients, the international histological classification is predictive of renal outcome in AAGN, but did not appear to be additionally informative over other established prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. However, it may be of value to combine the current histological classification with other established parameters, such as TA and percentage normal glomeruli.",

Among its successes is the burgeoning field of applied positive psychology (APP), involving interventions to promote wellbeing. However, the remit of APP is currently unclear. As such, we offer a meta-theoretical conceptual map delineating the terrain that APP might conceivably cover, namely, the Layered Integrated Framework Example model. The model is based on Wilber\u2019s (J Conscious Stud 4(1):71\u201392, 1997) Integral Framework, which features the four main ontological \u2018dimensions\u2019 of the person. We then stratify these dimensions to produce a comprehensive conceptual map of the person, and of the potential areas of application for APP. For example, we deconstruct the collective dimensions of Wilber\u2019s framework using the levels of Bronfenbrenner\u2019s (Am Psychol 32(7):513\u2013531, 1977) experimental ecology. The result is a detailed multidimensional framework which facilitates a comprehensive approach to promoting wellbeing, and which charts a way forward for APP.",

However, patterns of mixing in the general population are poorly understood. We analysed data from a national probability sample survey of households, the Health Survey for England 2010. A total of 943 heterosexual couples living together, where at least one partner was aged between 16-44 years, were included. We used correlation coefficients to measure the strength of similarities between partners with respect to demographic characteristics, general health, health behaviours and sexual history. Males were on average 2 years older than their female partners, although this age difference ranged from a median of 0 years in men aged 16-24 years to a median of 2 years in men aged 35-44 years. A positive correlation between partners was found for all demographic characteristics. With respect to general health and health behaviours, a strongly positive correlation was found between men and women in reporting alcohol consumption at \u22653 days a week and smoking. Men typically reported greater numbers of sexual partners than their female partner, although men and women with more partners were more likely to mix with each other. We have been able to elucidate the patterns of sexual mixing between men and women living together in England. Mixing based on demographic characteristics was more assortative than sexual characteristics. These data can better inform mathematical models of STI transmission.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution with lung function in adult participants from five cohorts in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE). Residential exposure to nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOx) and particulate matter (PM) was modelled and traffic indicators were assessed in a standardised manner. The spirometric parameters forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) from 7613 subjects were considered as outcomes. Cohort-specific results were combined using meta-analysis. We did not observe an association of air pollution with longitudinal change in lung function, but we observed that a 10\u03bcg\u00b7m-3 increase in NO2 exposure was associated with lower levels of FEV1 (-14.0 mL, 95% CI -25.8 to -2.1) and FVC (-14.9 mL, 95% CI -28.7 to -1.1). An increase of 10 \u03bcg\u00b7m-3 in PM10, but not other PM metrics (PM2.5, coarse fraction of PM, PM absorbance), was associated with a lower level of FEV1 (-44.6 mL, 95% CI -85.4 to -3.8) and FVC (-59.0 mL, 95% CI-112.3 to -5.6). The associations were particularly strong in obese persons. This study adds to the evidence for an adverse association of ambient air pollution with lung function in adults at very low levels in Europe.",

In particular, we treat oscillations as the (observable) signature of context-sensitive changes in synaptic efficacy that underlie coordinated dynamics and message-passing in the brain. This rich source of information is now being exploited by various procedures-like dynamic causal modelling-to test hypotheses about neuronal circuits in health and disease. Furthermore, the roles played by neuromodulatory mechanisms can be addressed directly through their effects on oscillatory phenomena. These neuromodulatory or gain control processes are central to many theories of normal brain function (e.g. attention) and the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease). \u00a9 2014.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).Background: Suicide is a major global health problem, especially among youth. Suicide is known to be associated with a variety of social, economic, political and religious factors, vary across geographical and cultural regions. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of socioeconomic factors on suicide mortality rate across different regions in Iran. Methods: The data on distribution of population and socio-economic factors (such as unemployment rate, divorce rate, urbanization rate, average household expenditure etc.) at province level were obtained from the Statistical Centre of Iran and the National Organization for Civil Registration. The data on the annual number of deaths caused by suicide in each province was extracted from the published reports of the Iranian Forensic Medicine Organization. We used a decomposition model to distinguish between spatial and temporal variation in suicide mortality. Results: The average rate of suicide mortality was 5.5 per 100,000 population over the study period. Across the provinces (spatial variation), suicide mortality rate was positively associated with household expenditure and the proportion of people aged 15-24 and older than 65 years and was negatively associated with the proportion of literate people. Within the provinces (temporal variation), higher divorce rate was associated with higher suicide mortality. By excluding the outlier provinces, the results showed that in addition to the proportion of people aged 15-24 and older than 65, divorce and unemployment rates were also significant predictors of spatial variation in suicide mortality while divorce rate was associated with higher suicide mortality within provinces. Conclusion: The findings indicate that both spatial and temporal variations in suicide mortality rates across the provinces and over time are determined by a number of socio-economic factors. The study provides information that can be of importance in developing preventive strategies.",

In this work, we give rigorous analytic results on thermalization for translation-invariant quantum lattice systems with finite-range interaction of arbitrary strength, in all cases where there is a unique equilibrium state at the corresponding temperature. We clarify the physical picture by showing that subsystems relax towards the reduction of the global Gibbs state, not the local Gibbs state, if the initial state has close to maximal population entropy and certain non-degeneracy conditions on the spectrumare satisfied.Moreover,we showthat almost all pure states with support on a small energy window are locally thermal in the sense of canonical typicality. We derive our results from a statement on equivalence of ensembles, generalizing earlier results by Lima, and give numerical and analytic finite size bounds, relating the Ising model to the finite de Finetti theorem. Furthermore, we prove that global energy eigenstates are locally close to diagonal in the local energy eigenbasis, which constitutes a part of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis that is valid regardless of the integrability of the model.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.Good nutrition in the early years of life is essential, yet the diets of many pre-school children in the UK are known to be poor. Understanding the decisions parents make when feeding young children is very important in determining what type and nature of interventional support may be developed to promote good nutrition. The aim of this study was to explore using qualitative methods, parental perceptions of feeding their children in order to inform the development of a nutrition intervention. Focus groups (n=33) and individual interviews (n=6) were undertaken with parents, most of whom were attending children's centres in two deprived populations from one urban (Islington, north London) and one rural (Cornwall) location in England. Accounts of feeding pre-school children were primarily concerned with dealing with the practicalities of modern life, in particular the cost of food and the need to manage on a restricted household budget. Time pressures, a lack of perceived knowledge and confidence in preparing food and managing conflict over food choices between family members were also strong themes. Parents commonly reported differences between how they would like to feed their children and the reality of what they were able to do in their circumstances. These findings suggest that the poor eating habits of many pre-school children may be less a case of parental ignorance but rather the product of a range of coping strategies. Designing an intervention, which helps parents to build their confidence and self-efficacy, may enable them to make positive changes to their children's diets.",

Demographics, disease activity (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K]), disease damage (SLICC/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index [SDI]), and laboratory data from the baseline or first followup visit were assessed. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to asses for any cross-sectional associations between anti-Ro/SSA and EKG repolarization abnormalities.Results: For the 779 patients included, mean \u00b1 SD age was 35.2 \u00b1 13.8 years, 88.4% were women, and mean \u00b1 SD disease duration was 10.5 \u00b1 14.5 months. Mean \u00b1 SD SLEDAI-2K score was 5.4 \u00b1 5.6 and mean \u00b1 SD SDI score was 0.5 \u00b1 1.0. EKG abnormalities were frequent and included nonspecific ST-T changes (30.9%), possible left ventricular hypertrophy (5.4%), and supraventricular arrhythmias (1.3%). A QTc >440 msec was found in 15.3%, while a QTc >460 msec was found in 5.3%. Mean \u00b1 SD QTd was 34.2 \u00b1 14.7 msec and QTd >40 msec was frequent (38.1%). Neither the specificity nor the level of anti-Ro/SSA was associated with QTc duration or QTd, although confidence intervals were wide. Total SDI was significantly associated with a QTc interval exceeding 440 msec (odds ratio 1.38 [95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.79]).Conclusion: A substantial proportion of patients with recent-onset SLE exhibited repolarization abnormalities, although severe abnormalities were rare.",

The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, and the relationship between mean transverse momentum and chargedparticle multiplicity are measured for events with at least one charged particle in the kinematic range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and pT > 500 MeV. The measurements are compared to Monte Carlo models of proton-proton collisions and to results from other experiments at the same centre-of-mass energy. The charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity at \u03b7 = 0 is measured to be 1.333 \u00b1 0.003(stat.) \u00b1 0.040(syst.), which is 5-15% higher than the Monte Carlo models predict.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Legal and Criminological Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Purpose: Behavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders. Methods: Using a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences. Results: Findings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered \u2013 some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.",

All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate the coexistence of anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic axonal degeneration, and to explore the relationship between selective visual pathway damage and global brain involvement in longstanding multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: In this single-centre, cross-sectional study, patients with longstanding MS (N=222) and healthy controls (HC, N=62) were included. We analysed thickness of retinal layers (optical coherence tomography), damage within optic radiations (OR) (lesion volume and fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity by diffusion tensor imaging) and atrophy of the visual cortex and that of grey and white matter of the whole-brain (structural MRI). Linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between the different components and for comparing patients with and without optic neuritis and HC. Results: In patients with MS, an episode of optic neuritis (MSON) was significantly associated with decreased integrity of the ORs and thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC). Lesion volume in the OR was negatively associated with pRNFL and GCC thickness in patients without optic neuritis (MSNON). The pRNFL and GCC showed associations with integrity of the OR, thickness of the primary visual cortex (only in patients with MSON), and also with global white and grey matter atrophy. In HCs, no such relationships were demonstrated. Interpretation: This study provides evidence for presence of bidirectional (both anterograde and retrograde) trans-synaptic axonal degeneration in the visual pathway of patients with MS. Additionally, thinning of the retinal pRNFL and GCC are related to global white and grey matter atrophy in addition to pathology of the visual pathway.",

Given the economic incentives, the fracture model is employed to test the suitability of the existing stock of natural gas pipelines with the relatively high ductile to brittle transition temperatures of 0 and -10\u00b0C for transporting CO2 in the terms of their resistance to brittle fracture propagation. The hypothetical but nevertheless realistic scenarios simulated involve both buried and above ground 10km long, 0.6m i.d. pipelines. Based on the assumption of no blowout of the surrounding soil upon the formation of the initial leak, the results show that the transition of the leak into a running brittle fracture in buried CO2 pipelines is far more likely as compared to above ground pipelines. In addition, gas phase pipelines are more prone to undergoing a propagating brittle fracture as compared to dense phase pipelines despite the lower operating pressures of the former. Furthermore, counter-intuitively, isolation of the feed flow following the discovery of a leak is shown to facilitate brittle fracture failure. The initial defect geometry on the other hand is shown to have a profound impact on the pipeline's resistance to propagating brittle fractures.",

We propose an extension of the hyper Markov properties of Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272-1317], which we term structural Markov properties, for both undirected decomposable and directed acyclic graphs, which requires that the structure of distinct components of the graph be conditionally independent given the existence of a separating component. This allows the analysis and comparison of multiple graphical structures, while being able to take advantage of the common conditional independence constraints. Moreover, we show that these properties characterise exponential families, which form conjugate priors under sampling from compatible Markov distributions.",

Methods: We studied 129 consecutive patients (23.7 \u00b1 20.9 years, range 0\u201374 years; male/female 68%/32%). Pre-specified RF were categorized into five domains: family history; signs/symptoms; electrocardiography; imaging; and laboratory. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and predictive accuracy of RF were analyzed in the genotyped population. Results: In the overall cohort of 129 patients, 169 RF were identified in 62 patients (48%). Prevalence of RF was higher in infants (78%) and in adults >55 years old (58%). Following targeted genetic and clinical evaluation, 94 patients (74%) had a definite diagnosis (sarcomeric HCM or specific causes of HCM). We observed 14 RF in 13 patients (21%) with sarcomeric gene disease, 129 RF in 34 patients (97%) with other specific causes of HCM, and 26 RF in 15 patients (45%) with idiopathic HCM (p < 0.0001). Non-sarcomeric causes of HCM were the most prevalent in ages <1yo and > 55yo. Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and PA of RF were 97%, 70%, 55%, 98% and 77%, respectively. Single and clinical combination of RF (clusters) had an high specificity, NPV and predictive accuracy for the specific etiologies (syndromes/metabolic/infiltrative disorders associated with HCM). Conclusions: An extensive diagnostic work up, focused on analysis of specific diagnostic RF in patients with unexplained LVH facilitates a clinical diagnosis in 74% of patients with HCM.",

We studied the functional hematopoietic potential of transduced green fluorescent protein (GFP+) sheep amniotic fluid (AF) stem cells, before and after autologous IUSCT. CD34+ cells were selected from first trimester sheep AF, transduced overnight, and injected intravenously into NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice. At 3 months, primary recipient bone marrow (BM) was injected into secondary NSG recipients. GFP+ cells were detected in the hematopoietic organs and peripheral blood of primary and secondary recipients at 3 months. Autologous IUSCT (transduced GFP+CD34+AF) was performed in fetal sheep. Six months postnatally, lamb BM was injected into secondary NSG recipients. GFP+ cells were detected in the peripheral blood of primary and secondary recipients. This confirms the hematopoietic potential of AF stem cells supporting the concept of autologous IUSCT to treat congenital hematopoietic disease. Stem Cells 2015;33:122-132",

            "Abstract": "Introduction: The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) has issued guidance regarding the use of reoperation rates in the revalidation of UK-based orthopaedic surgeons. Currently, little has been published concerning acceptable rates of reoperation following primary surgical management of orthopaedic trauma, particularly with reference to revalidation. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing clearly defined reoperations following primary surgical management of trauma between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011. A full case note review was undertaken to establish the demographics, clinical course and context of reoperation. A review of the imaging was performed to establish whether the procedure performed was in line with accepted trauma practice and whether the technical execution was acceptable. Results: A total of 3,688 patients underwent primary procedures within the time period studied while 70 (1.90%, 99% CI: 1.39-2.55) required an unplanned reoperation. Thirty-nine (56%) of these patients were male. The mean age of patients was 56 years (range: 18-98 years) and there was a median time to reoperation of 50 days (IQR: 13-154 days). Potentially avoidable reoperations occurred in 41 patients (58.6%, 99% CI: 43.2-72.6). This was largely due to technical errors (40 patients, 57.1%, 99% CI: 41.8-71.3), representing 1.11% (99% CI: 0.73-1.64) of the total trauma workload. Within RCS guidelines, 28-day reoperation rates for hip, wrist and ankle fractures were 1.4% (99% CI: 0.5-3.3), 3.5% (99% CI: 0.8%-12.1) and 1.86% (99% CI: 0.4-6.6) respectively. Conclusions: We present novel work that has established baseline reoperation rates for index procedures required for revalidation of orthopaedic surgeons.",

All rights reserved.In recent years we have witnessed drastic transformations in the European geo-political and socio-economic map. Such changes not only pertained to the functional relations between regions, but at times also concerned the morphology of the network system in Europe. These structural developments have prompted various research questions on the relationships between spatial structure and spatial processes in a network economy. A rather common concept - often accepted in European policy decisions - is the notion of spatial hierarchy in networks, which implies a multi-layered configuration with major nodes at the top of the hierarchy. In this context, it is an intriguing research question to ask what these hierarchical concepts precisely mean and how they can be investigated in an operational sense. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on this issue. The starting point of our analysis will be the theory of hierarchical systems.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Penelope Haralambidou 2013.While much has been written on Marcel Duchamp - one of the twentieth century's most beguiling artists - the subject of his flirtation with architecture seems to have been largely overlooked. Yet, in the carefully arranged plans and sections organising the blueprint of desire in the Large Glass, his numerous pieces replicating architectural fragments, and his involvement in designing exhibitions, Duchamp's fascination with architectural design is clearly evident. As his unconventional architectural influences - Niceron, Lequeu and Kiesler - and diverse legacy - Tschumi, OMA, Webb, Diller + Scofidio and Nicholson - indicate, Duchamp was not as much interested in 'built' architecture as he was in the architecture of desire, re-constructing the imagination through drawing and testing the boundaries between reality and its aesthetic and philosophical possibilities. Marcel Duchamp and the Architecture of Desire examines the link between architectural thinking and Duchamp's work. By employing design, drawing and making - the tools of the architect - Haralambidou performs an architectural analysis of Duchamp\u2019s final enigmatic work Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas\u2026 demonstrating an innovative research methodology able to grasp meaning beyond textual analysis. This novel reading of his ideas and methods adds to, but also challenges, other art-historical interpretations. Through three main themes - allegory, visuality and desire - the book defines and theorises an alternative drawing practice positioned between art and architecture that predates and includes Duchamp.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: Early discharge hospital at home is a service that provides active treatment by healthcare professionals in the patient's home for a condition that otherwise would require acute hospital inpatient care. This is an update of a Cochrane review. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with early discharge hospital at home compared with inpatient hospital care. Search methods: We searched the following databases to 9 January 2017: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and EconLit. We searched clinical trials registries. Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing early discharge hospital at home with acute hospital inpatient care for adults. We excluded obstetric, paediatric and mental health hospital at home schemes. Data collection and analysis: We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and EPOC. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for the most important outcomes. Main results: We included 32 trials (N = 4746), six of them new for this update, mainly conducted in high-income countries. We judged most of the studies to have a low or unclear risk of bias. The intervention was delivered by hospital outreach services (17 trials), community-based services (11 trials), and was co-ordinated by a hospital-based stroke team or physician in conjunction with community-based services in four trials. Studies recruiting people recovering from stroke Early discharge hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to mortality at three to six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.48, N = 1114, 11 trials, moderate-certainty evidence) and may make little or no difference to the risk of hospital readmission (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.66, N = 345, 5 trials, low-certainty evidence). Hospital at home may lower the risk of living in institutional setting at six months (RR 0.63, 96% CI 0.40 to 0.98; N = 574, 4 trials, low-certainty evidence) and might slightly improve patient satisfaction (N = 795, low-certainty evidence). Hospital at home probably reduces hospital length of stay, as moderate-certainty evidence found that people assigned to hospital at home are discharged from the intervention about seven days earlier than people receiving inpatient care (95% CI 10.19 to 3.17 days earlier, N = 528, 4 trials). It is uncertain whether hospital at home has an effect on cost (very low-certainty evidence). Studies recruiting people with a mix of medical conditions Early discharge hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49; N = 1247, 8 trials, moderate-certainty evidence). In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) there was insufficient information to determine the effect of these two approaches on mortality (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.12, N = 496, 5 trials, low-certainty evidence). The intervention probably increases the risk of hospital readmission in a mix of medical conditions, although the results are also compatible with no difference and a relatively large increase in the risk of readmission (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.58, N = 1276, 9 trials, moderate-certainty evidence). Early discharge hospital at home may decrease the risk of readmission for people with COPD (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13, N = 496, 5 trials low-certainty evidence). Hospital at home may lower the risk of living in an institutional setting (RR 0.69, 0.48 to 0.99; N = 484, 3 trials, low-certainty evidence). The intervention might slightly improve patient satisfaction (N = 900, low-certainty evidence). The effect of early discharge hospital at home on hospital length of stay for older patients with a mix of conditions ranged from a reduction of 20 days to a reduction of less than half a day (moderate-certainty evidence, N = 767). It is uncertain whether hospital at home has an effect on cost (very low-certainty evidence). Studies recruiting people undergoing elective surgery Three studies did not report higher rates of mortality with hospital at home compared with inpatient care (data not pooled, N = 856, low-certainty evidence; mainly orthopaedic surgery). Hospital at home may lead to little or no difference in readmission to hospital for people who were mainly recovering from orthopaedic surgery (N = 1229, low-certainty evidence). We could not establish the effects of hospital at home on the risk of living in institutional care, due to a lack of data. The intervention might slightly improve patient satisfaction (N = 1229, low-certainty evidence). People recovering from orthopaedic surgery allocated to early discharge hospital at home were discharged from the intervention on average four days earlier than people allocated to usual inpatient care (4.44 days earlier, 95% CI 6.37 to 2.51 days earlier, N = 411, 4 trials, moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether hospital at home has an effect on cost (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Despite increasing interest in the potential of early discharge hospital at home services as a less expensive alternative to inpatient care, this review provides insufficient evidence of economic benefit (through a reduction in hospital length of stay) or improved health outcomes.",

            "Abstract": "Degradation of the myelin sheath is a common pathology underlying demyelinating neurological diseases from Multiple Sclerosis to Leukodistrophies. Although large malformations of myelin ultrastructure in the advanced stages of Wallerian degradation is known, its subtle structural variations at early stages of demyelination remains poorly characterized. This is partly due to the lack of suitable and non-invasive experimental probes possessing sufficient resolution to detect the degradation. Here we report the feasibility of the application of an innovative non-invasive local structure experimental approach for imaging the changes of statistical structural fluctuations in the first stage of myelin degeneration. Scanning micro X-ray diffraction, using advances in synchrotron X-ray beam focusing, fast data collection, paired with spatial statistical analysis, has been used to unveil temporal changes in the myelin structure of dissected nerves following extraction of the Xenopus laevis sciatic nerve. The early myelin degeneration is a specific ordered compacted phase preceding the swollen myelin phase of Wallerian degradation. Our demonstration of the feasibility of the statistical analysis of S\u03bcXRD measurements using biological tissue paves the way for further structural investigations of degradation and death of neurons and other cells and tissues in diverse pathological states where nanoscale structural changes may be uncovered.",

William Twining believes that many jurists have been fascinating people struggling with questions that are both historically significant and relevant to contemporary issues. This book brings together previously published essays that centre on three related themes: reading Juristic texts, the role of narrative in law, and relations between theory and practice. Building on a pragmatic view of jurisprudence, the author explores different ways of reading and using Juristic texts, to set them in context, to bring them to life and to engage with the reader's own concerns. He applies this approach to throw fresh light on four familiar figures - Holmes, Bentham, Hart and Llewellyn. Challenging limited agendas and parochial points of view, Twining outlines a programme for a broad approach to legal theory in the context of globalization. He satirizes some bad habits in jurisprudence and explores in depth how stories can be seductive vehicles for cheating in legal contexts, yet are essential for making sense of disputes about fact or law.",

            "Abstract": "Background: In multiple sclerosis (MS), pathological studies have identified substantial demyelination and neuronal loss in the spinal cord grey matter (GM). However, there has been limited in vivo investigation of cord GM abnormalities and their possible functional effects using MRI combined with clinical evaluation. Methods: We recruited healthy controls (HC) and people with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) MS. All subjects had 3 T spinal cord MRI with measurement of cord cross-sectional area and diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the GM and posterior and lateral column white matter tracts using region of interest analysis. Physical disability was assessed using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and motor components of the MS functional composite scale. We calculated differences between MS and HC using a ANOVA and associations with disability using linear regression. Results: 113 people were included in this study: 30 controls, 21 CIS, 33 RR and 29 SPMS. Spinal cord radial diffusivity (RD), fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in the GM and posterior columns were significantly more abnormal in SPMS than in RRMS. Spinal cord GM RD (\u03b2=0.33, p<0.01) and cord area (\u03b2=.0.45, p<0.01) were independently associated with EDSS (R2=0.77); spinal cord GM RD was also independently associated with a 9-hole peg test (\u03b2=.0.33, p<0.01) and timed walk (\u03b2=.0.20, p=0.04). Conclusions: The study findings suggest that pathological involvement of the spinal cord GM contributes significantly to physical disability in relapseonset MS and SPMS in particular.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 StataCorp LP.We present the clrbound, clr2bound, clr3bound, and clrtest commands for estimation and inference on intersection bounds as developed by Chernozhukov, Lee, and Rosen (2013, Econometrica 81: 667\u2013737). The intersection bounds framework encompasses situations where a population parameter of interest is partially identified by a collection of consistently estimable upper and lower bounds. The identified set for the parameter is the intersection of regions defined by this collection of bounds. More generally, the methodology can be applied to settings where an estimable function of a vector-valued parameter is bounded from above and below, as is the case when the identified set is characterized by conditional moment inequalities. The commands clrbound, clr2bound, and clr3bound provide bound estimates that can be used directly for estimation or to construct asymptotically valid confidence sets. clrtest performs an intersection bound test of the hypothesis that a collection of lower intersection bounds is no greater than zero. The command clrbound provides bound estimates for one-sided lower or upper intersection bounds on a parameter, while clr2bound and clr3bound provide two-sided bound estimates using both lower and upper intersection bounds. clr2bound uses Bonferroni\u2019s inequality to construct two-sided bounds that can be used to perform asymptotically valid inference on the identified set or the parameter of interest, whereas clr3bound provides a generally tighter confidence interval for the parameter by inverting the hypothesis test performed by clrtest. More broadly, inversion of this test can also be used to construct confidence sets based on conditional moment inequalities as described in Chernozhukov, Lee, and Rosen (2013). The commands include parametric, series, and local linear estimation procedures.",

Histologically, NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fbrosis, and cirrhosis. As NASH develops in only 10-15% of patients with NAFLD, it is not practical to biopsy all patients who present with NAFLD. Noninvasive fbrosis tests have been extensively developed recently and ofer alternatives for staging fbrosis. Despite their increasing use, such tests cannot adequately differentiate simple steatosis from NASH. At present, such tests can be used as first line tests to rule out patients without advanced fbrosis and thus prevent unnecessary secondary care refferrals in a significant number of patients. In this review we present the evidence for the use of noninvasive fbrosis tests in patients with NAFLD.",

Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY.Background: Working long hours might have adverse health effects, but whether this is true for all socioeconomic status groups is unclear. In this meta-analysis stratified by socioeconomic status, we investigated the role of long working hours as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Methods: We identified four published studies through a systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase up to April 30, 2014. Study inclusion criteria were English-language publication; prospective design (cohort study); investigation of the effect of working hours or overtime work; incident diabetes as an outcome; and relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs, or sufficient information to calculate these estimates. Additionally, we used unpublished individual-level data from 19 cohort studies from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working-Populations Consortium and international open-access data archives. Effect estimates from published and unpublished data from 222120 men and women from the USA, Europe, Japan, and Australia were pooled with random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: During 1.7 million person-years at risk, 4963 individuals developed diabetes (incidence 29 per 10000 person-years). The minimally adjusted summary risk ratio for long (\u226555 h per week) compared with standard working hours (35-40 h) was 1.07 (95% CI 0.89-1.27, difference in incidence three cases per 10000 person-years) with significant heterogeneity in study-specific estimates (I<sup>2</sup>=53%, p=0.0016). In an analysis stratified by socioeconomic status, the association between long working hours and diabetes was evident in the low socioeconomic status group (risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.57, difference in incidence 13 per 10000 person-years, I<sup>2</sup>=0%, p=0.4662), but was null in the high socioeconomic status group (1.00, 95% CI 0.80-1.25, incidence difference zero per 10000 person-years, I<sup>2</sup>=15%, p=0.2464). The association in the low socioeconomic status group was robust to adjustment for age, sex, obesity, and physical activity, and remained after exclusion of shift workers. Interpretation: In this meta-analysis, the link between longer working hours and type 2 diabetes was apparent only in individuals in the low socioeconomic status groups.

In the venusian atmosphere, cosmic rays are expected to be the dominant ionization source below ~100. km altitude. While previous studies have considered the effect of cosmic ray ionization using approximate transport methods, we have for the first time performed full 3D Monte Carlo modeling of cosmic ray interaction with the venusian atmosphere, including the contribution of high-. Z cosmic ray ions (. Z=. 1-28). Our predictions are similar to those of previous studies at the ionization peak near 63. km altitude, but are significantly different to these both above and below this altitude. The rate of atmospheric ionization is a fundamental atmospheric property and the results of this study have wide-reaching applications in topics including atmospheric electrical processes, cloud microphysics and atmospheric chemistry.",

This research aims to develop a new method to improve the rigor of MCS by establishing the link between parameter estimation and assessment of individual risk sources. The method is validated by virtue of its predictive power for the likelihood of a project being successful in securing investors. Eight Taiwanese sewerage build-operate-transfer projects are investigated. Compared with the discounted cash flow approach, this new method can provide a more accurate prediction using the expert's assessment as input of financial impact and occurrence likelihood of individual risks. This finding furnishes solid empirical evidence for the value MCS might add to project appraisal.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.The following research applies a socio-technical approach to an original study of the role of BRE environmental assessment method (BREEAM) in sustainable building practice. The primary objective is to gain insight into what facilitates and what weakens professional associations to implement a sustainability agenda in a building project. It focuses on understanding different sets of meaning which underlie engagement with BREEAM and how BREEAM is actioned. To do this, the research framework draws on social network analysis. However, this research does not consider that sustainable building is merely an outcome of planned action. Instead, sustainable building is seen to involve processes of engagement amongst different groups, technologies, materials and methods. Therefore, the conceptual framework adopted incorporates consideration of the materiality of sustainable building engagements, highlighting the relations between actors. Interviews with project professionals involved in a case study of a BREEAM Outstanding development provide the empirical basis for this work. This research will be of interest to scholars interested in socio-technical approaches to building development, environmental building assessment methods and sustainable building.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.CONTEXT: Despite the extent of volunteers' contribution to palliative care, and their role in direct patient care, there has been no systematic evaluation of the evidence-base on volunteers in relation to patient and family wellbeing.OBJECTIVE: To critically review research, on the impact of volunteers involved in the direct care of palliative patients and their families.METHODS: We searched for studies, reporting patient and family data on the impact of volunteer services in palliative care in thirteen citation databases up to May 2013. We included quantitative comparative studies. We also noted any non-comparative studies, enabling us to give a comprehensive review of the existing research. We also included qualitative studies that explored the experiences of patients and families who received volunteer support, potentially illustrating which aspects of volunteer activities patients and families value. We applied quality appraisal criteria to all studies meeting inclusion criteria. Two researchers undertook key review processes.RESULTS: We found eight studies. Only two studies were undertaken outside of North America; one in the Netherlands and the other in Uganda. All studies were in adult palliative care services. All evaluated volunteers were in home care settings, three of the studies included other settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. All of the studies fulfilled our quality appraisal criteria. Six of them were quantitative studies and two were comparative: one found that those families who experienced greater (as opposed to lesser) volunteer involvement were significantly more satisfied with care; the other found that patients survived significantly longer if they had received home visits from a volunteer. Four cross-sectional studies focused on satisfaction ratings. No study considered possible disadvantages or adverse effects of volunteer involvement. Two qualitative studies were identified; both highlighted the uniqueness of the role volunteers may fulfil in care support, from the viewpoint of patients and their families.CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to ensure the resource of volunteers in palliative care is used appropriately and effectively. Evaluation in well-designed comparative studies is recommended including economic analyses, as are further qualitative studies to explore the roles, benefits and possible adverse effects of volunteers. Evaluation is particularly needed outside of North America and in dedicated hospice facilities.",

The interactive fixed effects can be arbitrarily correlated with the observed product characteristics (including price), which accommodate endogeneity and, at the same time, capture strong persistence in market shares across products and markets. We propose a two-step least squares-minimum distance (LS-MD) procedure to calculate the estimator. Our estimator is easy to compute, and Monte Carlo simulations show that it performs well.

All rights reserved.From around 1800, particularly in Germany, Greek tragedy has been privileged in popular and scholarly discourse for its relation to apparently timeless metaphysical, existential, ethical, aesthetic, and psychological questions. The tradition of philosophical appropriations of Greek tragedy encompasses many of the most important thinkers of the past two centuries, including Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger. These theories have arguably had a more profound influence on modern understanding of the genre than works of classical scholarship or theatrical performances. Tragedy and the Idea of Modernity aims to mediate between the concerns of classicists and those of intellectual historians and philosophers, and thereby to open paths for approaching and appropriating this tradition. The book is focused on the way that understandings of Greek tragedy have conditioned notions of modernity, and suggests that the meaning of tragedy today is substantially formed by this interplay. Chapters span 2500 years of literature and philosophy, mediating between ancient and modern concepts of tragedy, and between readings of individual plays and considerations of genre.",

The present study investigates the role of MD as a specific social-cognitive construct that, in the organizational context, may intervene in the process leading from stressors to counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Assuming the theoretical framework of the stressor-emotion model of CWB, we hypothesized that MD mediates, at least partially, the relation between negative emotions in reaction to perceived stressors and CWB by promoting or justifying aggressive responses to frustrating situations or events. In a sample of 1,147 Italian workers, we tested a structural equations model. The results support our hypothesis: the more workers experienced negative emotions in response to stressors, the more they morally disengaged and, in turn, enacted CWB.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Understanding phenotype-genotype correlations in retinal degeneration is a major challenge. Mutations in CRB1 lead to a spectrum of autosomal recessive retinal dystrophies with variable phenotypes suggesting the influence of modifying factors. To establish the contribution of the genetic background to phenotypic variability associated with the Crb1rd8/rd8 mutation, we compared the retinal pathology of Crb1rd8/rd8/J inbred mice with that of two Crb1rd8/rd8 lines backcrossed with C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice. Topical endoscopic fundal imaging and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy fundus images of all three Crb1rd8/rd8 lines showed a significant increase in the number of inferior retinal lesions that was strikingly variable between the lines. Optical coherence tomography, semithin, ultrastructural morphology and assessment of inflammatory and vascular marker by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the lesions were associated with photoreceptor death, M\u00fcller and microglia activation and telangiectasia-like vascular remodelling-features that were stable in the inbred, variable in the second, but virtually absent in the third Crb1rd8/rd8 line, even at 12 months of age. This suggests that the Crb1rd8/rd8 mutation is necessary, but not sufficient for the development of these degenerative features. By whole-genome SNP analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation, a candidate region on chromosome 15 was identified. This may carry one or more genetic modifiers for the manifestation of the retinal pathology associated with mutations in Crb1. This study also provides insight into the nature of the retinal vascular lesions that likely represent a clinical correlate for the formation of retinal telangiectasia or Coats-like vasculopathy in patients with CRB1 mutations that are thought to depend on such genetic modifiers.",

Our mirror substrate consists of a carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) core encapsulated in a thick (50\u00b5m) coating of nickel; the coating entirely covers the CFRP front, back and edges. The benefits of CFRP are: that it has high tensile strength, making it exceptionally resistant to breakage and able to withstand high inter-actuator forces; that it can be fabricated in large sections, allowing the production of a 2.6 m monolithic mirror, simplifying system control and eliminating additional diffraction/scattering introduced by segmented mirror systems; its low density (< 1800 kgm\u22123 for a Ni coated substrate). By the end of summer this year (2009) we aim to have constructed a 19 cm diameter fully actuated (37 piezo-stack actuators on a 29 mm triangular grid) prototype and a 1.0 m diameter substrate mounted on a static set of points to demonstrate the scalability of the technology.

Data collection included sociodemographics, lifestyle habits, psychosocial battery and genetic analysis, mental stress responses mimicking daily life stress (blood pressure and haemostatic, cardiometabolic, endothelial and stress hormones). Target organ damage was assessed in the brain, heart, kidney, blood vessels and retina. A unique highly phenotyped cohort is presented that can address the role of a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system and neural response pathways contributing to the burden of cardiometabolic diseases in Africans.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2015.The Planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of the submillimetre polarized emission from Galactic dust. In addition to the information on the direction of the Galactic magnetic field, this also brings new constraints on the properties of dust. The dust grains that emit the radiation seen by Planck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in the visible. Comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellar polarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique new diagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust, and therefore of the important dust model parameters, composition, size, and shape. Using ancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight, we obtain the degree of polarization, p<inf>V</inf>, and the optical depth in the V band to the star, \u03c4<inf>V</inf>. Toward these stars we measure the submillimetre polarized intensity, P<inf>S</inf>, and total intensity, I<inf>S</inf>, in the Planck 353 GHz channel. We compare the column density measure in the visible, E(B - V), with that inferred from the Planck product map of the submillimetre dust optical depth and compare the polarization direction (position angle) in the visible with that in the submillimetre. For those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium with comparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directions close to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visible to find two ratios, R<inf>S/V</inf> = (P<inf>S</inf>/I<inf>S</inf>)/(p<inf>V</inf>/\u03c4<inf>V</inf>) and R<inf>P/p</inf> = P<inf>S</inf>/p<inf>V</inf>, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the aligned grain population alone. We find R<inf>S/V</inf> = 4.2, with statistical and systematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and R<inf>P/p</inf> = 5.4 MJy sr<sup>-1</sup>, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 MJy sr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Our estimate of R<inf>S/V</inf> is compatible with predictions based on a range of polarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellar medium. This estimate provides new empirical validation of many of the common underlying assumptions of the models, but is not yet very discriminating among them. However, our estimate of R<inf>P/p</inf> is not compatible with predictions, which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. This more discriminating diagnostic, R<inf>P/p</inf>, indicates that changes to the optical properties in the models of the aligned grain population are required. These new diagnostics, together with the spectral dependence in the submillimetre from Planck, will be important for constraining and understanding the full complexity of the grain models, and for interpreting the Planck thermal dust polarization and refinement of the separation of this contamination of the cosmic microwave background.",

For those aged 65, remaining life expectancy rose from 15.2 years to 19.1 years over the same time period. Perhaps most importantly, and the focus of this chapter, as the nation grows older it is rapidly becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Currently, there is less racial/ethnic diversity in the population 65 and older than among younger Americans. However, the older population is expected to be 42% minority by 2050 (US Census Bureau, 2011). The dual trends of increased life expectancy and the growing diversity of the aging population raise important theoretical and practical questions about race-based inequalities in health and their consequences for health care spending in light of projected deficits in Medicare.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.The combination of multiple cosmological probes can produce measurements of cosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with any individual probe. We examine the combination of two highly correlated probes of late-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey with photometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortions from a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. We choose generic survey designs so that our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometric and spectroscopic redshift surveys. Combining the surveys greatly improves their power to measure both dark energy and modified gravity. An independent, non-overlapping combination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than four times larger than that produced by either survey alone. The powerful synergies between the surveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints are orthogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly two orders of magnitude larger than either alone. Our projected angular power spectrum formalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when the surveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariance matrix. We calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of these cross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. We find nearly a factor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity. We have also forecast constraints on the linear growth factor, finding a factor of 3.4 improvement for an independent combination of probes and a modest 20 per cent same-sky benefit.",

All rights reserved.Background: Research suggests that policymakers often use personal contacts to find information and advice. However, the main sources of information for public health policymakers are not known. This study aims to describe policymakers' sources of information. A questionnaire survey of public health policymakers across Greater Manchester (GM) was carried out (response rate 48%). All policy actors above Director level involved in public health policy (finding, analyzing or producing information, producing or implementing policy) in GM were included in the sampling frame. Respondents were provided with a list of sources of information and asked which they used (categorical data) and to name specific individuals who acted as sources of information (network data). Data were analyzed using frequencies and network analysis. The most frequently chosen sources of information from the categorical data were NICE, government websites and Directors of Public Health. However, the network data showed that the main sources of information in the network were actually mid-level managers in the NHS, who had no direct expertise in public health. Academics and researchers did not feature in the network. Both survey and network analyses provide useful insights into how policymakers access information. Network analysis offers practical and theoretical contributions to the evidence-based policy debate. Identifying individuals who act as key users and producers of evidence allows academics to target actors likely to use and disseminate their work.",

The presented research shows that homes differ significantly in their respective temperature profile over the course of the day. A cluster analysis performed on temperature data from 275 living rooms in English homes over three winter months resulted in four different clusters of temperature profiles. The clusters differ significantly in their shape, as revealed by visual inspection, and supported by significant differences in minimum and maximum temperatures and temperature variability across the day. About 40% of homes showed a bimodal temperature pattern as assumed under BREDEM. However, the remaining 60% showed very different profiles. These findings challenge the assumption that one standard pattern fits all homes. Different temperature demand profiles have important implications for future peak power demands, particularly if domestic space heating is switched to electricity. It is also helpful for relating occupant demographics to appropriate forms of fabric retrofit.",

The observed spectrum is consistent with six magnetic modes and a single prominent gap, which is compatible with a single bilayer magnetic unit cell containing six spins. We model the magnon dispersion by linear spin-wave theory and find very good agreement with the domain-averaged spectrum of a spin-charge bilayer superstructure comprising one Fe3+-rich monolayer and one Fe2+-rich monolayer. These findings indicate the existence of polar bilayers in LuFe2O4. We also discuss a model of charge-segregated nonpolar bilayer order which we argue is not consistent with our data but which we cannot exclude definitively. Weak scattering observed below the magnon gap suggests that a fraction of the bilayers contain other combinations of charged monolayers not included in the model. Refined values for the dominant exchange interactions are reported.",

These PET-MRI scanners simultaneously acquire functional PET and anatomical or functional MRI data. As function and anatomy are not independent of one another the images to be reconstructed are likely to have shared structures. We aim to exploit this inherent structural similarity by reconstructing from both modalities in a joint reconstruction framework. The structural similarity between two modalities can be modelled in two different ways: edges are more likely to be at similar positions and/or to have similar orientations. We analyse the diffusion process generated by minimizing priors that encapsulate these different models. It turns out that the class of parallel level set priors always corresponds to anisotropic diffusion which is sometimes forward and sometimes backward diffusion. We perform numerical experiments where we jointly reconstruct from blurred Radon data with Poisson noise (PET) and under-sampled Fourier data with Gaussian noise (MRI). Our results show that both modalities benefit from each other in areas of shared edge information. The joint reconstructions have less artefacts and sharper edges compared to separate reconstructions and the \u21132-error can be reduced in all of the considered cases of under-sampling.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aims To investigate the causal role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides in coronary heart disease (CHD) using multiple instrumental variables for Mendelian randomization. Methods and results We developed weighted allele scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with established associations with HDL-C, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). For each trait, we constructed two scores. The first was unrestricted, including all independent SNPs associated with the lipid trait identified from a prior meta-analysis (threshold P < 2 \u00d7 10-6); and the second a restricted score, filtered to remove any SNPs also associated with either of the other two lipid traits at P \u2264 0.01. Mendelian randomization meta-analyses were conducted in 17 studies including 62,199 participants and 12,099 CHD events. Both the unrestricted and restricted allele scores for LDL-C (42 and 19 SNPs, respectively) associated with CHD. For HDL-C, the unrestricted allele score (48 SNPs) was associated with CHD (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.70), per 1 mmol/L higher HDL-C, but neither the restricted allele score (19 SNPs; OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.98) nor the unrestricted HDL-C allele score adjusted for triglycerides, LDL-C, or statin use (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.46) showed a robust association. For triglycerides, the unrestricted allele score (67 SNPs) and the restricted allele score (27 SNPs) were both associated with CHD (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.11 and 1.61; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.59, respectively) per 1-log unit increment. However, the unrestricted triglyceride score adjusted for HDL-C, LDL-C, and statin use gave an OR for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.75). Conclusion The genetic findings support a causal effect of triglycerides on CHD risk, but a causal role for HDL-C, though possible, remains less certain.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.There are a number of studies linking social capital to oral health among older adults, although the evidence base mainly relies on cross-sectional study designs. The possibility of reverse causality is seldom discussed, even though oral health problems could potentially lead to lower social participation. Furthermore, few studies clearly distinguish between the effects of different dimensions of social capital on oral health. The objective of the study was to examine the longitudinal associations between individual social capital and oral health among older adults. We analyzed longitudinal data from the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Structural social capital was operationalized using measures of social participation, and volunteering. Number of close ties and perceived emotional support comprised the functional dimension of social capital. Oral health measures were having no natural teeth (edentate vs. dentate), self-rated oral health and oral health-related quality of life. Time-lag and autoregressive models were used to explore the longitudinal associations between social capital and oral health. We imputed all missing data, using multivariate imputation by chained equations. We found evidence of bi-directional longitudinal associations between self-rated oral health, volunteering and functional social capital. Functional social capital was a strong predictor of change in oral health-related quality of life - the adjusted odds ratio of reporting poor oral health-related quality of life was 1.75 (1.33-2.30) for older adults with low vs. high social support. However in the reverse direction, poor oral health-related quality of life was not associated with changes in social capital. This suggests that oral health may not be a determinant of social capital. In conclusion, social capital may be a determinant of subjective oral health among older adults rather than edentulousness, despite many cross-sectional studies on the latter.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014.Introduction: Clinical trials have found that the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to reduce cigarette consumption results in significant declines in cigarette consumption and increases smokers' propensity to quit. However, observational \"real-world\" studies have found much smaller effects. This may be because of low levels of NRT use. This study examined the association between amount and duration of NRT use amongst those attempting to reduce their cigarette consumption with motivation to quit and cigarette consumption. Methods: Data came from 2,158 smokers who took part in the Smoking Toolkit Study. A representative survey of smokers in England aged 16. +. Results: Only 54.4% of patch users and 32.2% of non-transdermal NRT users reported using NRT with a frequency that would be expected to substantially influence cigarette consumption (4. + units per day for acute NRT forms and at least daily for transdermal patches). Those using the patch at or above this threshold smoked 1.3 cigarettes per day fewer than those using it below the threshold (p= 0.059), whilst those using non-transdermal NRT at or above this threshold smoked 0.9 cigarettes less per day (p= 0.022). In both cases, those using NRT more frequently had greater motivation to quit. Less than 1/5th of participants reported using a combination of NRT products. Use of NRT long-term was associated with lower motivation to quit and higher cigarette consumption. Conclusion: Smokers attempting to reduce their cigarette intake are underusing NRT and this is associated with cigarette consumption and motivation to quit. These findings may explain why population-based studies have failed to report similar findings to clinical trials.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing is a direct probe of the mean matter distribution around galaxies. The depth and sky coverage of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey yield statistically significant galaxy halomassmeasurements over a much wider range of stellarmasses (108.75 to 1011.3M) and redshifts (0.2 < z <0.8) than previous weak lensing studies. At redshift z ~ 0.5, the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) reaches a maximum of 4.0 \u00b1 0.2 per cent as a function of halo mass at ~1012.25M. We find, for the first time from weak lensing alone, evidence for significant evolution in the SHMR: the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 per cent at z ~ 0.7 to 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 per cent at z ~ 0.3, and shifts to lower stellar mass haloes. These evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies, and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which star formation is quenched 'downsizes' with cosmic time. In contrast, the SHMR of blue, star-forming galaxies is well fitted by a power law that does not evolve with time. This suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that is balanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve along the SHMR locus. The redshift dependence of the SHMR can be used to constrain the evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.",

Previously, using cell-type-specific anatomical projection mapping, it was shown that multimodal pathways converge onto individual cerebellar granule cells (Huang et al., 2013). Here we directly measure synaptic currents using in vivo patch-clamp recordings and confirm that a subset of single granule cells receive convergent functional multimodal (somatosensory, auditory, and visual) inputs via separate mossy fibers. Furthermore, we show that the integration of multimodal signals by granule cells can enhance action potential output. These recordings directly demonstrate functional convergence of multimodal signals onto single granule cells.",

As the OR is at risk of damage during epilepsy surgery, we measured its position relative to characteristic anatomical landmarks. Anatomical distances, DTI metrics and volume of the OR were investigated for age, gender and hemisphere effects. We observed changes in DTI metrics with age comparable to known trajectories in other white matter tracts. Left lateralization of DTI metrics was observed that showed a gender effect in lateralization. Sexual dimorphism of DTI metrics in the right hemisphere was also found. With respect to OR dimensions, volume was shown to be right lateralised and sexual dimorphism demonstrated for the extent of the left OR. The anatomical results presented for the OR have potentially important applications for neurosurgical planning.",

            "Abstract": "Objectives: To study muscle biopsy tissue from patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) in order to test the reliability of a score tool designed to quantify the severity of histological abnormalities when applied to biceps humeri in addition to quadriceps femoris. Additionally, to evaluate whether elements of the tool correlate with clinical measures of disease severity.Methods: 55 patients with JDM with muscle biopsy tissue and clinical data available were included. Biopsy samples (33 quadriceps, 22 biceps) were prepared and stained using standardised protocols. A Latin square design was used by the International Juvenile Dermatomyositis Biopsy Consensus Group to score cases using our previously published score tool. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and scorer agreement (\u03b1) by assessing variation in scorers' ratings. Scores from the most reliable tool items correlated with clinical measures of disease activity at the time of biopsy. Results Inter- and intraobserver agreement was good or high for many tool items, including overall assessment of severity using a Visual Analogue Scale. The tool functioned equally well on biceps and quadriceps samples. A modified tool using the most reliable score items showed good correlation with measures of disease activity.Conclusions: The JDM biopsy score tool has high interand intraobserver agreement and can be used on both biceps and quadriceps muscle tissue. Importantly, the modified tool correlates well with clinical measures of disease activity. We propose that standardised assessment of muscle biopsy tissue should be considered in diagnostic investigation and clinical trials in JDM.",

Thermal conductivity depends strongly on pressure, explaining the dynamical stability of super-plumes. The dependence on temperature and composition is weak in the deep mantle: our results exhibit saturation as the phonon mean free path approaches the interatomic spacing.

This has been attributed to changes in occupant behaviour, equipment use and fabric thermal performance that have not been reflected in updated benchmarks. The headline data available through DECs therefore may not offer sufficient insights or motivation to encourage identification of opportunities for energy reduction measures [Godoy-Shimizu, D., P. Armitage, K. Steemers, and T. Chenvidyakarn. 2011. \u201cUsing Display Energy Certificates to Quantify Schools\u2019 Energy Consumption.\u201d Building Research & Information 39: 535\u2013552]. Intelligent buildings could generate crowd-sourced databases of building energy data to offer these insights and provide sufficient disaggregation of energy data to identify systems or measures that impact energy consumption. Anonymous crowd-sourced data may also be able to offer contemporary benchmarks based on current data with sufficient depth to identify areas for improvement, help develop new methodologies for building design and operation and challenge orthodox architectural and engineering practice.

All rights reserved.Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common disease among men worldwide. It is important to know survival outcomes and prognostic factors for this disease. Recruitment for the largest therapeutic randomised controlled trial in PCa - the Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy: A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial (STAMPEDE) - includes men with newly diagnosed metastatic PCa who are commencing long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); the control arm provides valuable data for a prospective cohort. Objective Describe survival outcomes, along with current treatment standards and factors associated with prognosis, to inform future trial design in this patient group. Design, setting, and participants STAMPEDE trial control arm comprising men newly diagnosed with M1 disease who were recruited between October 2005 and January 2014. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) were reported by primary disease characteristics using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from multivariate Cox models. Results and limitations A cohort of 917 men with newly diagnosed M1 disease was recruited to the control arm in the specified interval. Median follow-up was 20 mo. Median age at randomisation was 66 yr (interquartile range [IQR]: 61-71), and median prostate-specific antigen level was 112 ng/ml (IQR: 34-373). Most men (n = 574; 62%) had bone-only metastases, whereas 237 (26%) had both bone and soft tissue metastases; soft tissue metastasis was found mainly in distant lymph nodes. There were 238 deaths, 202 (85%) from PCa. Median FFS was 11 mo; 2-yr FFS was 29% (95% CI, 25-33). Median OS was 42 mo; 2-yr OS was 72% (95% CI, 68-76). Survival time was influenced by performance status, age, Gleason score, and metastases distribution. Median survival after FFS event was 22 mo. Trial eligibility criteria meant men were younger and fitter than general PCa population. Conclusions Survival remains disappointing in men presenting with M1 disease who are started on only long-term ADT, despite active treatments being available at first failure of ADT.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 L'Enc\u00e9phale, ParisTheoretical background The borderline personality disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder that represents a high number of patients in a psychiatric adult service. Even if some therapies have shown to be effective in the therapeutic care of the borderline personality disorder they only target certain symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sadness, self-mutilation). The aim of this paper is to introduce a therapeutic model little known in France: the mentalization based therapy (MBT) developed in 2004 by Bateman and Fonagy. This therapeutic model apprehends the borderline personality disorder in all its complexity and is based on two main concepts: Bowlby's attachment theory and the concept of mentalization. The MBT is based on the hypothesis that a deficit of mentalization leads to the development of borderline disorder. The capacity of mentalization, also known as reflexive function, is acquired in infancy through interpersonal relationships, in particular those of attachment, and is the ability to understand the mental state (emotions, needs, thoughts, etc.) of oneself and others which underlies explicit behaviour. This reflexive capacity is of a better quality when the person has a secure attachment style. Indeed, borderline patients have, mainly, a deficit of mentalization capacity associated with an insecure attachment style. Thus, the main objective of the Bateman and Fonagy approach is to develop and reinforce the mentalization capacity through a therapeutic relationship as a secure base, a group therapy and the concept of insight. Therapy structure and techniques Classically, MBT is structured over a period of 18 months divided into 3 distinct phases distributed in two therapeutic axes: group and individual therapy. The initial phase aims to engage the patient in the therapy by evaluating attachment style, mentalization's ability, interpersonal functioning; providing psychoeducation about borderline disorder and establishing a therapeutic contract. To evaluate attachment style, the authors strongly recommend the use of the Relationship Scales Questionnaire. During the second phase, which includes individual and group therapy, the aim is to stimulate the capacity of mentalization through different techniques according to the patient's attachment style. These include therapeutic relationship, empathy, affect clarification and elaboration, positive and negative reinforcement. The final phase serves to review the patient's improvement and to prepare him progressively for the end of the therapy which can be experienced as an abandonment. Clinical trials of MBT and developments Effectiveness of MBT in treating borderline disorder has been shown in several studies with short and long term benefits. It can be adapted for other personality disorders and specific populations such as adolescents. Conclusion This article introduces the key concepts and aims of mentalization based treatment. The therapy is briefly described in its different phases and the various techniques are discussed. Clinical trials have shown that MBT is effective in treating borderline disorder in adolescent and adult populations. Despite the effectiveness of this therapy, it is difficult to set up and requires substantial resources. Interpersonal therapy based on attachment provides a therapeutic model focused on problematic areas which can offer an alternative therapy and reduce the fields of investigations.",

J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 103A: 658-670, 2015. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Although poly(butylene succinate)/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (PBSu/TCP) composites are biocompatible and allow the growth and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, cell attachment and adhesion to the PBSu-based substrates is often limited. To enhance cell adhesion and proliferation, we used a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) hydrolysis technique to generate a different degree of roughness on PBSu/TCP substrates with different PBSu:TCP ratios. The results showed that NaOH hydrolysis increased surface roughness of PBSu/TCP substrates in a concentration-dependent manner. Substrates with higher ratios of TCP:PBSu provided more porous topography after NaOH hydrolysis, with a substrate containing 40 wt % TCP (PBSu/TCP-6040) hydrolyzed with 1.5M NaOH (HPBSu/TCP-6040-1.5) showing the highest degree of roughness. As with the roughness, PBSu/TCP surface hydrophilicity was positively affected by the increasing NaOH concentration and TCP incorporation. Stem cells adhered best on HPBSu/TCP-6040-1.5 with three-dimensionally elongated cell extensions. Moreover, the HPBSu/TCP-6040-1.5 substrate most significantly facilitated stem cell actin cytoskeleton reorganization and vinculin-positive focal adhesion formation when compared with the other substrates tested. HPBSu/TCP-6040-1.5 also demonstrated the greatest increase in cell proliferation when compared with the other substrates studied. In conclusion, the results have shown that among various substrates tested, HPBSu/TCP-6040-1.5 provided the best support for stem cell adhesion and proliferation, suggesting its potential use in bone engineering.",

All rights reserved.The neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NCLs) constitute one of the most common groups of inherited neurodegenerative disorders in children but may also occur in adults. The childhood forms of NCL show an autosomal recessive inheritance, and are clinically characterized by progressive mental and motor deterioration and loss of vision, often accompanied by epileptic seizures and myoclonus. The rare adult forms usually present as dementia. The common denominator of all forms of NCL is the lysosomal accumulation of abnormal lipofuscin-like material in nerve cells, associated with progressive and selective neuronal loss. The NCLs are caused by more than 400 mutations in at least 13 different genes. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical picture and/or biopsy, and verified by enzyme tests and molecular genetic methods. Prenatal and carrier testing is increasingly available. Current research aims at bridging the gap between the multiple genomic defects and the strikingly uniform pattern of neurodegeneration, and developing new therapies.",

The booklet, 'Bowel Cancer Screening: The Facts' accompanies this invitation. Its primary aim is to inform potential participants about the aims, advantages and disadvantages of colorectal cancer screening. Objective: To provide detailed commentary on how individuals process the information contained within 'The Facts' booklet. Design, setting and participants: This study comprised of 18 interviews with individuals aged 45-60 and used a 'think-aloud' paradigm in which participants read aloud the booklet. Participant utterances (verbal statements made in response to researcher-led prompts) were transcribed and analysed using a combination of content and thematic analysis. Results: A total of 776 coded utterances were analysed (mean = 43.1 per person; range = 8-95). While overall comprehension was satisfactory, several problem areas were identified such as the use of complex unfamiliar terminology and the presentation of numerical information. Specific sections such as colonoscopy risk information evoked negative emotional responses. Participants made several suggestions for ways in which comprehension might be improved. Conclusion: Public perceptions of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme information materials indicated that specific aspects of the booklet were difficult to process. These materials may be an appropriate target to improve public understanding of the aims, benefits and disadvantages of colorectal cancer screening. These findings will contribute to a broader NIHR-funded project that aims to design a supplementary 'gist-based' information leaflet suitable for low literacy populations.",

            "Abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease, characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. SMA presents with a highly variable phenotype ranging from very severe to mild (type I-III). No cure for SMA is available at present. All forms of SMA are caused by homozygous loss of the functional survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. However, all patients have one or more copies of the SMN2 gene, nearly identical to SMN1. Both genes encode the SMN protein but the level produced by SMN2 is insufficient to protect from disease. Increasing SMN2 gene expression could be of considerable therapeutic importance. The aim of this study was to assess whether SMN2 gene expression can be increased by 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA). Fibroblast cell cultures from 16 SMA patients affected by different clinical severities were treated with PBA, and full-length SMN2 transcripts were measured by real-time PCR. In all cell cultures, except one, PBA treatment caused an increase in full-length SMN2 transcripts, ranging from 50 to 160% in type I and from 80 to 400% in type II and III cultures. PBA was found also effective in enhancing SMN protein levels and the number of SMN-containing nuclear structures (gems). These data show that SMN expression is considerably increased by PBA, and suggest that the compound, owing also to its favorable pharmacological properties, could be a good candidate for the treatment of SMA.",

In this paper, we review the genetic basis of FH and its impact on the clinical presentation. Recent Findings: Mutations in any of three genes (LDLR, APOB and PCSK9) are known to cause autosomal dominant FH, but a mutation can be found in only \u223c40% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH. In the remainder, a polygenic aetiology is most likely, due to the co-inheritance of common LDL-C-raising variants. The cardiovascular presentation and management of FH will differ between patients based on their underlying genetic factors. Summary: New genotyping methods such as next-generation sequencing will provide us with better understanding of the genetic architecture of FH.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 IEEE.Research on electric power systems has considered the impact of foreseeable plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) penetration on its regulation, planning, and operation. Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level. A case study highlights the effects of including the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) term in the objective function and calculates two metrics referred to as the expected value of aggregation and flexibility.",

            "Abstract": "Delamination causes a significant reduction in the load carrying capacity of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, which is a major concern to the aerospace and automotive industries. High performance FRPs are often subjected to dynamic loadings of different energy densities in their service life when strain rate, stress triaxiality, temperature, and mode of fracture can have a significant knock-down effect on the interfacial strength of plies in a laminate. This paper develops a predictive tool, in a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) framework, to assess delamination damage in FRPs under dynamic loading; the model takes into account the effects of dynamic energy density, mixed-mode fractures and temperature. The CDM model is formulated based on the fracture mechanics (FM) of decohesion and an advantage of the proposed model is that nearly all of the material parameters can be obtained directly through calibration to experimental data rather than numerical curve fitting of simulation results. The developed scheme is coded into a commercial FEA package (ABAQUS) through user-defined subroutines and the fidelity of the model is assessed by comparison with existing experimental data in the literature. The validated model is used to investigate delamination damage in a laminated FRP subject to projectile impact loading, where it will be shown that the extent of delamination damage through the thickness of the FRP structure is dependent upon different wave propagation scenarios. The proposed model provides a design platform for damage assessment caused by dynamic delamination and may be a useful tool for designing FRP composites with a greater impact tolerance.",

Patients and Method Demography, clinical features, and surgical outcomes were noted retrospectively for operations performed during the last 23 years. Results were analyzed using Fisher exact test and Woolf (logit) method with p value < 0.05 considered as significant. Results In total, 61 children (43 girls and 18 boys) underwent thyroidectomy for benign (70%) and malignant (30%) conditions. Median follow-up period was 1.4 years. In the benign group, 84% children had Graves disease and 16% had other conditions. In this study, 42% children had total, 22% had near-total, 27% had subtotal, and 9% had type 2 hemithyroidectomy. In the malignant group, 50% had multiple endocrine neoplasia, 33% had papillary, 11% had follicular cancer, and 6% had B-cell lymphoma. Fifty percent children had prophylactic thyroidectomy, 44% had total thyroidectomy plus lymphadenectomy, and 6% had hemithyroidectomy. At the time of surgery, children with benign conditions were older than those with malignancy (median, 12 vs. 7.5 years). There were no incidents of postoperative bleeding or infection. Hypocalcemia was significantly more frequent in the malignant group (39 vs. 9%, p value = 0.01). The type of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury was more serious in the benign group (one bilateral and one unilateral permanent injury) than in the malignant group (transient hoarseness in three). Overall rate of complications was higher for operations for malignancy (56 vs. 28%, p value = 0.07). In Graves disease, the subtotal thyroidectomies had a recurrence of 30% but no recurrence was seen following total or near-total thyroidectomy group (p value = 0.01). There was no recurrence in the malignant group. Children operated after 2000 were younger than those operated before 2000 (median age, 9 vs. 14 years). Malignant conditions were more common in children operated after 2000 in comparison to before 2000 (55 vs. 10%). Conclusion Benign conditions are commonest indications for thyroid surgery in children but the incidence of surgery for malignant conditions is rising. Overall rate of complications, especially hypocalcemia, is higher after surgery for malignancy but all cases of permanent RLN injury were in benign group. Total or near total thyroidectomy prevents recurrence of thyrotoxicosis and is an operation of choice for Graves disease.",

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground and Aim: Dental trauma is a common public health issue that can be associated with high costs and lifelong treatment. Children and parents should have the correct information regarding its management to reduce the potential long-term sequelae. Understanding their information seeking behaviour is therefore important to ensure that they are able to access, understand and retain the relevant information. The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the different ways that patients undertaking treatment for dental trauma, and their parents, look for relevant information, (b) their information needs, and (c) their preferred format of information. Material and Methods: This was a two-phase study: Phase I involved in-depth interviews with 10 patients who were currently undergoing treatment for dental trauma, and 11 parents. In phase II, the themes and sub-themes identified from the interviews were used to develop patient and parent questionnaires, which were distributed to all trauma patients and parents who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and who were attending the dental clinics from March to May 2014. Results: Patients and parents had different concerns immediately following the trauma, during treatment and in the long term, and they wanted different forms of information to answer their concerns. Reliability was the main issue about trusting the information available in the Internet, social media and other online sources. Therefore, patients preferred to obtain information verbally from their dentist, while parents preferred written information. Conclusion: Patients and parents have different information needs, and these also vary at different stages of treatment. It is therefore important to customize the way information is provided for each group accordingly.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background Synovial fluid analysis is an indispensable investigation to attain a diagnosis in a patient with acute hot swollen joint(s), septic arthritis in particular. A delay in appropriate early management results in serious undesired consequences. Methods We evaluated clinical practice at two teaching hospitals including 81 patients. We analysed medical records, laboratory pathology results and discharge summaries with regard to documentation of joint aspiration, blood cultures, antibiotic treatment and specialist referral. We then conducted a survey of 140 medical trainees to evaluate their self-reported competence at managing the acute hot swollen joint. Results We found that synovial aspiration and blood cultures were performed in only 42(52%) and 30(37%) patients, respectively, not in accord with current guidelines. Given trainee doctors are responsible for the early management of acute hot swollen joint(s), our survey reveal low self-reported levels of competence and confidence at managing acute hot swollen joint(s) in 72(52%) and 37(27%) respondents, respectively. Furthermore, 101(75%) trainees indicated a need for more training in joint aspiration. We also report that 13 of 15 hospitals surveyed in London and South East UK do not provide specific training on the management of the hot swollen joint and joint aspiration as part of their induction programme. Conclusions Early management of patients with hot swollen joint(s) to perform synovial fluid aspiration and blood cultures are not being done in accordance with guidelines. We suggest that the medical trainee curricula should incorporate joint aspiration skills as an 'essential procedure', to improve the trainee doctor's confidence and competence at managing acute hot swollen joint(s) to improve adherence to guidelines, and consequently, patient outcomes.",

London Underground is implementing a programme to install platform humps to remove vertical differences between the train and the platform. In order to properly design platform humps, this study empirically investigated the effects of the design factors of the ramps, namely the slope and cross-fall gradients, on disabled passengers. The investigation consisted of two experiments: one where 20 participants were asked to walk on simulated slopes, and the other where 25 participants were asked to board or alight from the simulated train from or onto the slopes. The slope gradients tested were 3\u00b70% (1:33), 5\u00b72% (1:19) and 6\u00b79% (1:14) with the cross-fall gradients 1\u00b75% (1:67), 2\u00b70% (1:50) and 2\u00b75% (1:40). The results showed that the slope gradient does not largely affect the participants\u2019 performance of longitudinal walking on the slopes or their subjective safety evaluation, but would cause additional difficulty for them to board/alight from the train from/onto the slope. This suggests that train doors should not stop next to the ramp. There was little evidence concerning the effects of the cross-fall gradient. The results provide useful information for designing platform humps.",

Here we review recent advances in the research of functional neural correlates of psychopathic personality traits in adults. We first provide a concise overview of functional neuroimaging findings in clinical samples diagnosed with the PCL-R. We then review studies with community samples that have focused on how individual differences in psychopathic traits (variously measured) relate to individual differences in brain function. Where appropriate, we draw parallels between the findings from these studies and those with clinical samples. Extant data suggest that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits show lower activity in affect-processing brain areas to emotional/salient stimuli, and that attenuated activity may be dependent on the precise content of the task. They also seem to show higher activity in regions typically associated with reward processing and cognitive control in tasks involving moral processing, decision making, and reward. Furthermore, affective-interpersonal and lifestyle-antisocial facets of psychopathy appear to be associated with different patterns of atypical neural activity. Neuroimaging findings from community samples typically mirror those observed in clinical samples, and largely support the notion that psychopathy is a dimensional construct.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Taylor & Francis.As the number of instruments applied in the area of energy and climate policy is rising, the issue of policy interaction needs to be explored further. This article analyses the interdependencies between the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the German feed-in tariffs (FITs) for renewable electricity in a quantitative manner using a bottom-up energy system model. Flexible modelling approaches are presented for both instruments, with which all impacts on the energy system can be evaluated endogenously. It is shown that national climate policy measures can have an effect on the supranational emissions trading system by increasing emission reduction in the German electricity sector by up to 79 MtCO2 in 2030. As a result, emission certificate prices decline by between 1.9 \u20ac/tCO2 and 6.1 \u20ac/tCO2 and the burden sharing between participating countries changes, but no additional emission reduction is achieved at the European level. This also implies, however, that the cost efficiency of such a cap-and-trade system is distorted, with additional costs of the FIT system of up to \u20ac320 billion compared with lower costs for ETS emission certificates of between \u20ac44 billion and \u20ac57 billion (cumulated over the period 2013\u20132020). Policy relevance In order to fulfil ambitious emission reduction targets a large variety of climate policy instruments are being implemented in Europe. While some, like the EU ETS, directly address CO2 emissions, others aim to promote specific low-carbon technologies. The quantitative analysis of the interactions between the EU ETS and the German FIT scheme for renewable sources in electricity generation presented in this article helps to understand the importance of such interaction effects. Even though justifications can be found for the implementation of both types of instrument, the impact of the widespread use of support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Europe needs to be taken into account when fixing the reduction targets for the EU ETS in order to ensure a credible long-term investment signal.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a disorder characterized by coronary heart disease (CHD) at young age. We aimed to apply an extreme sampling method to enhance the statistical power to identify novel genetic risk variants for CHD in individuals with FH. We selected cases and controls with an extreme contrast in CHD risk from 17 000 FH patients from the Netherlands, whose functional LDLR mutation was unequivocally established. The genome-wide association (GWA) study was performed on 249 very young FH cases with CHD and 217 old FH controls without CHD (above 65 years for males and 70 years of age for females) using the Illumina HumanHap550K chip. In the next stage, two independent samples (one from the Netherlands and one from Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom) of FH patients were used as replication samples. In the initial GWA analysis, we identified 29 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive associations with premature CHD (P<1 \u00d7 10 -4). We examined the association of these SNPs with CHD risk in the replication samples. After Bonferroni correction, none of the SNPs either replicated or reached genome-wide significance after combining the discovery and replication samples. Therefore, we conclude that the genetics of CHD risk in FH is complex and even applying an 'extreme genetics' approach we did not identify new genetic risk variants. Most likely, this method is not as effective in leveraging effect size as anticipated, and may, therefore, not lead to significant gains in statistical power.",

To date, no study has directly compared DH and NDH activations using an event-related visually guided dynamic power-grip paradigm with parametric (three) forces (GF) in healthy right-handed subjects. We implemented a hierarchical statistical approach aimed to: (i) identify the main effect networks engaged when using either hand; (ii) characterise DH/NDH responses at different GFs; (iii) assess contralateral (CL)/IL-specific and hemisphere-specific activations. Beyond confirming previously reported results, this study demonstrated that increasing GF has an effect on motor response that is contextualised also by the use of DH or NDH. Linear analysis revealed increased activations in sensorimotor areas, with additional increased recruitments of subcortical and cerebellar areas when using the NDH. When looking at CL/IL-specific activations, CL sensorimotor areas and IL cerebellum were activated with both hands. When performing the task with the NDH, several areas were also recruited including the CL cerebellum. Finally, there were hand-side-independent activations of nonmotor-specific areas in the right and left hemispheres, with the right hemisphere being involved more extensively in sensori-motor integration through associative areas while the left hemisphere showing greater activation at higher GF. This study shows that the functional networks subtending DH/NDH power-grip visuomotor functions are qualitatively and quantitatively distinct and this should be taken into consideration when performing fMRI studies, particularly when planning interventions in patients with specific impairments.

The paper commences by considering evidence on the economic value of older people to society. This shows that older people make a net contribution through expenditure in shops, employment, voluntary work, childcare and taxation which exceeds their cost to the taxpayer. The assumptions underlying the calculations are examined and found to be robust. The patterns of travel of older people are examined and found to be consistent with the estimates of the economic contribution of older people. Mobility provides many intrinsic benefits for older people, facilitating independence, reducing social isolation and physical activity. Evidence from the examples of the ability to drive and providing free bus travel is considered. Then the contribution of older people to society in future is examined and how travel contributes to this. It is shown that changes in older people[U+05F3]s mobility would affect their contribution to society. Ways in which the mobility of older people could be increased are identified.",

The focus is on the project manager as leader in an attempt to deepen understanding of the effect of a project manager\u2019s emotional intelligence (EI) on the quality of interpersonal communication with their followers, being other members of the project team. While a project manager\u2019s EI, with its associated emotional competencies, is often seen as critical in achieving good relationships with members of the project team, it remains a largely understudied concept, particularly in construction projects. Primary data collected using a series of analytical surveys and live observations of site-based project meetings was used to examine the relationship between a project manager\u2019s emotional competencies, particularly sensitivity and expressiveness, and leader\u2013follower chemistry. Overall, 68 construction professionals participated in the study. The findings suggest that a project manager\u2019s emotional sensitivity and expressiveness (particularly head gestures) may explain variance in the quality of leader\u2013follower chemistry. Based on the empirical evidence in the context of team communication, a leader\u2013follower chemistry model is introduced, which emphasizes the importance of leaders\u2019 emotional sensitivity and expressiveness in a leader\u2013follower communication dyad. The model may be particularly salient in complex project networks with a large number of prominent actors.",

This is the analogue for bad-reduction varieties of the finite-polynomial cohomology of (Besser, Invent Math 142(2):397\u2013434, 2000); and we use this cohomology theory to give formulae for p-adic regulator maps, extending the results of (Besser, Invent Math 142(2):397\u2013434, 2000; Besser, Israel J Math 120(1):335\u2013360, 2000; Besser, Israel J Math 190(1):29\u201366, 2012) to varieties over p-adic fields, without assuming any good reduction hypotheses.",

In this study, we used novel inorganic microfibres guided by phosphate glass (PG). PG fibres (PGfs) were aligned on compressed collagen that was rolled into a nerve conduit. In vitro tests confirmed that adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons showed active neurite outgrowth along the fibres, with a maximum number and length of neurites being significantly higher than those cultured on tissue culture plastic. In vivo experiments with nerve conduits that either contained PGfs (PGf/Col) or lacked them (Col) were conducted on transected sciatic nerves of rats for up to 12weeks. One week after implantation, the PGf/Col group showed many axons extending along the scaffold, whereas the Col group showed none. Eight weeks after implantation, the PGf/Col group exhibited greater recovery of plantar muscle atrophy than the Col group. Electrophysiological studies revealed that some animals in the PGf/Col group at 6 and 7weeks post-implantation (5.3% and 15.8%, respectively) showed compound muscle action potential. The Col group over the same period showed no response. Motor function also showed faster recovery in the PGf/Col group compared to the Col group up to 7weeks. However, there was no significant difference in the number of axons, muscle atrophy or motor and sensory functions between the two groups at 12weeks post-implantation. In summary, phosphate glass fibres can promote directional growth of axons in cases of peripheral nerve injury by acting as physical guides.",

Setting: Paediatric, tertiary care hospital in the United Kingdom. Participants: 93 children (aged between 3 days and 16 years), and 22 physiotherapists (10 specialist respiratory physiotherapists) were recruited to the study. Interventions: Recruited children received two physiotherapy treatments during a single day, one delivered by a non-respiratory physiotherapist, the other by a specialist respiratory physiotherapist in a randomised order. Selection, delivery and effects of techniques were recorded for each treatment. Outcome measures: Primary outcomes were selection and application of treatment components. Secondary outcomes included respiratory effects (in terms of changes in flow, volume and pressure) of selected treatment components. Results: Both non-respiratory on-call physiotherapists and specialist respiratory physiotherapists used combinations of saline instillation, manual lung inflations, chest wall vibrations and endotracheal suction during treatments. However specialist respiratory physiotherapists used combinations of chest wall vibrations with suction, and recruitment manoeuvres, significantly more frequently than non-respiratory on-call physiotherapists (92% vs 52%, and 87% vs 46% of treatments respectively, P<. 0.001). Chest wall vibrations delivered by non-respiratory on-call physiotherapists were 15% less effective at increasing peak expiratory flow. Conclusion: Clinically important differences between non-respiratory and specialist respiratory physiotherapists' treatment outcomes may be related to differences in the selection and application of techniques. This suggests an important training need for non-respiratory on-call physiotherapists, particularly in the effective delivery of physiotherapy techniques.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Human ancestors first modified stones into tools 2.6 million years ago, initiating a cascading increase in technological complexity that continues today. A parallel trend of brain expansion during the Paleolithic has motivated over 100 years of theorizing linking stone toolmaking and human brain evolution, but empirical support remains limited. Our study provides the first direct experimental evidence identifying likely neuroanatomical targets of natural selection acting on toolmaking ability. Subjects received MRI and DTI scans before, during, and after a 2-year Paleolithic toolmaking training program. White matter fractional anisotropy (FA) showed changes in branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus leading into left supramarginal gyrus, bilateral ventral precentral gyri, and right inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. FA increased from Scan 1\u20132, a period of intense training, and decreased from Scan 2\u20133, a period of reduced training. Voxel-based morphometry found a similar trend toward gray matter expansion in the left supramarginal gyrus from Scan 1\u20132 and a reversal of this effect from Scan 2\u20133. FA changes correlated with training hours and with motor performance, and probabilistic tractography confirmed that white matter changes projected to gray matter changes and to regions that activate during Paleolithic toolmaking. These results show that acquisition of Paleolithic toolmaking skills elicits structural remodeling of recently evolved brain regions supporting human tool use, providing a mechanistic link between stone toolmaking and human brain evolution. These regions participate not only in toolmaking, but also in other complex functions including action planning and language, in keeping with the hypothesized co-evolution of these functions.",

We show that the formalism of quantum theory can be reconstructed from four natural postulates, which do not refer to the mathematical formalism, but only to the information-theoretic content of the physical theory. Our starting point is to assume that there exist physical events (such as measurement outcomes) that happen probabilistically, yielding the mathematical framework of \u201cconvex state spaces\u201d. Then, quantum theory can be reconstructed by assuming that (i) global states are determined by correlations between local measurements, (ii) systems that carry the same amount of information have equivalent state spaces, (iii) reversible time evolution can map every pure state to every other, and (iv) positivity of probabilities is the only restriction on the possible measurements.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2015.Planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity to separate the diffuse emission components of the inner Galaxy. The purpose of the paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components in the strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarify the relationship between the various components. The region of the Galactic plane covered is l = 300\u00b0 \u2192 0\u00b0 \u2192 60\u00b0 wherestar-formation is highest and the emission is strong enough to make meaningful component separation. The latitude widths in this longitude range lie between 1 and 2, which correspond to FWHM z-widths of 100-200 pc at a typical distance of 6 kpc. The four emission components studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwave emission (AME), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. These components are identified by constructing spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at positions along the Galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of Planck (28.4-857GHz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3 GHz plus WMAP data at 23-94 GHz, along with far-infrared (FIR) data from COBE-DIRBE and IRAS. The free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (RRL) data. AME is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on the Galactic plane in the frequency range 20-40 GHz with a width in latitude similar to that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45 \u00b1 1% of the total 28.4 GHz emission in the longitude range l = 300\u00b0 \u2192 0\u00b0 \u2192 60\u00b0. The free-free component is the narrowest, reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced by the narrow distribution of OB stars. It is the dominant emission on the plane between 60 and 100 GHz. RRLs from this ionized gas are used to assess its distance, leading to a free-free z-width of FWHM \u2248 100 pc. The narrow synchrotron component has a low-frequency brightness spectral index \u03b2synch \u2248 -2.7 that is similar to the broad synchrotron component indicating that they are both populated by the cosmic ray electrons of the same spectral index. The width of this narrow synchrotron component is significantly larger than that of the other three components, suggesting that it is generated in an assembly of older supernova remnants that have expanded to sizes of order 150 pc in 3 \u00d7 105 yr; pulsars of a similar age have a similar spread in latitude. The thermal dust is identified in the SEDs with average parameters of Tdust = 20.4 \u00b1 0.4 K, \u03b2FIR = 1.94 \u00b1 0.03 (> 353 GHz), and \u03b2mm = 1.67 \u00b1 0.02 (< 353 GHz). The latitude distributions of gamma-rays, CO, and the emission in high-frequency Planck bands have similar widths, showing that they are all indicators of the total gaseous matter on the plane in the inner Galaxy.",

Despite their different historical periods of production (1949 and 1986, respectively), each text deploys key aspects of the seemingly autobiographical text (recounting the event of birth, significance of the family name, dawning sense of sexual desire and identity) in order to portray a sense of being at odds with prevailing strictures of belonging and good taste. Despite foregrounding a sense of 'misfitting', which is primarily located in experiences of, and related to, gay sexuality, the texts also testify to the enduring appeal and imposed potency of the socially sanctioned desire for straightforward autobiographical selfhood. Taken together, the texts suggest a reading which foregrounds shifting textual pluralities of reimagined, transitory, textual forms of selfhood rather than a named singular self.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.Rationale: A high proportion of influenza infections are asymptomatic. Animal and human challenge studies and observational studies suggest T cells protect against disease among those infected, but the impact of T-cell immunity at the population level is unknown. Objectives: To investigate whether naturally preexisting T-cell responses targeting highly conserved internal influenza proteins could provide cross-protective immunity against pandemic and seasonal influenza. Methods: We quantified influenza A(H3N2) virus-specific T cells in a population cohort during seasonal and pandemic periods between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up included paired serology, symptom reporting, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) investigation of symptomatic cases. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,414 unvaccinated individuals had baseline T-cell measurements (1,703 participant observation sets). T-cell responses to A(H3N2) virus nucleoprotein (NP) dominated and strongly cross-reacted with A(H1N1)pdm09 NP (P < 0.001) in participants lacking antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09. Comparison of paired preseason and postseason sera (1,431 sets) showed 205 (14%) had evidence of infection based on fourfold influenza antibody titer rises. The presence of NP-specific T cells before exposure to virus correlated with less symptomatic, PCR-positive influenza A (overall adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.68; P = 0.005,during pandemic [P = 0.047] and seasonal [P = 0.049] periods). Protection was independent of baseline antibodies. Influenza-specific T-cell responses were detected in 43%, indicating a substantial population impact. Conclusions: Naturally occurring cross-protective T-cell immunity protects against symptomatic PCR-confirmed disease in those with evidence of infection and helps to explain why many infections do not cause symptoms. Vaccines stimulating T cells may provide important cross-protective immunity.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2005 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.Speech is a striking human skill, both in terms of the precision of the motor acts which production involves, and the complexity of the acoustic signal that we perceive as meaningful words. Our perception of speech is both robust and flexible: We are able to follow speakers with a wide variety of different accents and moods, in very adverse auditory environments. This perceptual ability is all the more impressive when the actual nature of the speech signal is considered. Speakers do not produce simple strings of regular phonemes which are then sequenced into words by the listener. There is a lot of variability in the acoustic signal, resulting from speaker differences, co-articulation and assimilation effects. This variability precludes a simple linear mapping between the acoustic signal and the identity of the phone that is expressed (Bailey and Summerfield, 1980). It is also important to note that the \u2018surface\u2019, acoustic representation of speech is not wholly separable from the intended meaning: Coarticulation has been suggested to have a communicative quality (Whalen, 1990) in addition to its role in making speech production more fluid, assimilation effects are constrained by syntactical features (Hawkins, 2003), prosody influences the linguistic information in speech at many levels. The aim of this chapter is to delineate the neural systems involved in speech perception, rather than the whole language system. I argue that neurally, robust and flexible speech perception is supported by multiple, parallel processing streams. I argue that these streams bear some relation to the anatomy of primate auditory cortex. I also address the basis of functional asymmetries between the left and right temporal 142lobes, which have often been invoked to explain the left hemispheric dominance in speech perception.",

Correct responses were associated with higher education (P <.05) and longer duration of HIV diagnosis (P <.05). A lack of knowledge was observed in 40% of respondents who believed HIV and AIDS were the same and 70% of respondents who believed ARV medications cured HIV. Greater embarrassment of living with HIV was associated with female gender (P <.05) and lower education (P <.05). Patients were concerned over ARV medication use (27%) and its side effects (38%).

In this article, we review the literature regarding the diagnostic utility of postmortem radiography, US, CT and MRI in this clinical setting. There is limited direct evidence on the diagnostic utility of any of these techniques, apart from postmortem MRI, which when combined with other noninvasive investigations, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for many foetal postmortem diagnoses. The main disadvantages of postmortem MRI include the longer duration of imaging, the need for appropriate training in the interpretation of normal postmortem changes, and possible non-diagnostic imaging examinations in early gestation foetuses. As less-invasive autopsy becomes increasingly available, the true utility of these techniques will evolve, and clinical guidelines for maximal diagnostic yield can be developed.",

However, until now technological limitations have hindered elucidation of the contribution of all clinically relevant disease genes to DCM phenotypes in larger cohorts. We now utilized next-generation sequencing to overcome these limitations and screened all DCM disease genes in a large cohort. Methods and results In this multi-centre, multi-national study, we have enrolled 639 patients with sporadic or familial DCM. To all samples, we applied a standardized protocol for ultra-high coverage next-generation sequencing of 84 genes, leading to 99.1% coverage of the target region with at least 50-fold and a mean read depth of 2415. In this well characterized cohort, we find the highest number of known cardiomyopathy mutations in plakophilin-2, myosin-binding protein C-3, and desmoplakin. When we include yet unknown but predicted disease variants, we find titin, plakophilin-2, myosin-binding protein-C 3, desmoplakin, ryanodine receptor 2, desmocollin-2, desmoglein-2, and SCN5A variants among the most commonly mutated genes. The overlap between DCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and channelopathy causing mutations is considerably high. Of note, we find that >38% of patients have compound or combined mutations and 12.8% have three or even more mutations. When comparing patients recruited in the eight participating European countries we find remarkably little differences in mutation frequencies and affected genes. Conclusion This is to our knowledge, the first study that comprehensively investigated the genetics of DCM in a large-scale cohort and across a broad gene panel of the known DCM genes. Our results underline the high analytical quality and feasibility of Next-Generation Sequencing in clinical genetic diagnostics and provide a sound database of the genetic causes of DCM.",

Pressure algometry has been validated in the clinic for assessment of bone-related pain in humans. In animal models of bone-related pain, we have validated the Randall Selitto behavioural test for assessment of acute and pathological bone pain and compared the outcome with more traditional pain-related behaviour measures. Methods Randall Selitto pressure algometry was performed over the anteromedial part of the tibia in na\u00efve rats, sham-operated rats, and rats inoculated with MRMT-1 carcinoma cells in the left tibia, and the effect of morphine was investigated. Randall Selitto measures of cancer-induced bone pain were supplemented by von Frey testing, weight-bearing and limb use test. Contribution of cutaneous nociception to Randall Selitto measures were examined by local anaesthesia. Results Randall Selitto pressure algometry over the tibia resulted in reproducible withdrawal thresholds, which were dose-dependently increased by morphine. Cutaneous nociception did not contribute to Randall Selitto measures. In cancer-bearing animals, compared with sham, significant differences in pain-related behaviours were demonstrated by the Randall Selitto test on day 17 and 21 post-surgery. A difference was also demonstrated by von Frey testing, weight-bearing and limb use tests. Conclusion Our results indicate that pressure applied by the Randall Selitto algometer on a region, where the bone is close to the skin, may offer a way to measure bone-related pain in animal models and could provide a supplement to the traditional behavioural tests and a means to study deep pain.",

This study examined feasibility and acceptability, and provided an indication of behavioural impact, of a telephone-based, multimodal health behaviour intervention for CRC survivors. Method: Participants were recruited from five London hospitals. Patients (. n=29) who had recently completed treatment for CRC participated in a 12week intervention. Behavioural goals were to increase physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, and reduce consumption of red/processed meat and alcohol. Self-report measures of PA and diet were completed in all patients, supplemented by objective measures in a sub-set. Results: Uptake of the study when patients were approached by a researcher was high (72%), compared with 27% contacted by letter. Methods for identifying eligible patients were not optimal. Study completion rate was high (79%), and completers evaluated the intervention favourably. Significant improvements were observed in objectively-measured activity (+70min/week; p=.004). Gains were seen in diet:+3F&V portions a day (. p<.001),-147g of red meat a week (. p=.013),-0.83 portions of processed meat a week (. p=.002). Changes in serum vitamin levels were not statistically significant, but the small sample size provides limited power. Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (. p<.001) was observed. Conclusion: An intervention combining print materials and telephone consultations was feasible and acceptable, and associated with improvements in PA, diet and quality of life.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.The major technical problems faced by stand-alone fluidized bed gasifiers (FBG) for waste-to gas applications are intrinsically related to the composition and physical properties of waste materials, such as RDF. The high quantity of ash and volatile material in RDF can provide a decrease in thermal output, create high ash clinkering, and increase emission of tars and CO2, thus affecting the operability for clean syngas generation at industrial scale. By contrast, a two-stage process which separates primary gasification and selective tar and ash conversion would be inherently more forgiving and stable. This can be achieved with the use of a separate plasma converter, which has been successfully used in conjunction with conventional thermal treatment units, for the ability to 'polish' the producer gas by organic contaminants and collect the inorganic fraction in a molten (and inert) state. This research focused on the performance analysis of a two-stage fluid bed gasification-plasma process to transform solid waste into clean syngas. Thermodynamic assessment using the two-stage equilibrium method was carried out to determine optimum conditions for the gasification of RDF and to understand the limitations and influence of the second stage on the process performance (gas heating value, cold gas efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency), along with other parameters. Comparison with a different thermal refining stage, i.e. thermal cracking (via partial oxidation) was also performed. The analysis is supported by experimental data from a pilot plant.",

Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of NASEN.Much relevant internet-mediated information is inaccessible to people with learning disabilities because of difficulties in navigating the web. This paper reports on the methods undertaken to determine how information can be optimally presented for this cohort. Qualitative work is outlined where attributes relating to site layout affecting usability were elicited. A study comparing web sites of different design layouts exhibiting these attributes is discussed, with the emphasis on methodology. Eight interfaces were compared using various combinations of menu position (vertical or horizontal), text size and the absence or presence of images to determine which attributes of a site have the greatest performance impact. Study participants were also asked for their preferences, via a 'smiley-face' rating scale and simple interviews. 'Acquiescence bias' was minimised by avoiding polar ('yes/no') interrogatives, achieved by asking participants to compare layouts (such as horizontal versus vertical menu), with reasons coaxed from those able to articulate them. Preferred designs were for large text and images. This was the reverse of those facilitating fastest retrieval times, a discrepancy due to preferences being judged on aesthetic considerations. Design recommendations that reconcile preference and performance findings are offered. These include using a horizontal menu, juxtaposing images and text, and reducing text from sentences to phrases, thus facilitating preferred large text without increasing task times.",

Active play (effective) mean HR was 155 \u00b1 14 bpm (80 \u00b1 7.5% HRmax) with the majority of time (64%) spent exercising at intensities >80% HRmax. Mean (SD) sweat rates during games were 1.02 \u00b1 0.07 L \u00b7 h-1 and on 56% of occasions fluid intake matched or exceeded sweat loss. A significant relationship was observed between estimated sweat loss and fluid intake during exercise (r2 = .121, p = .001). Mean sweat sodium concentration was 38 \u00b1 10 mmol \u00b7 L-1, with significant associations observed between player sweat rates and time spent exercising at intensities >90% HRmax (r2 = .181, p = .001).

All rights reserved.Combining place and fiction my recent project London Short Stories takes well-known institutions, epochs and lifestyles from a series of sites across the city and renders them fantastic in a string of architectural short stories. The medium is an intersection of paper assemblages and text, occupying a liminal territory where familiar characters find themselves in unexpected environments and places transform into active protagonists. The short stories explore whether narrative retains any relevance to modern architecture and urban design and if so, how meaning and symbolism can be incorporated into the built environment, offering us ways to reinvent ourselves and especially our perspectives on new environments. The urban designs depict a vision of the city that is immoral, anarchic, and unscientific.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We explore the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of a sample of 49 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at 0.9 < z < 1.5. We base our analysis on intermediate resolution spectro-photometric data in the GOODS-N field taken in the near-infrared and optical with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism and the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources. To constrain the slope of the IMF, we have measured the TiO2 spectral feature, whose strength depends strongly on the content of low-mass stars, as well as on stellar age. Using ultraviolet to near-infrared individual and stacked spectral energy distributions, we have independently estimated the stellar ages of our galaxies. Knowing the age of the stellar population, we interpret the strong differences in the TiO2 feature as an IMF variation. In particular, for the heaviest z \u223c 1 MQGs (M > 1011 M\u2299), we find an average age of 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 Gyr and a bottom-heavy IMF (\u0393b = 3.2 \u00b1 0.2). Lighter MQGs (2 \u00d7 1010 < M < 1011 M\u2299) at the same redshift are younger on average (1.0 \u00b1 0.2 Gyr) and present a shallower IMF slope (\u0393b = 2.7-0.4+0.3). Our results are in good agreement with the findings about the IMF slope in early-type galaxies of similar mass in the present-day universe. This suggests that the IMF, a key characteristic of the stellar populations in galaxies, is bottom-heavier for more massive galaxies and has remained unchanged in the last \u223c8 Gyr.",

Few researchers have, however, attempted to outline such principles as they might apply to sign languages. As a consequence, some sign language dictionaries and lexical databases appear to be mixed collections of phonetic, phonological, morphological, and lexical variants of lexical signs (e.g. Brien 1992) which have not addressed what may be termed as the lemma dilemma. In this paper, we outline the lemmatisation practices used in the creation of BSL SignBank (Fenlon, Cormier et al. 2014), a lexical database and dictionary of British Sign Language based on signs identified within the British Sign Language Corpus (http://www.bslcorpusproject.org). We argue that the principles outlined here should be considered in the creation of any sign language lexical database and ultimately any sign language dictionary and reference grammar.",

PLGA microparticles were produced adopting water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) solvent evaporation technique and were investigated for surface morphology, particle size, encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and in-vitro release profile. Porous surface morphologies with a narrow size distribution were observed when employing 0.5ml internal aqueous phase; 23.04\u03bcm (\u00b10.98), 15.05\u03bcm (\u00b10.27) and 22.89\u03bcm (\u00b10.41) for PVA, Tween 80 and oleic acid. Porous microparticles exhibited increased size and reduction in EE% with increasing internal aqueous phase, with non-porous microparticles produced when adopting 2.0ml internal aqueous phase. The selection of stabilizer influences the size of the pores formed thus offers potential for the aerodynamic properties of the microparticles to be manipulated to achieve suitable aerosolization characteristics for pulmonary delivery of proteins.",

In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how scrambled sentence priming can impact on mimicry behavior. Sentences involving pro/ antisocial events from a first/third-person point of view were presented in short blocks, followed by a reaction-time assessment of mimicry. Behavioral results showed that both prosociality and viewpoint impact on mimicry, and fMRI analysis showed this effect is implemented by anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC). We suggest that social primes may subtly modulate processing in amPFC in a manner linked to the later behavior, and that this same region also implements the top-down control of mimicry responses. This priming may be linked to processing of self-schemas in amPFC. Our findings demonstrate how social priming can be studied with fMRI, and have important implications for our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of prime-to-behavior effects as well as for current theories in social psychology.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives Assessment of dental treatment needs has predominantly been based on the normative approach, despite its numerous limitations. The sociodental approach is a more rational method of needs assessment as it incorporates broader concepts of health and needs and behavioural propensity. This study compares estimates of periodontal dental treatment needs and workforce requirements for different skill mixes using normative and sociodental approaches among a sample of adults in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out on 732 Malaysian adults aged 30-54 years. Subjects' normative and sociodental needs for periodontal treatment were assessed using WHO criteria, an oral health-related quality of life measure (the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances index), and behavioural propensity measures for toothbrushing and smoking behaviour. The proportion of subjects requiring periodontal treatment and the numbers of dentists and dental therapists required to treat them using the normative and sociodental approach were compared using different skill mix models. Results The estimates of need for periodontal treatment using the sociodental approach were 90% lower than the respective estimates using the normative need method. Overall, 14.43 dentists would be required per 100 000 people using the normative approach compared to 2.32 for the sociodental approach. When skill mix models were used, the number of dentists required decreased by almost 70% when more periodontal procedures were delegated to dental therapists. Conclusions Using the sociodental approach resulted in much lower estimates of dental need and workforce requirements for periodontal treatment than using the normative method. Using dental therapists markedly reduced the numbers of dentists needed for periodontal treatment.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.Cell culture titres are expected to increase still further over the forthcoming years. This imposes challenges for downstream processing including the potential need to use larger volumes of chromatography resins. Such a move could create throughput bottlenecks because of the compressible nature of many commercially available resins, which makes the operation of columns with diameters beyond 2. m infeasible due to resin collapse. The use of cylindrical inserts of negligible thickness has been proposed in the literature as a way to enhance the level of wall support, allowing higher superficial flow velocities to be applied and hence larger diameter columns to be used. In this study, a structural mechanics model has been developed to evaluate the effect of inserts on the column pressure drop and flow characteristics. Simulations were shown to be in good agreement with published experimental data. The model was then used to predict the effect of insert number, diameter, height and roughness on critical velocity of manufacturing scale columns.",

A corollary is that the Gromov-Witten invariants (without descendants) of symplectic 4-manifolds can always be computed as a signed and weighted count of honest J-holomorphic curves for generic tame J: in particular, each such invariant is an integer divided by a weighting factor that depends only on the divisibility of the corresponding homology class.

In so doing, we answer a question of Hayman by showing that all such solutions have finite order. Apart from special choices of the coefficient functions, the general solution is not meromorphic and contains movable branch points. For some choices for the coefficient functions, the equation admits a one-parameter family of nonrational meromorphic solutions. Nevanlinna theory is used to show that all such solutions have been found and allows us to avoid issues that can arise from the fact that resonances can occur at arbitrarily high orders.

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate bone regeneration following application of a novel biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP I) composed of microstructured granules of 90% \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP)/10% hydroxyapatite (HA) compared to BCP non-microstructured biphasic calcium phosphate with a composite of 60% hydroxyapatite/40% \u03b2-TCP (BCP II) and a deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) at surgically created defects in the mandible of minipigs in a combined approach with guided bone regeneration (GBR). Material and methods: Sixteen minipigs were used for the study. Lower premolars P2, P3, P4 and first molar M1 were extracted. Following 3 months of healing, two defects with a width and depth of 7 mm were created bilaterally in the mandible. The different grafting materials were randomly placed in the created defects and covered by means of a collagen membrane. After 3 and 8 weeks, biopsies were sampled. All specimens were evaluated with descriptive histology and histomorphometric evaluations complemented by micro-CT scan analysis. Results: All three biomaterials presented with higher bone volume at 8 weeks compared to 3 weeks (P < 0.0442). BCP I and DBBM demonstrated a significant higher amount of bone formation compared to BCP II at 8 weeks (P < 0.0328). BCP I also demonstrated a significant higher percentage of remaining graft volume compared to the other test groups both at 3 and 8 weeks (P < 0.0001 to P < 0.0003). Congruently, defects containing BCP I showed a significant higher amount of mineralized tissue compared to the other groups. Conclusions: All the three test materials performed well with regard to bone formation at 8 weeks. BCP I showed significant higher amounts of newly formed bone despite a higher remaining graft volume compared to the other groups. With regard to the regenerative outcome, all the three materials can be recommended for clinical use.",

We aimed to investigate mortality in a large epidemiologically characterized cohort of individuals with firstepisode psychosis compared with the general population and to determine clinical and social risk factors for premature death. All 557 individuals with first-episode psychosis initially identified in 2 areas (Southeast London and Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom) were traced over a 10-year period in the \u00c6SOP-10 study. Compared with the general population, all-cause (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-4.9), natural-cause (SMR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.7) and unnaturalcause (SMR 13.3, 95% CI 8.7-20.4) mortality was very high. Illicit drug use was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (adj. rate ratio [RR] 2.31, 95% CI 1.06-5.03). Risk of natural-cause mortality increased with a longer time to first remission (adj. RR 6.61, 95% CI 1.33-32.77). Family involvement at first contact strongly reduced risk of unnatural-cause mortality (adj. RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.69). Our findings suggest that the mortality gap in people with psychotic disorders remains huge and may be wider for unnatural-cause mortality than previously reported. Efforts should now focus on further understanding and targeting these tractable clinical and social risk factors of excess mortality. Early intervention and dual diagnosis services may play a key role in achieving more rapid remission and carer involvement and addressing substance use problems to reduce excess mortality in psychosis.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.We explore the relationship between development policies, finance and growth as approached by New Structural Economics (NSE) with special reference to Transition Economies (TEs). On a sample of 164 economies for 1963\u20132009, our analysis confirms NSE propositions that the type of development policies, as captured by the Technology Choice Index (TCI), has a significant effect on long-term growth. However, this differs for TEs as a whole and its subgroups. Further to this, using a sample of 94 countries for 1985\u20132009, we provide a first empirical test of the relationship between growth, TCI and financial structure distortions and we show that there is a negative relationship between financial distortions and TCI on the one hand and medium-term growth on the other hand. We also find that the negative effect of a higher ratio of TCI on medium-term growth is partly mitigated, although not eliminated, by moderate level of financial sector distortions. This points towards some positive externalities of simultaneous financial and industrial sector distortions, at least in the medium run. However, TEs are shown to differ from the rest of the sample as financial distortions play a more pronounced direct negative effect on medium-term growth in these countries.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Woolf et al.; licensee BioMed Central.Background: Since 2007 junior doctors in the UK have had to make major career decisions at a point when previously many had not yet chosen a specialty. This study examined when doctors in this new system make specialty choices, which factors influence choices, and whether doctors who choose a specialty they were interested in at medical school are more confident in their choice than those doctors whose interests change post-graduation. Methods: Two cohorts of students in their penultimate year at one medical school (n = 227/239) were asked which specialty interested them as a career. Two years later, 210/227 were sent a questionnaire measuring actual specialty chosen, confidence, influence of perceptions of the specialty and experiences on choice, satisfaction with medicine, personality, self-efficacy, and demographics. Medical school and post-graduation choices in the same category were deemed 'stable'. Predictors of stability, and of not having chosen a specialty, were calculated using bootstrapped logistic regression. Differences between specialties on questionnaire factors were analysed. Results: 50% responded (n = 105/277; 44% of the 239 Year 4 students). 65% specialty choices were 'stable'. Factors univariately associated with stability were specialty chosen, having enjoyed the specialty at medical school or since starting work, having first considered the specialty earlier. A regression found doctors who chose psychiatry were more likely to have changed choice than those who chose general practice. Confidence in the choice was not associated with stability. Those who chose general practice valued lifestyle factors. A psychiatry choice was associated with needing a job and using one's intellect to help others. The decision to choose surgical training tended to be made early. Not having applied for specialty training was associated with being lower on agreeableness and conscientiousness. Conclusion: Medical school experiences are important in specialty choice but experiences post-graduation remain significant, particularly in some specialties (psychiatry in our sample). Career guidance is important at medical school and should be continued post-graduation, with senior clinicians supported in advising juniors. Careers advice in the first year post-graduation may be particularly important, especially for specialties which have difficulty recruiting or are poorly represented at medical school.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.IL-6 plays an important role in various inflammatory ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy. M\u00fcller cells are the major source of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, in the retina. However, the mechanism of regulating IL-6 production in these cells remains unclear. Examination of signaling pathways in human retinal M\u00fcller cells (MIO-M1 cell line) cultured with IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, IFN-\u03b3, glucose or mannitol showed that IL-1\u03b2 was the most potent stimulator of IL-6 production. In addition, IL-1 \u03b2 also increased NF-\u03baB p50 protein level and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and c-Jun. Induction of IL-6 production by IL-1\u03b2 was significantly reduced by addition of p38 MAPK (SB203580), MEK1/2 (U0126) or NF-\u03baB (BAY11-7082) inhibitors, with the highest effect being observed with SB203580. To explore the specific elements in IL-6 promoter responsible for IL-1\u03b2-induction of IL-6 expression, a series of plasmids bearing various IL-6 promoter mutations were transiently expressed in MIO-MI cells cultured in the presence or absence of IL-1\u03b2 (10. ng/ml) and/or SB203580 (10. \u03bcM). Results showed that IL-6 promoter activity of the parent pIL-6-Luc651 was significantly enhanced by IL-1\u03b2, but the level was significantly attenuated by SB203580. Furthermore, the IL-6 promoter activity was also reduced upon deletion of NF-\u03baB, AP-1 or C/EBP binding sites, with NF-\u03baB deletion being the greatest. These results are the first demonstration that IL-1\u03b2 induces IL-6 production in M\u00fcller cells by activation of IL-6 promoter activity predominantly through the p38 MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Despite promising preclinical results, few patients responded to treatment with recombinant TRAIL (Apo2L/Dulanermin) or TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies, such as conatumumab (AMG655). It is unknown whether this was due to intrinsic TRAIL resistance within primary human cancers or insufficient agonistic activity of the TRAIL-receptor (TRAIL-R)-targeting drugs. Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R)-mediated crosslinking increases the cancer-cell-killing activity of TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies in vivo. We tested this phenomenon using Fc\u03b3R-expressing immune cells from patients with ovarian cancer. However, even in the presence of high numbers of Fc\u03b3R-expressing immune cells, as found in ovarian cancer ascites, AMG655-induced apoptosis was not enabled to any significant degree, indicating that this concept may not translate into clinical use. On the basis of these results, we next set out to determine whether AMG655 possibly interferes with apoptosis induction by endogenous TRAIL, which could be expressed by immune cells. To do so, we tested how AMG655 affected apoptosis induction by recombinant TRAIL. This, however, resulted in the surprising discovery of a striking synergy between AMG655 and non-tagged TRAIL (Apo2L/TRAIL) in killing cancer cells. This combination was as effective in killing cancer cells as highly active recombinant isoleucine-zipper-tagged TRAIL (iz-TRAIL). The increased killing efficiency was due to enhanced formation of the TRAIL death-inducing signalling complex, enabled by concomitant binding of Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG655 to TRAIL-R2. The synergy of AMG655 with Apo2L/TRAIL extended to primary ovarian cancer cells and was further enhanced by combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or a second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic. Importantly, primary human hepatocytes were not killed by the AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL combination, also not when further combined with bortezomib or a SMAC mimetic. We therefore propose that clinical-grade non-tagged recombinant forms of TRAIL, such as dulanermin, could be combined with antibodies such as AMG655 to introduce a highly active TRAIL-R2-agonistic therapy into the cancer clinic.",

            "Abstract": "The synthesis and subsequent genomic integration of DNA that is complementary to the genomes of non-retroviral RNA viruses are rarely observed. However, upon infection of various human cell lines and primary fibroblasts with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we detected DNA complementary to the VSV RNA. The VSV DNA was detected in the cytoplasm as single-stranded DNA fully complementary to the viral mRNA from the poly(A) region to the 7-methyl guanosine cap. The formation of this DNA was cell-dependent. Experimentally, we found that the transduction of cells that do not produce VSV DNA with the long interspersed nuclear element 1 and their infection with VSV could lead to the formation of VSV DNA. Viral DNA complementary to other RNA viruses was also detected in the respective infected human cells. Thus, the genetic information of the non-retroviral RNA virus genome can flow into the DNA of mammalian cells expressing LINE-1-like elements.",

Both local and systemic disease may affect different anatomical regions of the eye. The least invasive routes for ocular drug administration are topical (e.g. eye drops) and systemic (e.g. tablets) formulations. Barriers that subserve as protection against pathogen entry also restrict drug permeation. Topically administered drugs often display limited bioavailability due to many physical and biochemical barriers including the pre-corneal tear film, the structure and biophysiological properties of the cornea, the limited volume that can be accommodated by the cul-de-sac, the lacrimal drainage system and reflex tearing. The tissue layers of the cornea and conjunctiva are further key factors that act to restrict drug delivery. Using carriers that enhance viscosity or bind to the ocular surface increases bioavailability. Matching the pH and polarity of drug molecules to the tissue layers allows greater penetration. Drug delivery to the posterior segment is a greater challenge and, currently, the standard route is via intravitreal injection, notwithstanding the risks of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment with frequent injections. Intraocular implants that allow sustained drug release are at different stages of development. Novel exciting therapeutic approaches include methods for promoting transscleral delivery, sustained release devices, nanotechnology and gene therapy.",

The deep optical detections from DES are used to extract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower VHS data. Joint seven-band (grizYJK) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg dedicated camera field centred at 02h26m-04d36m where the availability of ancillary multiwavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the data quality. Dual photometry increases the number of DES galaxies with measured VHS fluxes by a factor of ~4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matching and results in a ~1.5 mag increase in the 80 per cent completeness limit of the NIR data. Almost 70 per cent of DES sources have useful NIR flux measurements in this initial catalogue. Photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited by small number statistics, indicate that the VHS data can help reduce the photometric redshift scatter at both z < 0.5 and z > 1. We present example DES+VHS colour selection criteria for high-redshift luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at z ~ 0.7 as well as luminous quasars. Using spectroscopic observations in this field we show that the additional VHS fluxes enable a cleaner selection of both populations with <10 per cent contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and <0.5 per cent contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed LRGs. The combined DES+VHS data set, which will eventually cover almost 5000 sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited for target selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.",

Decision making is characterized by the parallel engagement of two distinct systems, goal-directed and habitual, thought to arise from two computational learning mechanisms, model-based and model-free. The habitual system is a candidate source of pathological fixedness. Using a decision task that measures the contribution to learning of either mechanism, we show a bias towards model-free (habit) acquisition in disorders involving both natural (binge eating) and artificial (methamphetamine) rewards, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This favoring of model-free learning may underlie the repetitive behaviors that ultimately dominate in these disorders. Further, we show that the habit formation bias is associated with lower gray matter volumes in caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that the dysfunction in a common neurocomputational mechanism may underlie diverse disorders involving compulsion.",

We sketch how the notion of morphological complexity, as defined by Trudgill (2011), applies to sign languages. Using these criteria, sign languages appear to be languages with low to moderate levels of morphological complexity. This may partly reflect the influence of key social characteristics of communities on the typological nature of languages. Although many deaf communities are relatively small and may involve dense social networks (both social characteristics that Trudgill claimed may lend themselves to morphological 'complexification'), the picture is complicated by the highly variable nature of the sign language acquisition for most deaf people, and the ongoing contact between native signers, hearing non-native signers, and those deaf individuals who only acquire sign languages in later childhood and early adulthood. These are all factors that may work against the emergence of morphological complexification. The relationship between linguistic typology and these key social factors may lead to a better understanding of the nature of sign language grammar. This perspective stands in contrast to other work where sign languages are sometimes presented as having complex morphology despite being young languages (e.g., Aronoffet al., 2005); in some descriptions, the social determinants of morphological complexity have not received much attention, nor has the notion of complexity itself been specifically explored.",

Fuel injection systems for DISI engines undergo rapid developments in their design and performance, therefore, their spray breakup mechanisms in the physical conditions encountered in DISI engines over a range of operating conditions and injection strategies require continuous attention. In this context, there are sparse data in the literature on spray formation differences between conventionally drilled injectors by spark erosion and latest Laser-drilled injector nozzles. A comparison was first carried out between the holes of spark-eroded and Laser-drilled injectors of same nominal type by analysing their in-nozzle geometry and surface roughness under an electron microscope. Then the differences in their spray characteristics under quiescent conditions, as well as in a motoring optical engine, are discussed on the basis of high-speed imaging experiments and image processing methods. Specifically, the spray development mechanism was quantified by spray tip penetration and cone angle data under a range of representative low-load and high-low engine operating conditions (0.5 bar and 1.0 bar absolute, respectively), as well as at low and high injector body temperatures (20 \u00b0C and 90\u00b0C) to represent cold and warm engine-head conditions. Droplet sizing was also performed with the two injectors using Phase Doppler Anemometry in a quiescent chamber.",

The injury to the rotator cuff tendons can be sustained in numerous ways and generally causes significant pain and disability to the affected individual. Following surgical repair of ruptured rotator cuff tendons re-rupture rates can be as high as 20-60%. In order to augment this repair process and to decrease the re-rupture rates tissue engineering methods can be used. These include the use of stem cells and growth factors. Mesenchymal stem cells are stem cells which can differentiate into a variety of connective tissue cell types and can therefore be utilised in repairing tendons. So far there has only been one human study using stem cells in rotator cuff tendon repair. This study has produced a positive result but consisted of only 14 patients and lacks a control group for comparison. Similar work has also been done using growth factors. Both individual and combination growth factor therapy have been used to improve rotator cuff tendon repair. However, the results so far have been disappointing with growth factors. For the purpose of future studies better techniques should be explored with regards to the delivery of stem cells and growth factors as well as the possibility of combining growth factor and stem cell therapy to improve repair rates.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The AuthorsThere is high variability in the response to antiepileptic treatment across people with epilepsy. Genetic factors significantly contribute to such variability. Recent advances in the genetics and neurobiology of the epilepsies are establishing the basis for a new era in the treatment of epilepsy, focused on each individual and their specific epilepsy. Variation in response to antiepileptic drug treatment may arise from genetic variation in a range of gene categories, including genes affecting drug pharmacokinetics, and drug pharmacodynamics, but also genes held to actually cause the epilepsy itself. From a purely pharmacogenetic perspective, there are few robust genetic findings with established evidence in epilepsy. Many findings are still controversial with anecdotal or less secure evidence and need further validation, e.g. variation in genes for transporter systems and antiepileptic drug targets. The increasing use of genetic sequencing and the results of large-scale collaborative projects may soon expand the established evidence. Precision medicine treatments represent a growing area of interest, focussing on reversing or circumventing the pathophysiological effects of specific gene mutations. This could lead to a dramatic improvement of the effectiveness and safety of epilepsy treatments, by targeting the biological mechanisms responsible for epilepsy in each specific individual. Whilst much has been written about epilepsy pharmacogenetics, there does now seem to be building momentum that promises to deliver results of use in clinic.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 1997 Taylor and Francis. All rights reserved.Marxism was not the only Western idea to influence the course of Russian history. In the early decades of this century, psychoanalysis was one of the most important components of Russian intellectual life. Freud himself, writing in 1912, said that \"in Russia, there seems to be a veritable epidemic of psychoanalysis.\" But until Alexander Etkind\u2019s Eros of the Impossible, the hidden history of Russian involvement in psychoanalysis has gone largely unnoticed and untold. The early twentieth century was a time when the craving of Russian intellectuals for world culture found a natural outlet in extended sojourns in the West, linking some of the most creative Russian personalities of the day with the best universities, salons, and clinics of Germany, Austria, France, and Switzerland. These ambassadors of the Russian intelligentsia were also Freud\u2019s patients, students, and collaborators. They exerted a powerful influence on the formative phase of psychoanalysis throughout Europe, and they carried their ideas back to a receptive Russian culture teeming with new ideas and full of hopes of self-transformation. Fascinated by the potential of psychoanalysis to remake the human personality in the socialist mold, Trotsky and a handful of other Russian leaders sponsored an early form of Soviet psychiatry. But, as the Revolution began to ossify into Stalinism, the early promise of a uniquely Russian approach to psychoanalysis was cut short. An early attempt to merge medicine and politics forms final chapters of Etkind\u2019s tale, the telling of which has been made possible by the undoing of the Soviet system. The effervescent Russian contribution to modern psychoanalysis has gone unrecognized too long, but Eros of the Impossible restores this fascinating story to its rightful place in history.",

Its prognostic value is unclear and may depend on the health outcome being examined. We examined the association of MHO phenotype with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes. Methods and results Body mass index and metabolic health, assessed using the Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) criteria, were assessed on 7122 participants (69.7% men) from the Whitehall II study, aged 39-63 years in 1991-93. Incident CVD (coronary heart disease or stroke) and type 2 diabetes were ascertained from medical screenings (every 5 years), hospital data, and registry linkage until 2009. A total of 657 individuals (9.2% of the cohort) were obese and 42.5% of these were classified as MHO in 1991-93. Over the median follow-up of 17.4 years, there were 828 incident cases of CVD and 798 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. Compared with metabolically healthy normal weight individuals, MHO subjects were at increased risk for CVD (HR \u2265 1.97, 95% CI: 1.38-2.80) and type 2 diabetes (3.25, 95% CI: 2.32-4.54). There was excess risk in metabolically unhealthy obese compared with MHO for type 2 diabetes (1.98, 95% CI: 1.39-2.83) but not CVD (1.23, 95% CI: 0.81-1.87). Treating all measures as time varying covariates produced similar findings. Conclusion For type 2 diabetes, the MHO phenotype is associated with lower risk than the metabolically unhealthy obese, but for CVD the risk is as elevated in both obesity phenotypes.",

All rights reserved.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic virus that can establish a persistent and chronic infection in humans through immune anergy. Currently, 3.5% of the global population is chronically infected with HBV, although the incidence of HBV infections is decreasing owing to vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the use of antiviral therapy to reduce the viral load of chronically infected individuals. The course of chronic HBV infection typically comprises different clinical phases, each of which potentially lasts for decades. Well-defined and verified serum and liver biopsy diagnostic markers enable the assessment of disease severity, viral replication status, patient risk stratification and treatment decisions. Current therapy includes antiviral agents that directly act on viral replication and immunomodulators, such as interferon therapy. Antiviral agents for HBV include reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which are nucleoside or nucleotide analogues that can profoundly suppress HBV replication but require long-term maintenance therapy. Novel compounds are being actively investigated to achieve the goal of HBV surface antigen seroclearance (functional cure), a serological state that is associated with a higher remission rate (thus, no viral rebound) after treatment cessation and a lower rate of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This Primer addresses several aspects of HBV infection, including epidemiology, immune pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention and management.",

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: Breakpoints of chromosomal abnormalities facilitate identification of novel candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide significant evidence supports the linkage between chromosome 17q25.3 and bipolar disorder (BD). Co-segregation of translocation t(9;17)(q33.2;q25.3) with psychiatric disorders has been reported. We aimed to narrow down these chromosomal breakpoint regions and to investigate the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms within these regions and BD as well as schizophrenia (SZ) in large genome-wide association study samples. Methods: We cross-linked Danish psychiatric and cytogenetic case registers to identify an individual with both t(9;17)(q33.2;q25.3) and BD. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was employed to map the chromosomal breakpoint regions of this proband. We accessed the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium BD (n = 16,731) and SZ (n = 21,856) data. Genetic associations between these disorders and single nucleotide polymorphisms within these breakpoint regions were analysed by BioQ, FORGE, and RegulomeDB programmes. Results: Four protein-coding genes [coding for (endonuclease V (ENDOV), neuronal pentraxin I (NPTX1), ring finger protein 213 (RNF213), and regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (RPTOR)] were found to be located within the 17q25.3 breakpoint region. NPTX1 was significantly associated with BD (p = 0.004), while ENDOV was significantly associated with SZ (p = 0.0075) after Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: Prior linkage evidence and our findings suggest NPTX1 as a novel candidate gene for BD.",

Although diffusion microscopic MRI (\u03bcMRI) has been used to phenotype embryos, widespread routine use is limited by extended scanning times, and there is no established experimental procedure ensuring optimal data acquisition. Methods: We developed two protocols for designing experimental procedures for diffusion \u03bcMRI of mouse embryos, which take into account the effect of embryo preparation and pulse sequence parameters on resulting data. We applied our protocols to an investigation of the splotch mouse model as an example implementation. Results: The protocols provide DTI data in 24 min per direction at 75 \u03bcm isotropic using a three-dimensional fast spin-echo sequence, enabling preliminary imaging in 3 h (6 directions plus one unweighted measurement), or detailed imaging in 9 h (42 directions plus six unweighted measurements). Application to the splotch model enabled assessment of spinal cord pathology. Conclusion: We present guidelines for designing diffusion \u03bcMRI experiments, which may be adapted for different studies and research facilities. As they are suitable for routine use and may be readily implemented, we hope they will be adopted by the phenotyping community.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2016.The polarized thermal emission from diffuse Galactic dust is the main foreground present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at frequencies above 100 GHz. In this paper we exploit the uniqueness of the Planck HFI polarization data from 100 to 353 GHz to measure the polarized dust angular power spectra C\u2113EE and C\u2113BB over the multipole range 40 < \u2113 < 600 well away from the Galactic plane. These measurements will bring new insights into interstellar dust physics and allow a precise determination of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. Despite the non-Gaussian and anisotropic nature of Galactic dust, we show that general statistical properties of the emission can be characterized accurately over large fractions of the sky using angular power spectra. The polarization power spectra of the dust are well described by power laws in multipole, C\u2113 \u221d \u2113\u03b1, with exponents \u03b1EE,BB = -2.42 \u00b1 0.02. The amplitudes of the polarization power spectra vary with the average brightness in a way similar to the intensity power spectra. The frequency dependence of the dust polarization spectra is consistent with modified blackbody emission with \u03b2d = 1.59 and Td = 19.6 K down to the lowest Planck HFI frequencies. We find a systematic difference between the amplitudes of the Galactic B- and E-modes, C\u2113BB/C\u2113EE = 0.5. We verify that these general properties are preserved towards high Galactic latitudes with low dust column densities. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no \"clean\" windows in the sky where primordial CMB B-mode polarization measurements could be made without subtraction of foreground emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the specific field recently targeted by the BICEP2 experiment. Extrapolation of the Planck 353 GHz data to 150 GHz gives a dust power D\u2113BB \u2261 \u2113(\u2113 +1)C\u2113BB/(2\u03c0) of 1.32 \u00d7 10-2 \u03bcKCMB2 over the multipole range of the primordial recombination bump (40 < \u2113 < 120); the statistical uncertainty is \u00b1 0.29 \u00d7 10-2 \u03bcKCMB2 and there is an additional uncertainty (+0.28, -0.24) \u00d7 10-2 \u03bcKCMB2 from the extrapolation. This level is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this \u2113 range, which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even in the cleanest windows of the sky.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).The sustained integrity of the mitochondrial population of a cell is critical for maintained cell health, and disruption of that integrity is linked strongly to human disease, especially to the neurodegenerative diseases. These are appalling diseases causing untold levels of suffering for which treatment is woefully inadequate. Understanding the mechanisms that disturb mitochondrial homeostasis may therefore prove key to identification of potential new therapeutic pathways. Mechanisms causing mitochondrial dysfunction include the acute catastrophic loss of function caused by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which collapses bioenergetic function and initiates cell death. This is best characterised in ischaemic reperfusion injury, although it may also contribute to a number of other diseases. More insidious disturbances of mitochondrial homeostasis may result from impaired balance in the pathways that promote mitochondrial repair (biogenesis) and pathways that remove dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy). Impaired coordination between these processes is emerging as a key feature of a number of neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders. Here we review pathways that may prove to be valuable potential therapeutic targets, focussing on the molecular mechanisms that govern the coordination of these processes and their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.",

This can be shown marginalizing the joint distribution of individual energies, which is a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. In the thermodynamic limit the beta distributions converge to gamma distributions with different arguments and shape or scale parameters, corresponding respectively to the Gaussian, i.e., Maxwell-Boltzmann, Maxwell, and Boltzmann or Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. These analytical results agree with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with different numbers of hard disks or spheres and hard reflecting walls or periodic boundary conditions. The agreement is perfect with our Monte Carlo algorithm, which acts only on velocities independently of positions with the collision versor sampled uniformly on a unit half sphere in d dimensions, while slight deviations appear with our molecular dynamics simulations for the smallest values of N.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Author.Prior studies indicate psychiatric symptoms such as depression, apathy and anxiety are risk factors for or prodromal symptoms of incipient Alzheimer's disease. The study of persons at 50% risk for inheriting autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations allows characterization of these symptoms before progressive decline in a population destined to develop illness. We sought to characterize early behavioural features in carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations. Two hundred and sixty-one persons unaware of their mutation status enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, a study of persons with or at-risk for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire, the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). Ninety-seven asymptomatic (CDR = 0), 25 mildly symptomatic (CDR = 0.5), and 33 overtly affected (CDR > 0.5) autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers were compared to 106 non-carriers with regard to frequency of behavioural symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire and severity of depressive symptoms on the Geriatric Depression Scale using generalized linear regression models with appropriate distributions and link functions. Results from the adjusted analyses indicated that depressive symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire were less common in cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers than in non-carriers (5% versus 17%, P = 0.014) and the odds of experiencing at least one behavioural sign in cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers was lower than in non-carriers (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.98, P = 0.042). Depression (56% versus 17%, P = 0.0003), apathy (40% versus 4%, P < 0.0001), disinhibition (16% versus 2%, P = 0.009), irritability (48% versus 9%, P = 0.0001), sleep changes (28% versus 7%, P = 0.003), and agitation (24% versus 6%, P = 0.008) were more common and the degree of self-rated depression more severe (mean Geriatric Depression Scale score of 2.8 versus 1.4, P = 0.006) in mildly symptomatic mutation carriers relative to non-carriers. Anxiety, appetite changes, delusions, and repetitive motor activity were additionally more common in overtly impaired mutation carriers. Similar to studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrated increased rates of depression, apathy, and other behavioural symptoms in the mildly symptomatic, prodromal phase of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease that increased with disease severity. We did not identify any increased psychopathology in mutation carriers over non-carriers during the presymptomatic stage, suggesting these symptoms result when a threshold of neurodegeneration is reached rather than as life-long qualities. Unexpectedly, we found lower rates of depressive symptoms in cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publisher Limited. All rights reserved.Spina bifida is a birth defect in which the vertebral column is open, often with spinal cord involvement. The most clinically significant subtype is myelomeningocele (open spina bifida), which is a condition characterized by failure of the lumbosacral spinal neural tube to close during embryonic development. The exposed neural tissue degenerates in utero, resulting in neurological deficit that varies with the level of the lesion. Occurring in approximately 1 per 1,000 births worldwide, myelomeningocele is one of the most common congenital malformations, but its cause is largely unknown. The genetic component is estimated at 60-70%, but few causative genes have been identified to date, despite much information from mouse models. Non-genetic maternal risk factors include reduced folate intake, anticonvulsant therapy, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Primary prevention by periconceptional supplementation with folic acid has been demonstrated in clinical trials, leading to food fortification programmes in many countries. Prenatal diagnosis is achieved by ultrasonography, enabling women to seek termination of pregnancy. Individuals who survive to birth have their lesions closed surgically, with subsequent management of associated defects, including the Chiari II brain malformation, hydrocephalus, and urological and orthopaedic sequelae. Fetal surgical repair of myelomeningocele has been associated with improved early neurological outcome compared with postnatal operation. Myelomeningocele affects quality of life during childhood, adolescence and adulthood, posing a challenge for individuals, families and society as a whole.

Positive cores were classified by cancer definitions: (1) any-cancer; (2) definition-1 [\u2265Gleason 4 + 3 or \u2265 6 mm cancer core length (CCL)] [high risk significant]; and (3) definition-2 (\u2265Gleason 3 + 4 or \u2265 4 mm CCL) cancer [intermediate\u2013high risk significant]. For each, logistic-regression mp-MRI models were derived from the training cohort and validated internally and with the temporal cohort. Sensitivity/specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve were calculated. LR model performance was compared to radiologists\u2019 performance.Results: Twenty-eight of 70 patients from the training cohort, and 25/85 patients from the temporal validation cohort had significant cancer on TPM. The ROC-AUC of the LR model for classification of cancer was 0.73/0.67 at internal/temporal validation. The radiologist A/B ROC-AUC was 0.65/0.74 (temporal cohort). For patients scored by radiologists as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (Pi-RADS) score 3, sensitivity/specificity of radiologist A \u2018best guess\u2019 and LR model was 0.14/0.54 and 0.71/0.61, respectively; and radiologist B \u2018best guess\u2019 and LR model was 0.40/0.34 and 0.50/0.76, respectively.Conclusions: LR models can improve classification of Pi-RADS score 3 lesions similar to experienced radiologists.Key Points: \u2022 MRI helps find prostate cancer in the anterior of the gland\u2022 Logistic regression models based on mp-MRI can classify prostate cancer\u2022 Computers can help confirm cancer in areas doctors are uncertain about",

Dystonia can be the manifesting neurological sign of many disorders, either in isolation (isolated dystonia) or with additional signs (combined dystonia). The main focus of this Primer is forms of isolated dystonia of idiopathic or genetic aetiology. These disorders differ in manifestations and severity but can affect all age groups and lead to substantial disability and impaired quality of life. The discovery of genes underlying the mendelian forms of isolated or combined dystonia has led to a better understanding of its pathophysiology. In some of the most common genetic dystonias, such as those caused by TOR1A, THAP1, GCH1 and KMT2B mutations, and idiopathic dystonia, these mechanisms include abnormalities in transcriptional regulation, striatal dopaminergic signalling and synaptic plasticity and a loss of inhibition at neuronal circuits. The diagnosis of dystonia is largely based on clinical signs, and the diagnosis and aetiological definition of this disorder remain a challenge. Effective symptomatic treatments with pharmacological therapy (anticholinergics), intramuscular botulinum toxin injection and deep brain stimulation are available; however, future research will hopefully lead to reliable biomarkers, better treatments and cure of this disorder.",

Simultaneous imaging of OH- and CH2O-PLIF was performed, and HR measurements obtained using the pixel-by-pixel multiplication of the OH- and CH2O-PLIF images. Blow-off was approached by slowly reducing the fuel flow rate. At conditions far from blow-off, HR occurred along the shear layer, whereas at conditions near blow-off, HR was also observed inside the recirculation zone (RZ). Localised extinctions along the flame front were seen at conditions away from blow-off, and increased in frequency and size as blow-off was approached. At conditions near blow-off, HR was detected on the boundary of flame pockets inside the RZ which had detached from the fragmented flame at the attachment point. Regions void of OH in the RZ near blow-off were often seen to be filled with CH2O. Regions void of both OH and CH2O were also observed, but less often, indicating the presence of both preheated gases and fresh reactants inside the RZ. Such images do not show a connection with the annular air jet, implying the cold reactants entered the RZ from the top. HR was observed to increase as a function of the absolute value of flame front curvature for the near unity Lewis number flames investigated. The measurements reported here are useful for model validation and for exploring the changes in turbulent premixed flame structure as extinction is approached.",

The association between CV responses to mental stress and reaction times (RTs) in aging individuals may be important but warrants further investigation. The present study assessed RTs to examine associations with CV responses to mental stress in healthy, older individuals using robust regression techniques. Participants were 262 men and women (mean age=63.3\u00b15.5 years) from the Whitehall II cohort who completed a RT task (Stroop) and underwent acute mental stress (mirror tracing) to elicit CV responses. Blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability were measured at baseline, during acute stress, and through a 75-min recovery. RT measures were generated from an ex-Gaussian distribution that yielded three predictors: mu-RT, sigma-RT, and tau-RT, the mean, standard deviation, and mean of the exponential component of the normal distribution, respectively. Decreased intraindividual RT variability was marginally associated with greater systolic (B=-.009, SE=.005, p=.09) and diastolic (B=-.004, SE=.002, p=.08) blood pressure reactivity. Decreased intraindividual RT variability was associated with impaired systolic blood pressure recovery (B=-.007, SE=.003, p=.03) and impaired vagal tone (B=-.0047, SE=.0024, p=.045). Study findings offer tentative support for an association between RTs and CV responses. Despite small effect sizes and associations not consistent across predictors, these data may point to a link between intrinsic neuronal plasticity and CV responses.",

P2X receptor subtypes are widely expressed in the CNS and their distributionis described in different regions. They function in synaptic cotransmission and neuromodulation, as well as in trophic signalling. ATP released from nerves and astroglial cells are predominantly involved in neuron-glial interactions. Purinergic signalling is involved in normal behaviour, including learning and memory, sleep and arousal, locomotor and feeding activities and cognition. P2X receptors participate in CNS pathophysiology, including injury, inflammation, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression and anxiety. P2X4 and P2X7 receptor antagonists are effective via microglia against neuropathic pain, while P2X3 receptor antagonists also reduce neuropathic pain, but via a differernt mechanism.",

This study aimed to describe the clinical indications, efficacy and adverse events (AEs) for the B-cell depleting agent, rituximab, in a large cohort of children with lupus.Methods: Prescribing records and the UK JSLE Cohort Study database identified rituximab use.Results: Sixty-three patients received 104 courses of intravenous rituximab over a 10-year period. Patients were aged 12.2 (IQR 9.0-13.9) years at diagnosis and 50 (79%) were female. They had disease for 1.4 (0.2-3.0) years at the time of rituximab. Lupus nephritis was the most common indication (36% of first courses). Clinical biomarkers, 2.5 (1.6-4.3) months after treatment, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ESR, C3, C4, creatinine, albumin, haemoglobin, anti-dsDNA titres and urine albumin:creatinine ratio. IgG, IgA and IgM levels decreased (p<0.01). Oral corticosteroid dose significantly reduced after rituximab (dose before 0.26 (0.09-0.44) mg/kg, after 0.17 (0.09-0.30) mg/kg; p=0.01)). AEs occurred in 19 (18%) of all courses including; delayed second dose (8%), Ig replacement (2%) and infusion reactions (6%; anaphylaxis 2%). The global BILAG score showed a trend toward improvement (before 4.5 (2.0-9.0), after 3.0 (2.0-5.0); p=0.16).Conclusion: Rituximab improves disease activity in children with lupus and serious AEs are infrequent. Controlled studies are required. Lupus (2015) 24, 10-17.",

Some of these disorders are believed to emerge during brain formation, at the time of interneuron specification, migration, and synapse formation. Here, using a mouse model and a host of histological and molecular biological techniques, we report that the signaling molecule cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and its activator p35, control the tangential migration of interneurons toward and within the cerebral cortex by modulating the critical neurodevelopmental signaling pathway, ErbB4/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, that has been repeatedly linked to schizophrenia. This finding identifies Cdk5 as a crucial signaling factor in cortical interneuron development in mammals.",

To what extent do taxes, transfers and the family attenuate these various factors in the evolution of life-cycle inequality? In this paper, we use rich Norwegian population panel data to answer these important questions. We let individuals with different education levels have a separate income process; and within each skill group, we allow for non-stationarity in age and time, heterogeneous experience profiles, and shocks of varying persistence. We find that the income processes differ systematically by age, skill level and their interaction. To accurately describe labor income dynamics over the life-cycle, it is necessary to allow for heterogeneity by education levels and account for non-stationarity in age and time. Our findings suggest that the redistributive nature of the Norwegian tax-transfer system plays a key role in attenuating the magnitude and persistence of income shocks, especially among the low skilled. By comparison, spouse's income matters less for the dynamics of inequality over the life-cycle.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016, The Author(s).In this work we present a new restart technique for iterative projection methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems admitting minmax characterization of their eigenvalues. Our technique makes use of the minmax induced local enumeration of the eigenvalues in the inner iteration. In contrast to global numbering which requires including all the previously computed eigenvectors in the search subspace, the proposed local numbering only requires a presence of one eigenvector in the search subspace. This effectively eliminates the search subspace growth and therewith the super-linear increase of the computational costs if a large number of eigenvalues or eigenvalues in the interior of the spectrum are to be computed. The new restart technique is integrated into nonlinear iterative projection methods like the Nonlinear Arnoldi and Jacobi-Davidson methods. The efficiency of our new restart framework is demonstrated on a range of nonlinear eigenvalue problems: quadratic, rational and exponential including an industrial real-life conservative gyroscopic eigenvalue problem modeling free vibrations of a rolling tire. We also present an extension of the method to problems without minmax property but with eigenvalues which have a dominant either real or imaginary part and test it on two quadratic eigenvalue problems.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Optical Society of America.Coherent receivers offer a potential solution for implementing a high-capacity, long-reach (up to 100 km) passive optical network (LR-PON), due mainly to their high sensitivity, frequency selectivity, and bandwidth efficiency. When using coherent receivers, received signals can be post-processed digitally to mitigate the specific impairments found in access networks and, additionally, relax the optical complexity requirements of the coherent receiver. However, the digital signal processing must itself be low complexity in order to minimize the overall complexity and power consumption of the optical network unit (ONU). This paper focuses on the impact of reduced complexity equalization algorithms on receiver sensitivity in a LR-PON. It is found that a cascade of linear filters can be combined into a single, truncated, linear, adaptive filter with negligible impact on receiver sensitivity. Additionally, by utilizing a multiplier-free tap weight update algorithm, the overall complexity of a digital coherent receiver can be significantly reduced, making it attractive for use in an ONU. Matched filtering, chromatic dispersion compensation, and polarization tracking are all performed by the adaptive equalizer. The performance of this low-complexity, multiplier-free equalizer is experimentally verified for 3 GBd polarization division multiplexed quadrature phase shift keying (12 Gbit/s) in both a back-to-back configuration and transmission over 100 km standard single-mode fiber.",

Many closed-form orientation estimation algorithms are based on traditional nonlinear filtering techniques, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). These approaches assume the uncertainties in the system state and measurements to be Gaussian-distributed. However, Gaussians cannot account for the periodic nature of the manifold of orientations and thus small angular errors have to be assumed and ad hoc fixes must be used. In this work, we develop computationally efficient recursive estimators that use the Bingham distribution. This distribution is defined on the hypersphere and is inherently more suitable for periodic problems. As a result, these algorithms are able to consistently estimate orientation even in the presence of large angular errors. Furthermore, handling of nontrivial system functions is performed using an entirely deterministic method which avoids any random sampling. A scheme reminiscent of the UKF is proposed for the nonlinear manifold of orientations. It is the first deterministic sampling scheme that truly reflects the nonlinear manifold of orientations.",

Our model suggests that decision makers draw on stereotypes about members of different social groups to infer the degree to which candidates possess the specific ability required for the task. Decision makers perceive candidates that have a greater ability required for the task as less (more) instrumental to their personal outcomes if they expect to compete (cooperate) with the candidate, and they discriminate in favor of candidates that are perceived as more instrumental to them. We tested our theory in the context of racial (Studies 1-3) and age (Study 4) discrimination in selection decisions with all-Male samples and found evidence consistent with our predictions. By explaining when and why decision makers discriminate in favor of, but also against, members of their own social group, this research may help to explain the mixed support for the dominant view that decision makers exhibit favoritism toward candidates that belong to the same social group. In addition, our research demonstrates the importance of considering the largely overlooked role of interdependent relationships within the organization in order to understand discrimination in organizations.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, International Association for Cryptologic Research.A non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof can be used to demonstrate the truth of a statement without revealing anything else. It has been shown under standard cryptographic assumptions that NIZK proofs of membership exist for all languages in NP. While there is evidence that such proofs cannot be much shorter than the corresponding membership witnesses, all known NIZK proofs for NP languages are considerably longer than the witnesses. Soon after Gentry\u2019s construction of fully homomorphic encryption, several groups independently contemplated the use of hybrid encryption to optimize the size of NIZK proofs and discussed this idea within the cryptographic community. This article formally explores this idea of using fully homomorphic hybrid encryption to optimize NIZK proofs and other related cryptographic primitives. We investigate the question of minimizing the communication overhead of NIZK proofs for NP and show that if fully homomorphic encryption exists then it is possible to get proofs that are roughly of the same size as the witnesses. Our technique consists in constructing a fully homomorphic hybrid encryption scheme with ciphertext size $$|m|+{\\mathrm {poly}}(k)$$|m|+poly(k), where $$m$$m is the plaintext and $$k$$k is the security parameter. Encrypting the witness for an NP-statement allows us to evaluate the NP-relation in a communication-efficient manner. We apply this technique to both standard non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and to universally composable non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. The technique can also be applied outside the realm of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, for instance to get witness-size interactive zero-knowledge proofs in the plain model without any setup or to minimize the communication in secure computation protocols.",

For generic rates \u03bd < \u22124 in the AC case, and for generic positive rates of convergence to the cones at the singular points in the CS case, the deformation theory is in general obstructed. We describe the obstruction spaces explicitly in terms of the spectrum of the Laplacian on the link of the cones on the ends, and compute the virtual dimension of the moduli space. We also present many applications of these results, including: the uniqueness of the Bryant\u2013Salamon AC G2 manifolds via local rigidity and the cohomogeneity one property of AC G2 manifolds asymptotic to homogeneous cones; the smoothness of the CS moduli space if the singularities are modeled on particular G2 cones; and the proof of existence of a \u201cgood gauge\u201d needed for desingularization of CS G2 manifolds.

One of the first questions patients with inflammatory bowel disease ask is if diet has anything to do with the cause or the treatment of the disease. There is increasing evidence that nutrition does have a major role to play; whether it has primary or an adjunctive role is not clear. Malnutrition is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in patients of all ages. It is much more marked in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Recent surveys show that up to 80% of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease have weight loss, and in children growth retardation may be the presenting complaint. Many patients have hypoalbuminemia, which some experts consider the most reliable index of disease activity.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Objective: Estimates of healthcare costs associated with HIV infection would provide valuable insight for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of possible prevention interventions. We evaluate the additional lifetime healthcare cost incurred due to living with HIV. Methods: We used a stochastic computer simulation model to project the distribution of lifetime outcomes and costs of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) infected with HIV in 2013 aged 30, over 10,000 simulations. We assumed a resource-rich setting with no loss to follow-up, and that standards and costs of healthcare management remain as now. Results: Based on a median (interquartile range) life expectancy of 71.5 (45.0-81.5) years for MSM in such a setting, the estimated mean lifetime cost of treating one person was \u00a3360,800 ($567,000 or \u20ac480,000). With 3.5% discounting, it was \u00a3185,200 ($291,000 or \u20ac246,000). The largest proportion (68%) of these costs was attributed to antiretroviral drugs. If patented drugs are replaced by generic versions (at 20% cost of patented prices), estimated mean lifetime costs reduced to \u00a3179,000 ($281,000 or \u20ac238,000) and \u00a3101,200 ($158,900 or \u20ac134,600) discounted. Conclusions: If 3,000 MSM had been infected in 2013, then future lifetime costs relating to HIV care is likely to be in excess of \u00a31 billion. It is imperative for investment into prevention programmes to be continued or scaled-up in settings with good access to HIV care services. Costs would be reduced considerably with use of generic antiretroviral drugs.",

We examined the association between MetS and disease activity, disease phenotype and corticosteroid exposure over time in patients with SLE. Methods Recently diagnosed (>15 months) patients with SLE from 30 centres across 11 countries were enrolled into the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Inception Cohort from 2000 onwards. Baseline and annual assessments recorded clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data. A longitudinal analysis of factors associated with MetS in the first 2 years of follow-up was performed using random effects logistic regression. Results We studied 1150 patients with a mean (SD) age of 34.9 (13.6) years and disease duration at enrolment of 24.2 (18.0) weeks. In those with complete data, MetS prevalence was 38.2% at enrolment, 34.8% at year 1 and 35.4% at year 2. In a multivariable random effects model that included data from all visits, prior MetS status, baseline renal disease, SLICC Damage Index <1, higher disease activity, increasing age and Hispanic or Black African race/ethnicity were independently associated with MetS over the first 2 years of follow-up in the cohort. Conclusions MetS is a persi stent phenotype in a significant proportion of patients with SLE. Renal lupus, active inflammatory disease and damage are SLE-related factors that drive MetS development while antimalarial agents appear to be protective from early in the disease course.",

Emergent awareness refers to a specific facet of motor unawareness in which anosognosic subjects recognise their motor deficits only when they have been requested to perform an action and they realise their errors. Four participants in the chronic phase after a stroke with anosognosia for hemiplegia were recruited. They took part in an \"error-full\" or \"analysis of error-based\" rehabilitative training programme. They were asked to attempt to execute specific actions, analyse their own strategies and errors and discuss the reasons for their failures. Pre- and post-training and follow-up assessments showed that motor unawareness improved in all four patients. These results indicate that unsuccessful action attempts with concomitant error analysis may facilitate the recovery of emergent awareness and, sometimes, of more general aspects of awareness.",

We examined multivariable associations between household income, social class, education, area deprivation for each SEP indicator (including a 5-point composite SEP score computed by aggregating individual SEP indicators) and each ST indicator using generalised linear models.Results: Accelerometry-measured total ST and occupational sitting/standing were positively associated with SEP score and most of its constituent SEP indicators, while television time was negatively associated with SEP score and education level. Arealevel deprivation was largely unrelated to ST. Those in the lowest composite SEP group spent 64 (95% CIs 52 to 76) and 72 (48 to 98), fewer minutes/day in total ST and occupational sitting/standing compared to those in the top SEP group, and an additional 48 (35-60) min/day watching television (p0.001 for linear trend). Stratified analyses showed that these associations between composite SEP score and total ST were evident only among participants who were in employment.Conclusions: Occupational sitting seems to drive the positive association between SEP and total ST. Lower SEP is linked to higher TV viewing times.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).We consider\u2014in a uniformly strictly convex potential regime\u2014two versions of random gradient models with disorder. In model (A) the interface feels a bulk term of random fields while in model (B) the disorder enters through the potential acting on the gradients. We assume a general distribution on the disorder with uniformly-bounded finite second moments. It is well known that for gradient models without disorder there are no Gibbs measures in infinite volume in dimension $$d = 2$$d=2, while there are shift-invariant gradient Gibbs measures describing an infinite-volume distribution for the gradients of the field, as was shown by Funaki and Spohn (Commun Math Phys 185:1\u201336, 1997). Van Enter and K\u00fclske proved in (Ann Appl Probab 18(1):109\u2013119, 2008) that adding a disorder term as in model (A) prohibits the existence of such gradient Gibbs measures for general interaction potentials in $$d = 2$$d=2. In Cotar and K\u00fclske (Ann Appl Probab 22(5):1650\u20131692, 2012) we proved the existence of shift-covariant random gradient Gibbs measures for model (A) when $$d\\ge 3$$d\u22653, the disorder is i.i.d and has mean zero, and for model (B) when $$d\\ge 1$$d\u22651 and the disorder has a stationary distribution. In the present paper, we prove existence and uniqueness of shift-covariant random gradient Gibbs measures with a given expected tilt$$u\\in {\\mathbb R}^{d}$$u\u2208Rd and with the corresponding annealed measure being ergodic: for model (A) when $$d\\ge 3$$d\u22653 and the disordered random fields are i.i.d. and symmetrically-distributed, and for model (B) when $$d\\ge 1$$d\u22651 and for any stationary disorder-dependence structure. We also compute for both models for any gradient Gibbs measure constructed as in Cotar and K\u00fclske (Ann Appl Probab 22(5):1650\u20131692, 2012), when the disorder is i.i.d. and its distribution satisfies a Poincar\u00e9 inequality assumption, the optimal decay of covariances with respect to the averaged-over-the-disorder gradient Gibbs measure.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014.Surface slip distributions for an active normal fault in central Italy have been measured using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), in order to assess the impact of changes in fault orientation and kinematics when modelling subsurface slip distributions that control seismic moment release. The southeastern segment of the surface trace of the Campo Felice active normal fault near the city of L'Aquila was mapped and surveyed using techniques from structural geology and using TLS to define the vertical and horizontal offsets of geomorphic slopes since the last glacial maximum (15. \u00b1. 3. ka). The fault geometry and kinematics measured from 43 sites and throw/heave measurements from geomorphic offsets seen on 250 scarp profiles were analysed using a modification of the Kostrov equations to calculate the magnitudes and directions of horizontal principal strain-rates. The map trace of the studied fault is linear, except where a prominent bend has formed to link across a former left-stepping relay-zone. The dip of the fault and slip direction are constant across the bend. Throw-rates since 15. \u00b1. 3. ka decrease linearly from the fault centre to the tip, except in the location of the prominent bend where higher throw rates are recorded. Vertical coseismic offsets for two palaeo earthquake ruptures seen as fresh strips of rock at the base of the bedrock scarp also increase within the prominent bend. The principal strain-rate, calculated by combining strike, dip, slip-direction and post 15. \u00b1. 3. ka throw rate, decreases linearly from the fault centre towards the tip; the strain-rate does not increase across the prominent fault bend. The above shows that changes in fault strike, whilst having no effect on the principal horizontal strain-rate, can produce local maxima in throw-rates during single earthquakes that persist over the timescale of multiple earthquakes (15. \u00b1. 3. ka). Detailed geomorphological and structural characterisation of active faults is therefore a critical requirement in order to properly define fault activity for the purpose of accurate seismic hazard assessment. We discuss the implications of modelling subsurface slip distributions for earthquake ruptures through inversion of GPS, InSAR and strong motion data using planar fault approximations, referring to recent examples on the nearby Paganica fault that ruptured in the Mw 6.3 2009.

            "Abstract": "Mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with a wide spectrum of disorders encompassing the myopathies, encephalopathies and cardiomyopathies, in addition to organ specific presentations such as diabetes mellitus and deafness. The pathogenesis of mtDNA mutations is not fully understood although it is assumed that their final common pathway involves impaired oxidative phosphorylation. The identification of a specific respiratory chain defect (complex I deficiency) in Parkinson's disease (PD) 10 years ago focused attention on the aetiological and pathogenetic roles that mitochondria may play in neurodegenerative diseases. There is evidence now emerging that mtDNA abnormalities may determine the complex I defect in a proportion of PD patients and it may prove possible to use biochemical analysis of platelet and cybrid complex I function to identify those that lie within this group. Respiratory chain defects of a different pattern have been identified in Huntington's disease (HD) (complex II/III deficiency) and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) complex I-III deficiency). In both these disorders, the mitochondrial abnormality is secondary to the primary nuclear mutation:CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene in HD, and GAA repeat in the frataxin gene in FA. Nevertheless, it appears that the mitochondrion may be the target of the biochemical defects that are the consequence of these mutations. There is a close and reciprocal relationship between respiratory chain dysfunction and free radical generation, and there is evidence for oxidative stress and damage in PD, HD and FA, which together with the mitochondrial defect may result in cell damage. Impaired oxidative phosphorylation and free radical generation may independently adversely affect the maintenance of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)). A fall in \u0394\u03c8(m) is an early event (preceding nuclear fragmentation) in the apoptotic pathway. It is possible therefore that mitochondrial dysfunction in the neurodegenerative disorders may result in a fall in the apoptotic threshold of neurones which, in some, may be sufficient to induce cell death whilst, in others, additional factors may be required. In any event, mitochondria present an important target for future strategies for 'neuroprotection' to prevent or retard neurodegeneration. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The management of these injuries is challenging and often requires prolonged and potentially painful treatment. The Ilizarov technique of bone transport using circular external fixators is widely used for limb reconstruction of large bone defects. Other techniques include vascularised fibular grafting, the use of induced pseudosynovial membranes combined with cancellous autologous bone grafts and the use of autologous, allogeneic or synthetic bone grafts on their own for smaller defects. Future directions include further research on bone tissue engineering using stem cell therapy and growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The purpose of this Continuing Medical Education article is to describe the key limb reconstructive techniques that may be employed to treat traumatic bone loss. In particular, this article is intended to serve as a revision tool for those preparing for postgraduate examinations.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.This letter addresses the problem of filtering with a state-space model.Standard approaches for filtering assume that a probabilistic model for observations (i.e., the observation model) is given explicitly or at least parametrically. We consider a setting where this assumption is not satisfied; we assume that the knowledge of the observationmodel is provided only by examples of state-observation pairs. This setting is important and appears when state variables are defined as quantities that are very different from the observations. We propose kernel Monte Carlo filter, a novel filtering method that is focused on this setting. Our approach is based on the framework of kernel mean embeddings, which enables nonparametric posterior inference using the state-observation examples. The proposed method represents state distributions as weighted samples, propagates these samples by sampling, estimates the state posteriors by kernel Bayes' rule, and resamples by kernel herding. In particular, the sampling and resampling procedures are novel in being expressed using kernel mean embeddings, so we theoretically analyze their behaviors.We reveal the following properties, which are similar to those of corresponding procedures in particle methods: the performance of sampling can degrade if the effective sample size of a weighted sample is small, and resampling improves the sampling performance by increasing the effective sample size. We first demonstrate these theoretical findings by synthetic experiments. Then we show the effectiveness of the proposed filter by artificial and real data experiments, which include vision-based mobile robot localization.",

Tissue diagnosis was obtained whenever possible. The cumulative incidence of proven/probable IFD among the 202 evaluable cases after 2 years follow-up was 21%, including 14 proven and 30 probable IFDs. Using either GM or BDG as the sole biomarker (plus host and clinical evidence) the apparent overall incidence of proven/probable IFD was 11% and 16%, respectively. Combined GM/BDG detected all biopsy-proven mould IFD. Baseline CT abnormalities were found in 76/202 (38%) patients. Baseline CT abnormalities and Karnofsky score <90, monocytopenia >10 d and bacteraemia were independent risk factors associated with greater than twofold increased IFD risk.

All rights reserved.Purpose of reviewSince the last review of Williams syndrome in Current Opinion (2001) there have been many advances in knowledge about the cognitive, social and psychological impairments that characterize the disorder. The present review focuses on current research in these areas.Recent findingsWilliams syndrome is associated with a wide range of cognitive, linguistic, social and other difficulties. When young, these deficits may appear relatively mild-for example, many children are highly sociable and talkative-but with age the impact of these difficulties becomes more evident. Thus, inappropriate social behaviours can significantly increase the risk of social exclusion and vulnerability to abuse. Their superficially good speech can lead to educational and other services failing to understand the true extent of impairments or the need for specialist support. Mental health problems, especially related to anxiety, often become an increasing challenge from adolescence onwards.SummaryThe core difficulties associated with Williams syndrome have a cascading effect on many areas of development over time. However, specialist provision is rare and intervention trials are almost nonexistent. Longitudinal research is needed to identify factors associated with cognitive, social and emotional problems and to develop more effective ways of minimizing and treating difficulties.",

Determining the status of these data-deficient (DD) species is essential to developing an accurate picture of global biodiversity and identifying potentially threatened DD species. To address this knowledge gap, we used predictive models incorporating species' life history, geography, and threat information to predict the conservation status of DD terrestrial mammals. We constructed the models with 7 machine learning (ML) tools trained on species of known status. The resultant models showed very high species classification accuracy (up to 92%) and ability to correctly identify centers of threatened species richness. Applying the best model to DD species, we predicted 313 of 493 DD species (64%) to be at risk of extinction, which increases the estimated proportion of threatened terrestrial mammals from 22% to 27%. Regions predicted to contain large numbers of threatened DD species are already conservation priorities, but species in these areas show considerably higher levels of risk than previously recognized. We conclude that unless directly targeted for monitoring, species classified as DD are likely to go extinct without notice. Taking into account information on DD species may therefore help alleviate data gaps in biodiversity indicators and conserve poorly known biodiversity.",

Single-stage revision is a potential alternative to the standard two-stage procedure because it involves only one surgical procedure, so if it is comparably effective, it would be associated with less patient morbidity and lower cost.Questions/purposes: We compared (1) the degree to which our protocol of a highly selective single-stage revision approach achieved infection control compared with a two-stage revision approach to TKA infections; and (2) Knee Society scores and radiographic evidence of implant fixation between the single-stage and two-stage patients who were treated for more complicated infections.Methods: Between 2004 and 2009, we treated 102 patients for chronic TKA infections, of whom 28 (27%) were treated using a single-stage approach and 74 (73%) were treated using a two-stage approach. All patients were available for followup at a minimum of 3 years (mean, 6.5 years; range, 3\u20139 years). The indications for using a single-stage approach were minimal/moderate bone loss, the absence of immunocompromise, healthy soft tissues, and a known organism with known sensitivities for which appropriate antibiotics are available. Participants included 38 men and 64 women with a mean age of 65 years (range, 45\u201387 years). We used the Musculoskeletal Infection Society definition of periprosthetic joint infection to confirm infection control at the last followup appointment. Radiographs were evaluated for signs of loosening, and patients completed Knee Society Scores for clinical evaluation.Results: None of the patients in the single-stage revision group developed recurrence of infection, and five patients (93%) in the two-stage revision group developed reinfection (p = 0.16). Patients treated with a single-stage approach had higher Knee Society scores than did patients treated with the two-stage approach (88 versus 76, p < 0.001). However, radiographic findings showed a well-fixed prosthesis in all patients with no evidence of loosening at last followup in either group.Conclusions: Our data provide preliminary support to the use of a single-stage approach in highly selected patients with chronically infected TKAs as an alternative to a two-stage procedure. However, larger, multicenter, prospective trials are called for to validate our findings.Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic study.

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb-1, were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Events with a single isolated electron or muon, and four or more jets, at least one of which is likely to have originated from hadronization of a bottom quark, are selected. A template technique is used to measure the asymmetry in the distribution of differences in the top quark and antiquark absolute rapidities. The measured asymmetry is Acy=[0.33\u00b10.26(stat)\u00b10.33(syst)]%, which is the most precise result to date.

            "Abstract": "The focus of much scientific and medical research is directed towards understanding the disease process and defining therapeutic intervention strategies. The scientific basis of drug safety is very complex and currently remains poorly understood, despite the fact that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major health concern and a serious impediment to development of new medicines. Toxicity issues account for \u223c21% drug attrition during drug development and safety testing strategies require considerable animal use. Mechanistic relationships between drug plasma levels and molecular/cellular events that culminate in whole organ toxicity underpins development of novel safety assessment strategies. Current in vitro test systems are poorly predictive of toxicity of chemicals entering the systemic circulation, particularly to the liver. Such systems fall short because of (1) the physiological gap between cells currently used and human hepatocytes existing in their native state, (2) the lack of physiological integration with other cells/systems within organs, required to amplify the initial toxicological lesion into overt toxicity, (3) the inability to assess how low level cell damage induced by chemicals may develop into overt organ toxicity in a minority of patients, (4) lack of consideration of systemic effects. Reproduction of centrilobular and periportal hepatocyte phenotypes in in vitro culture is crucial for sensitive detection of cellular stress. Hepatocyte metabolism/phenotype is dependent on cell position along the liver lobule, with corresponding differences in exposure to substrate, oxygen and hormone gradients. Application of bioartificial liver (BAL) technology can encompass in vitro predictive toxicity testing with enhanced sensitivity and improved mechanistic understanding. Combining this technology with mechanistic mathematical models describing intracellular metabolism, fluid-flow, substrate, hormone and nutrient distribution provides the opportunity to design the BAL specifically to mimic the in vivo scenario. Such mathematical models enable theoretical hypothesis testing, will inform the design of in vitro experiments, and will enable both refinement and reduction of in vivo animal trials. In this way, development of novel mathematical modelling tools will help to focus and direct in vitro and in vivo research, and can be used as a framework for other areas of drug safety science. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

We have successfully piloted functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a neuroimaging tool in rural Gambia. Four-to-eight month old infants watched videos of Gambian adults perform social movements, while haemodynamic responses were recorded using fNIRS. We found distinct regions of the posterior superior temporal and inferior frontal cortex that evidenced either visual-social activation or vocally selective activation (vocal > non-vocal). The patterns of selective cortical activation in Gambian infants replicated those observed within similar aged infants in the UK. These are the first reported data on the measurement of localized functional brain activity in young infants in Africa and demonstrate the potential that fNIRS offers for field-based neuroimaging research of cognitive function in resource-poor rural communities.",

Bernard Knapp and Peter van Dommelen 2014.Two significant recent developments concerning the archaeology of Iron Age central Italy call for a fresh analysis of settlement dynamics in the region and their relations vis-\u00e0-vis one another. The first development is the reconsideration of ancient urban centres as single entities, and the need, which has mostly been advocated for the Classical and later historical Mediterranean, to examine the systems or networks within which these centres functioned. The second development is the increasing amount of fieldwork-based research in those regions that have been situated at the margins of scholarly interest. New data from such research increasingly allow us to see the networks or systems that linked these regions to better-known ones on the Tyrrhenian coast. Such developments enable us to reassess the importance traditionally given to the core urban area of central Italy, and to offer a more balanced framework for understanding the exchange dynamics among Iron Age Central Italian communities. This chapter intends to do precisely that, and in so doing, its aim is twofold: first, to decentralise central Italy in line with studies on other Mediterranean regions that have similarly dispelled distinctions between core urban areas and non-urban peripheries; second, to shift attention away from evolutionary and other categories towards a perspective that stresses connectivity and patterns of human mobility.",

We prove almost matching upper and lower bounds for the minimum size of the set of lines in general position that always contains n in convex position.

As one of the major sources of skeletal progenitor cells, the periosteum plays a crucial role not only in bone development and growth, but also during bone fracture healing. Aided by the continuous expansion of tools and techniques, we are now starting to acquire more insight into the specific role and regulation of periosteal cells. From a therapeutic point of view, the periosteum has attracted much attention as a cell source for bone tissue engineering purposes. This interest derives not only from the physiological role of the periosteum during bone repair, but is also supported by the unique properties and marked bone-forming potential of expanded periosteum-derived cells. We provide an overview of the current knowledge of periosteal cell biology, focusing on the cellular composition and molecular regulation of this remarkable tissue, as well as the application of periosteum-derived cells in regenerative medicine approaches.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Standard myeloablative conditioning regimens for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are based on total body irradiation (TBI). However, TBI causes profound short-term and long-term side effects, provoking the necessity for alternative regimens. Treosulfan combines a potent immunosuppressive and antileukaemic effect with myeloablative activity and low toxicity profile. We retrospectively studied toxicity and outcome of 71 paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following treosulfan-based conditioning aiming to identify risk factors for treatment failure and dose-depending outcome differences. Early regimen-related toxicity was low. No case of veno-occlusive disease was reported. There was no association of toxicity with age or number of HSCT. Event-free survival (EFS) of infants was significantly better compared to older children. Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 51 % and not significantly influenced by number of HSCT (first HSCT 54 %, \u2265second HSCT 44 %, p = 0.71). In multivariate analysis, OS and EFS were significantly worse for patients transplanted without complete remission (p = 0.04 and 0.004). Treatment-related mortality was low at 14 %. We conclude that treosulfan-based conditioning is a safe and efficacious approach for paediatric ALL.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.We address the problem of separating stars from galaxies in future large photometric surveys. We focus our analysis on simulations of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). In the first part of the paper, we derive the science requirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmological parameters with the gravitational weak lensing and large-scale structure probes. These requirements are dictated by the need to control both the statistical and systematic errors on the cosmological parameters, and by point spread function calibration. We formulate the requirements in terms of the completeness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. In order to achieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method for star/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. We first use principal component analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parameters and extract from it the most relevant information. We then use the reduced set of parameters as input to an Artificial Neural Network. This multiparameter approach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifier implemented in SExtractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases the purity by up to 20 per cent for stars and by up to 12 per cent for galaxies, at i-magnitude fainter than 23.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd.Background Glycaemic control is a key issue in the care of people with diabetes mellitus (DM). Periodontal disease is the inflammation and destruction of the underlying supporting tissues of the teeth. Some studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between glycaemic control and periodontal disease. This review updates the previous version published in 2010. Objectives The objective is to investigate the effect of periodontal therapy on glycaemic control in people with diabetes mellitus. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane OralHealth Group Trials Register (to 31 December 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 31 December 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 31 December 2014), LILACS via BIREME (1982 to 31 December 2014), and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 31 December 2014). ZETOC (1993 to 31 December 2014) and Web of Knowledge (1990 to 31 December 2014) were searched for conference proceedings. Additionally, two periodontology journals were handsearched for completeness, Annals of Periodontology (1996 to 2003) and Periodontology 2000 (1993 to 2003). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with type 1 or type 2 DM (T1DM/T2DM) with a diagnosis of periodontitis. Interventions included periodontal treatments such as mechanical debridement, surgical treatment and antimicrobial therapy. Two broad comparisons were proposed: 1. periodontal therapy versus no active intervention/usual care; 2. periodontal therapy versus alternative periodontal therapy. Data collection and analysis For this review update, at least two review authors independently examined the titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, selected the included trials, extracted data from included trials and assessed included trials for risk of bias. Our primary outcome was blood glucose levels measured as glycated (glycosylated) haemoglobin assay (HbA1c). Our secondary outcomes included adverse effects, periodontal indices (bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) and probing pocket depth (PPD)), cost implications and diabetic complications. Main results We included 35 studies (including seven from the previous version of the review), which included 2565 participants in total. All studies used a parallel RCT design, and 33 studies (94%) only targeted T2DM patients. There was variation between studies with regards to included age groups (ages 18 to 80), duration of follow-up (3 to 12 months), use of antidiabetic therapy, and included participants' baseline HbA1c levels (from 5.5% to 13.1%). We assessed 29 studies (83%) as being at high risk of bias, two studies (6%) as being at low risk of bias, and four studies (11%) as unclear. Thirty-four of the studies provided data suitable for analysis under one or both of the two comparisons. Comparison 1: low quality evidence from 14 studies (1499 participants) comparing periodontal therapy with no active intervention/ usual care demonstrated that mean HbA1c was 0.29% lower (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48% to 0.10% lower) 3 to 4 months post-treatment, and 0.02% lower after 6 months (five studies, 826 participants; 95% CI 0.20% lower to 0.16% higher). Comparison 2: 21 studies (920 participants) compared different periodontal therapies with each other. There was only very low quality evidence for themultiple head-to-head comparisons, themajority of which were unsuitable to be pooled, and provided no clear evidence of a benefit for one periodontal intervention over another. We were able to pool the specific comparison between scaling and root planing (SRP) plus antimicrobial versus SRP and there was no consistent evidence that the addition of antimicrobials to SRP was of any benefit to delivering SRP alone (mean HbA1c 0.00% lower: 12 studies, 450 participants; 95% CI 0.22% lower to 0.22% higher) at 3-4 months post-treatment, or after 6 months (meanHbA1c 0.04%lower: five studies, 206 patients; 95%CI 0.41% lower to 0.32% higher). Less than half of the studies measured adverse effects. The evidence was insufficient to conclude whether any of the treatments were associated with harm. No other patient-reported outcomes (e.g. quality of life) were measured by the included studies, and neither were cost implications or diabetic complications. Studies showed varying degrees of success with regards to achieving periodontal health, with some showing high levels of residual inflammation following treatment. Statistically significant improvements were shown for all periodontal indices (BOP, CAL, GI, PI and PPD) at 3-4 and 6 months in comparison 1; however, this was less clear for individual comparisons within the broad category of comparison 2. Authors' conclusions There is low quality evidence that the treatment of periodontal disease by SRP does improve glycaemic control in people with diabetes, with a mean percentage reduction in HbA1c of 0.29% at 3-4 months; however, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that this is maintained after 4 months. There was no evidence to support that one periodontal therapy was more effective than another in improving glycaemic control in people with diabetes mellitus. In clinical practice, ongoing professional periodontal treatment will be required to maintain clinical improvements beyond 6 months. Further research is required to determine whether adjunctive drug therapies should be used with periodontal treatment. Future RCTs should evaluate this, provide longer follow-up periods, and consider the inclusion of a third 'no treatment' control arm. Larger, well conducted and clearly reported studies are needed in order to understand the potential of periodontal treatment to improve glycaemic control among people with diabetes mellitus. In addition, it will be important in future studies that the intervention is effective in reducing periodontal inflammation and maintaining it at lowered levels throughout the period of observation.",

Rapidly progressive dementia and ataxia are the common themes in the clinical presentation, but these can be accompanied by a wide variety of neurological or psychiatric syndromes. Neuropathological examination of brain tissue remains the only way of making a definite diagnosis, but major advances in magnetic resonance brain imaging, such as diffusion-weighted sequences, and cerebrospinal fluid prion amplification assays have proved to be reliable ante mortem diagnostic tools. Prion protein gene (PRNP) analysis is also recommended, to rule out Mendelian forms and provide the codon 129 genotype, which has profound effects on incubation period, susceptibility, duration of illness, clinical phenotype and neuropathology. At present, there is no effective treatment for prion disease.",

This was the aim of the present study. Methods and results Initiated in 1967/70, the original Whitehall study is an on-going cohort study of 15,402 male UK government workers free of coronary heart disease when they took part in a baseline medical examination during which a range of standard risk factors was measured. In analyses in which we stratified by duration of follow-up, there was evidence of time-dependency for most risk factor-disease relationships. Thus, the associations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and cigarette smoking with coronary heart disease and stroke diminished in strength with increasing duration of follow-up, whereas the magnitude of the body mass index-coronary heart disease relation was unchanged. For example, the age-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for cigarette smoking (versus never smoked) in relation to coronary heart disease were: 2.49 (1.80, 3.44), 1.65 (1.34, 2.03), 1.36 (1.15, 1.61) and 1.32 (1.10, 1.58) for follow-up periods 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30+ years, respectively. Conclusion Despite a general diminution in the strength of effect over time, even in the fourth decade of follow-up, classic risk factors retained some predictive capacity for coronary heart disease and, to a lesser degree, stroke.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.The global public spaces literature has been critical of contemporary manifestations of public space on a number of grounds. This article reports on a research project that attempted to gauge the validity of these critiques through an examination of new and regenerated public spaces in London. The article introduces the dominant critiques around public space before outlining the mixed-methods approach used to interrogate them. The key findings from this work are summarised before the nature of contemporary public space is re-theorised in a more avowedly positive and pragmatic manner than is often the case, one that celebrates a return of a public spaces paradigm through tentatively advancing a new narrative and set of normative principles for public space generation. The work concludes that a more balanced view of public space is required, one that recognises the multiple complex types, roles and audiences for public spaces in cities today.",

We investigated the relevance of the lectin complement pathway in CVID patients by analysing ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 serum levels and genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FCN2 and FCN3 genes. Our results show that ficolin-2 levels in CVID patients are significantly lower (P<0\u00b70001) than in controls. The lowest ficolin-2 levels are found in CVID patients with bronchiectasis (P=0\u00b70004) and autoimmunity (P=0\u00b704). Although serum levels of ficolin-3 were similar in CVID patients and controls, CVID patients with bronchiectasis again showed lower levels when compared to controls (P=0\u00b70001). Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the FCN2 gene confirmed known influences on ficolin-2 serum levels, but did not support a genetic basis for the observed ficolin-2 deficiency in CVID. We found that CVID patients with bronchiectasis have very low levels of ficolin-2. The reason for the deficiency of ficolin-2 in CVID and any possible causal relationship is currently unknown. However, as bronchiectasis is a very important factor for morbidity and mortality in CVID, ficolin-2 could also serve as biomarker for monitoring disease complications such as bronchiectasis.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: To investigate whether the introduction of non-invasive pre-natal testing for Down's syndrome (DS) has the potential to undermine informed choice. Participants: Three hundred and ninety-three health professionals; 523 pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire study across nine maternity units and three conferences in the UK designed to assess opinions regarding test delivery and how information should be communicated to women when offered Down's syndrome screening (DSS) or diagnosis using invasive (IDT) or non-invasive testing (NIPT). Results: Both pregnant women and health professionals in the NIPT and DSS groups were less likely than the IDT group to consider that testing should take place at a return visit or that obtaining written consent was necessary, and more likely to think testing should be carried out routinely. Compared to health professionals, pregnant women expressed a stronger preference for testing to occur on the same day as pre-test counselling (P=0.000) and for invasive testing to be offered routinely (P=0.000). They were also more likely to indicate written consent as necessary for DSS (P=0.000) and NIPT (P<0.05). Conclusions: Health professionals and pregnant women view the consenting process differently across antenatal test types. These differences suggest that informed choice may be undermined with the introduction of NIPT for DS into clinical practice. To maintain high standards of care, effective professional training programmes and practice guidelines are needed which prioritize informed consent and take into account the views and needs of service users.",

Everyday material and discursive circulations make up these assemblages, serving as conduits of affect that produce an emergent agency. To demonstrate this claim, I outline a genealogy of the UKUSA alliance, an assemblage of intelligence communities in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. I then trace the circulation of materialities and affects\u2014at the scales of individual subjects, technological systems of mediation, and transnational processes of foreign policy formation. In doing so, I offer a bottom-up process of assemblage that produces the emergent phenomena that proponents of civilizational thinking mistakenly attribute to macroscaled factors, such as culture.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.Background and objectives: Screening for Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, reveals a significant number of individuals with a genetic variant of unknown significance without classical FD manifestations; these variants in the \u03b1-galactosidase A gene often result in a high residual leukocyte \u03b1-galactosidase A and it is unclear whether these individuals suffer from FD. Therefore, a structured diagnostic approach is warranted. We present a diagnostic algorithm on how to approach adults with chronic kidney disease and an uncertain diagnosis of FD nephropathy. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: A modified Delphi procedure was conducted to reach consensus among 11 FD experts. A systematic review was performed to identify possible criteria that could confirm or exclude FD nephropathy. Results: The gold standard for FD nephropathy was defined as characteristic storage on electron microscopy (EM) in a kidney biopsy in the absence of medication that may induce similar storage. The suggested criteria to confirm FD nephropathy are as follows: 'renal cysts', 'Maltese cross sign', 'immunohistochemical staining of Gb3 in urine' and 'high urinary Gb3'; and to exclude FD nephropathy: 'absence of renal cysts', 'small kidneys' and 'high protein excretion' were rejected because of low or uncertain specificity. Urinary Gb3 may be increased in other kidney diseases and there was no agreement on this criterion, although a third of the panel indicated that it is sufficient to diagnose FD nephropathy. The 'Maltese cross sign' and 'high urinary Gb3' were selected as red flags to suggest the possibility of FD nephropathy, but are not sufficient for a definite diagnosis of FD nephropathy. Conclusions: In adults with chronic kidney disease, an \u03b1-galactosidase A gene variant and an uncertain diagnosis of FD, a kidney biopsy with EM analysis should be performed to confirm or reject the diagnosis of FD nephropathy. Other criteria currently cannot substitute for a biopsy in these cases.",

All rights reserved.In humans and other primates, the analysis of visual motion includes populations of neurons in the middle-temporal (MT) area of visual cortex. Motion analysis will be constrained by the structure of neural correlations in these populations. Here, we use multi-electrode arrays to measure correlations in anesthetized marmoset, a New World monkey where area MT lies exposed on the cortical surface. We measured correlations in the spike count between pairs of neurons and within populations of neurons, for moving dot fields and moving gratings. Correlations were weaker in area MT than in area V1. The magnitude of correlations in area MT diminished with distance between receptive fields, and difference in preferred direction. Correlations during presentation of moving gratings were stronger than those during presentation of moving dot fields, extended further across cortex, and were less dependent on the functional properties of neurons. Analysis of the timescales of correlation suggests presence of 2 mechanisms. A local mechanism, associated with near-synchronous spiking activity, is strongest in nearby neurons with similar direction preference and is independent of visual stimulus. A global mechanism, operating over larger spatial scales and longer timescales, is independent of direction preference and is modulated by the type of visual stimulus presented.",

In its simplest form, bone tissue engineering (BTE) combines cells and scaffolds in vitro to replace damaged or lost bone in vivo. Our aim was to develop BTE porous TiAl6V4 constructs with a calcium-phosphate coating without or with mesenchy-mal stem cells (MSCs) seeded throughout the entire porous structure to enhance new bone formation and which could be used for rTHRs. Porous titanium scaffolds made by selective laser sintering were seeded throughout with autologous bone marrow MSCs and cultured in a perfusion bioreactor. Constructs were implanted in the medial femoral condyle of 20 skeletally mature mule sheep with and without a gap of 2.5 mm between the construct and the host bone. After 6 weeks, the addition of MSCs to the scaffolds did not significantly increase osseointegration or implant-bone fixation strength. However, in the defects with a gap, the cellularized constructs showed higher implant-bone contact area and implant-bone fixation strength. BTE can be applied to develop acellular or cellularized constructs with clinical application in rTHRs where a lack of bone stock is problematic.",

Methods: A total of 2023 respondents from eight European countries rated the importance of nine healthcare factors. The relative importance of these factors was compared within and between age groups, using mean score differences and logistic regression. Results: The most important item for all age groups was being listened to. Children rated pain control and the presence of parents more important than either understanding the doctor or being able to ask questions. Among adolescents, these differences disappeared for pain control and were reversed for parental presence. The changes in relative priorities between childhood and adolescence remained significant after adjusting for sex, long-standing illness and nationality (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: Healthcare priorities evolve significantly between childhood and early adolescence. However, being listened to is the most important priority at all ages.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a term used for oral mucosal pain (burning pain or discomfort in the tongue, lips or entire oral cavity) without identifiable cause. General population prevalence varies from 0.1% to 3.9%. Many BMS patients indicate anxiety, depression, personality disorders and impaired quality of life (QoL). This review updates the previous versions published in 2000 and 2005. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of any intervention versus placebo for symptom relief and changes in QoL, taste, and feeling of dryness in people with BMS. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 31 December 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched 31 December 2015), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2015), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2015). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment against placebo in people with BMS. The primary outcomes were symptom relief (pain/burning) and change in QoL. Secondary outcomes included change in taste, feeling of dryness, and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Outcome data were analysed as short-term (up to three months) or long-term (three to six months). Main results: We included 23 RCTs (1121 analysed participants; 83% female). Interventions were categorised as: antidepressants and antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, cholinergics, dietary supplements, electromagnetic radiation, physical barriers, psychological therapies, and topical treatments. Only one RCT was assessed at low risk of bias overall, four RCTs' risk of bias was unclear, and 18 studies were at high risk of bias. Overall quality of the evidence for effectiveness was very low for all interventions and all outcomes. Twenty-one RCTs assessed short-term symptom relief. There is very low-quality evidence of benefit from electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), topical benzodiazepines (two RCTs, 111 participants), physical barriers (one RCT, 50 participants), and anticonvulsants (one RCT, 100 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding the effectiveness of antidepressants, cholinergics, systemic benzodiazepines, dietary supplements or topical treatments. No RCT assessing psychological therapies evaluated short-term symptom relief. Four studies assessed long-term symptom relief. There is very low-quality evidence of a benefit from psychological therapies (one RCT, 30 participants), capsaicin oral rinse (topical treatment) (one RCT, 18 participants), and topical benzodiazepines (one RCT, 66 participants). We found no evidence of a difference for dietary supplements or lactoperoxidase oral rinse. No studies assessing antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation or physical barriers evaluated long-term symptom relief. Short-term change in QoL was assessed by seven studies (none long-term). The quality of evidence was very low. A benefit was found for electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), however findings were inconclusive for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, dietary supplements and physical barriers. Secondary outcomes (change in taste and feeling of dryness) were only assessed short-term, and the findings for both were also inconclusive. With regard to adverse effects, there is very low-quality evidence that antidepressants increase dizziness and drowsiness (one RCT, 37 participants), and that alpha lipoic acid increased headache (two RCTs, 118 participants) and gastrointestinal complaints (3 RCTs, 138 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding adverse events for anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines. Adverse events were poorly reported or unreported for cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation, and psychological therapies. No adverse events occurred from physical barriers or topical therapy use. Authors' conclusions: Given BMS' potentially disabling nature, the need to identify effective modes of treatment for sufferers is vital. Due to the limited number of clinical trials at low risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any interventions in managing BMS. Further clinical trials, with improved methodology and standardised outcome sets are required in order to establish which treatments are effective. Future studies are encouraged to assess the role of treatments used in other neuropathic pain conditions and psychological therapies in the treatment of BMS.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Understanding irrational actions may require the observer to make mental state inferences about why an action was performed. Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have well documented difficulties with mentalizing; however, the degree to which rationality understanding is impaired in autism is not yet clear. The present study uses eye-tracking to measure online understanding of action rationality in individuals with ASC. Twenty adults with ASC and 20 typically developing controls, matched for age and IQ watched movies of rational and irrational actions while their eye movements were recorded. Measures of looking time, scan path and saccade latency were calculated. Results from looking time and scan path analyses demonstrate that participants with ASC have reduced visual attention to salient action features such as the action goal and the hand performing the action, regardless of action rationality. However, when participants with ASC do attend to these features, they are able to make anticipatory goal saccades as quickly as typically developing controls. Taken together these results indicate that individuals with autism have reduced attention to observed actions, but when attention is maintained, goal prediction is typical. We conclude that the basic mechanisms of action understanding are intact in individuals with ASC although there may be impairment in the top-down, social modulation of eye movements.",

It argues that this oversight must be remedied as a matter of urgency so that the evolutionary model of progress that currently dominates the field can be countered. We describe the 'Hidden Histories' pilot project and explore the origins and practice of oral history; in the corresponding issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly, five oral history interviews that we carried out during the project are presented. We conclude that the selection of interviews presented here demonstrate that oral history is an important and productive methodology in such research. The five oral history interviews form primary sources, which can be used in the writing of a history of computing in the humanities; furthermore, they contain new information and interpretations, which cannot be gleaned from published scholarly articles, for example, information about the varied entry routes into the field that have existed and the interrelationship between myth and history in the narratives we create about the emergence of digital humanities.",

The main clinical features are proximal muscle weakness and skin rashes or other skin manifestations, but multiple organ systems can also be involved. Diagnosis is made using the 1975 Bohan and Peter diagnostic criteria (a gold standard for clinical trials) or by revised criteria from 2006 based on an international consensus survey process. Optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, and is based on immunosuppression combined with intensive physiotherapy. Initially medical treatment involves intravenous and oral corticosteroids with adjuvant disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and later biologic therapy. Randomised controlled trials are limited due to the low incidence but consensus on treatment has been agreed and is shown in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) protocol. Without treatment, mortality can be high but with early diagnosis and treatment the prognosis is good, with a third achieving full remission, a third having a cyclic, relapsing and remitting course and the remainder having an ulcerative chronic course.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.Abstract Detecting statistically significant trends in incidence with cancer registries data not only depends on the size of their covered population but also on the levels of incidence rates, duration of diagnostic period and type of temporal variation. We simulated sample sizes of newly diagnosed cases based on a variety of plausible levels of cancer rates and scenarios of changing trends over a period of about 30 years. Each simulated set of cases was then analysed with joinpoint regression models. The power was derived as the relative frequency of the simulation runs where the p-value of the coefficient was less than 0.05 under the alternative model. In case of a decreasing trend with no change of direction (join), an Annual Percentage Change (APC) of 1% for an average rate of 10 per 100,000 is detectable in populations of half a million inhabitants or more with a nominal power of 80%. In a model with one joinpoint followed by an increasing trend, the minimum detectable APC increases, and an APC of about 2%, can be detected only with populations of at least 2 million. For analyses requiring a larger sample size than the actual covered population, alternative organisational strategies should be considered, such as an extension of population coverage or data pooling and merging from registries with comparable data. (i.e. when heterogeneity across merging registries is low or acceptable for the specific study question).",

            "Abstract": "& Sons, Ltd.Despite extensive research into cartilage tissue engineering (CTE), there is still no scaffold ideal for clinical applications. Various synthetic and natural polymers have been investigated in vitro and in vivo, but none have reached widespread clinical use. The authors investigate the potential of POSS-PCU, a synthetic nanocomposite polymer, for use in CTE. POSS-PCU is modified with silsesquioxane nanostructures that improve its biological and physical properties. The ability of POSS-PCU to support the growth of ovine nasoseptal chondrocytes was evaluated against a polymer widely used in CTE, polycaprolactone (PCL). Scaffolds with varied concentrations of the POSS molecule were also synthesized to investigate their effect on chondrocyte growth. Chondrocytes were seeded onto scaffold disks (PCU negative control; POSS-PCU 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%; PCL). Cytocompatibilty was evaluated using cell viability, total DNA, collagen and GAG assays. Chondrocytes cultured on POSS-PCU (2% POSS) scaffolds had significantly higher viability than PCL scaffolds (p<0.001). Total DNA, collagen and sGAG protein were also greater on POSS-PCU scaffolds compared with PCL (p>0.05). POSS-PCU (6% and 8% POSS) had improved viability and proliferation over an 18day culture period compared with 2% and 4% POSS-PCU (p<0.0001). Increasing the percentage of POSS in the scaffolds increased the size of the pores found in the scaffolds (p<0.05). POSS-PCU has excellent potential for use in CTE. It supports the growth of chondrocytes in vitro and the POSS modification significantly enhances the growth and proliferation of nasoseptal chondrocytes compared with traditional scaffolds such as PCL. \u00a9 2015 John Wiley",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.How to allocate resources between somatic maintenance and reproduction in a manner that maximizes inclusive fitness is a fundamental challenge for all organisms. Life history theory predicts that effort put into somatic maintenance (health) should vary with sex, mating and parenting status because men and women have different costs of reproduction, and because life transitions such as family formation alter the fitness payoffs from investing in current versus future reproduction. However, few tests of how such life history parameters influence behaviours closely linked to survival exist. Here we examine whether specific forms of preventable death (accidents/suicides, alcohol-related causes, and other preventable diseases) are predicted by marital status and dependent offspring in a modern developed context; that of Northern Ireland. We predict that men, non-partnered individuals and individuals who do not have dependent offspring will be at higher risk of preventable death. Running survival analyses on the entire adult population (aged 16-59, n= 927,134) controlling for socioeconomic position (SEP) and other potential confounds, we find that being single (compared to cohabiting/married) increases risk of accidental/suicide death for men (but not for women), whereas having dependent children is associated with lower risk of preventable mortality for women but less so for men. We also find that the protective effect of partners is larger for men with low SEP than for high SEP men. Findings support life history predictions and suggest that individuals respond to variation in fitness costs linked to their mating and parenting status.",

            "Abstract": "Predictive frameworks of climate change extinction risk generally focus on the magnitude of climate change a species is expected to experience and the potential for that species to track suitable climate. A species' risk of extinction from climate change will depend, in part, on the magnitude of climate change the species experiences, its exposure. However, exposure is only one component of risk. A species' risk of extinction will also depend on its intrinsic ability to tolerate changing climate, its sensitivity. We examine exposure and sensitivity individually for two example taxa, terrestrial amphibians and mammals. We examine how these factors are related among species and across regions and how explicit consideration of each component of risk may affect predictions of climate change impacts. We find that species' sensitivities to climate change are not congruent with their exposures. Many highly sensitive species face low exposure to climate change and many highly exposed species are relatively insensitive. Separating sensitivity from exposure reveals patterns in the causes and drivers of species' extinction risk that may not be evident solely from predictions of climate change. Our findings emphasise the importance of explicitly including sensitivity and exposure to climate change in assessments of species' extinction risk.",

D\u00e1vila, Ed\u00e9sio Fernandes and Michael Mattingly 1999.This chapter looks at a number of experiences in metropolitan intermunicipal cooperation in Latin America. In the course of the 1990s international development agencies have become increasingly interested in cooperating directly with local authorities around the themes of environmental planning and management. Urban authorities are under considerable pressure from various, sometimes conflicting, interests to improve their performance. The pioneer local initiatives promoting sustainable urban development in Latin America were the metropolitan cities of Bogota and Curitiba. Regional metropolitan areas are characterised by dispersed and yet highly integrated settlement patterns within which several towns and cities with relatively low concentrations of population perform complementary functions in the provision of services and infrastructure and in the development of economic activities. Metropolitan environmental planning and management must address the challenge of improving local conditions without eroding the ecological capacities beyond their boundaries.",

In the current study, we investigated whether school neighbourhood socio-economic characteristics predicted teachers organizational and professional commitment. Primary school teachers (n = 1042) responded to surveys in 2000-2001 (baseline) and 2004 (follow-up). Their responses were linked to records of the school neighbourhood income and unemployment levels obtained from nationwide registers. Teachers working in areas with a high income level and low unemployment rate had longer job tenure and higher probability of organizational (school) commitment at follow-up compared to teachers working in areas with a low income level or high unemployment rate. Less consistent associations were found for professional commitment. These findings suggest that school neighbourhood characteristics may affect teachers work commitment, especially their organizational commitment. Further research is needed to determine whether this increases inequalities in childrens learning opportunities.",

The sampling was carried out with an Andersen six-stage viable impactor over a period of eight weeks. The highest mean concentration of total bacteria was found outdoors followed by the general ward, conventionally ventilated theatre and laminar flow theatre. With reference to Gram-negative bacteria, the general ward had the highest mean concentration followed by outdoors and the conventionally ventilated theatre. No Gram-negative bacteria were detected in the operating theatre with laminar flow. Similar to bacteria, the higher concentration of fungi was present outdoors and in the general ward as compared to the operation theatres. In general, higher concentrations were found in the conventionally ventilated theatre than the laminar flow theatre. In terms of size distribution, in the ward and outdoors the dominant bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were in the size range of 3.3-4.7-\u03bcm or 2.1-3.3-\u03bcm. The bacterial concentrations in the conventionally ventilated operating theatre were mostly in coarse size fraction compared to fine fraction for the theatre with laminar flow.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Texture modification has become one of the most common forms of intervention for dysphagia, and is widely considered important for promoting safe and efficient swallowing. However, to date, there is no single convention with respect to the terminology used to describe levels of liquid thickening or food texture modification for clinical use. As a first step toward building a common taxonomy, a systematic review was undertaken to identify empirical evidence describing the impact of liquid consistency and food texture on swallowing behavior. A multi-engine search yielded 10,147 non-duplicate articles, which were screened for relevance. A team of ten international researchers collaborated to conduct full-text reviews for 488 of these articles, which met the study inclusion criteria. Of these, 36 articles were found to contain specific information comparing oral processing or swallowing behaviors for at least two liquid consistencies or food textures. Qualitative synthesis revealed two key trends with respect to the impact of thickening liquids on swallowing: thicker liquids reduce the risk of penetration\u2013aspiration, but also increase the risk of post-swallow residue in the pharynx. The literature was insufficient to support the delineation of specific viscosity boundaries or other quantifiable material properties related to these clinical outcomes. With respect to food texture, the literature pointed to properties of hardness, cohesiveness, and slipperiness as being relevant both for physiological behaviors and bolus flow patterns. The literature suggests a need to classify food and fluid behavior in the context of the physiological processes involved in oral transport and flow initiation.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center.Background: The \"jumping to conclusions\" (JTC) data-gathering bias is implicated in the development and maintenance of psychosis but has only recently been studied in first episode psychosis (FEP). In this study, we set out to establish the relationship of JTC in FEP with delusions and neuropsychological functioning. Methods: One hundred and eight FEP patients and 101 age-matched controls completed assessments of delusions, general intelligence (IQ), working memory (WM), and JTC (the probabilistic reasoning \"beads\" task). Results: Half the FEP participants jumped to conclusions on at least 1 task, compared with 25% of controls (OR range 2.1 to 3.9; 95% CI range 1.5 to 8.0, P values \u2264. 02). JTC was associated with clinical, but not nonclinical delusion severity, and with neuropsychological functioning, irrespective of clinical status. Both IQ and delusion severity, but not WM, were independently associated with JTC in the FEP group. Conclusions: JTC is present in FEP. The specific association of JTC with clinical delusions supports a state, maintaining role for the bias. The associations of JTC with neuropsychological functioning indicate a separable, trait aspect to the bias, which may confer vulnerability to psychosis. The work has potential to inform emerging interventions targeting reasoning biases in early psychosis.",

            "Abstract": "Objective People with multiple sclerosis (MS) have difficulties with decision-making but it is unclear if this is due to changes in impulsivity, risk taking, deliberation or risk adjustment, and how this relates to brain pathology. Methods We assessed these aspects of decisionmaking in 105 people with MS and 43 healthy controls. We used a novel diffusion MRI method, diffusion orientational complexity (DOC), as an index of grey matter pathology in regions associated with decisionmaking and also measured grey matter tissue volumes and white matter lesion volumes. Results People with MS showed less adjustment to risk and slower decision-making than controls. Moreover, impaired decision-making correlated with reduced executive function, memory and processing speed. Decision-making impairments were most prevalent in people with secondary progressive MS. They were seen in patients with cognitive impairment and those without cognitive impairment. On diffusion MRI, people with MS showed DOC changes in all regions except the occipital cortex, relative to controls. Risk adjustment correlated with DOC in the hippocampi and deliberation time with DOC in the medial prefrontal, middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate and caudate parcellations and with white matter lesion volumes. Conclusions These data clarify the features of decision-making deficits in MS, and provide the first evidence that they relate to grey and white matter abnormalities seen using MRI.",

KGaA, Weinheim.Redox-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) has the scope to greatly improve upon current methods of data storage, despite incomplete understandings of material switching mechanisms. We make use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to characterise the physical processes occurring in the changes in conductance state in silicon-rich silicon oxide RRAM. Surface analyses of the insulating oxide layer of our devices are employed to establish the chemical and structural properties of pristine and switched states. The removal of oxygen from the active layer is observed to be concomitant with the appearance of varying degrees of surface distortion and regions of high conductivity in an otherwise-insulating material. These results support the currently-recognised model of a resistive switching mechanism that is reliant upon the migration of oxygen ions under an electrical bias.",

We highlight the need to move resilience thinking forward by emphasizing structural social-political processes, acknowledging and acting on differences between ecosystems and societies, and looking beyond the quantitative streamlining of resilience into one index.

Although first settled thousands of years ago and fitting its label as \u201cthe New World,\u201d the European colonial expansion initiated in the late 15th century resulted in people from virtually every corner of the globe subsequently settling in the Americas. The arrival of large numbers of immigrants led to a dramatic decline of the Native American population and extensive population mixing. A salient feature of the current human population of the Americas is, thus, its great diversity. The genetic variation of the Native peoples that recent immigrants encountered had been shaped by demographic events acting since the initial peopling of the continent. Similarly, but on a compressed timescale, the colonial history of the Americas has had a major impact on the genetic makeup of the current population of the continent. A range of genetic analyses has been used to study both the ancient settlement of the continent and more recent history of population mixing. Here, I show how these two strands of research overlap and make use of results from other scientific disciplines to produce a fuller picture of the settlement of the continent at different time periods. The biological diversity of the Americas also provides prominent examples of the complex interaction between biological and social factors in constructing human identities and of the difficulties in defining human populations.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 AlphaMed Press.Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus produce new neurons throughout adult life. NSCs are maintained in a state of reversible quiescence and the failure to maintain the quiescent state can result in the premature depletion of the stem cell pool. The epigenetic mechanisms that maintain this quiescent state have not been identified. Using an inducible knockout mouse model, we show that the chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) is essential for maintaining NSC quiescence. CHD7 inactivation in adult NSCs results in a loss of stem cell quiescence in the hippocampus, a transient increase in cell divisions, followed by a significant decline in neurogenesis. This loss of NSC quiescence is associated with the premature loss of NSCs in middle-aged mice. We find that CHD7 represses the transcription of several positive regulators of cell cycle progression and is required for full induction of the Notch target gene Hes5 in quiescent NSCs. These findings directly link CHD7 to pathways involved in NSC quiescence and identify the first chromatin-remodeling factor with a role in NSC quiescence and maintenance. As CHD7 haplo-insufficiency is associated with a range of cognitive disabilities in CHARGE syndrome, our observations may have implications for understanding the basis of these deficits.

All rights reserved.Objective: Reduced deactivation within the default mode network (DMN) is common in individuals with primary affective disorders relative to healthy volunteers (HVs). It is unknown whether similar network abnormalities are present in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with a history of affective psychopathology. Methods: 17 TLE patients with a lifetime affective diagnosis, 31 TLE patients with no formal psychiatric history and 30 HVs were included. We used a visuospatial 'n-back' paradigm to compare working memory (WM) network activation between these groups. Post hoc analyses included voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. The Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen and Beck Anxiety Inventory were completed on the day of scanning. Findings: Each group activated the fronto-parietal WM networks and deactivated the typical DMN in response to increasing task demands. Group comparison revealed that TLE patients with lifetime affective morbidity showed significantly greater deactivation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) than either the TLE-only or the HVs (p<0.001). This effect persisted after covarying for current psychotropic medication and severity of current depressive/anxiety symptoms (all p<0.001). Correlational analysis revealed that this finding was not driven by differences in task performance. There were no significant differences in grey matter volume or structural connectivity between the TLE groups. Conclusions: Our results provide novel evidence suggesting that affective psychopathology in TLE has a neurobiological correlate, and in this context the sACC performs differently compared with network activity in primary affective disorders.",

It is a consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October 2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.",

Short-term paediatric outcomes of surgery are well reported and survival into adulthood is now usual, but long-term outcome data are less comprehensive. Chronic renal failure is reported to occur in 50 % of patients with cloacal anomalies, and 26\u201372 % (dependant on the length of the common channel) of patients experience urinary incontinence in adult life. Defaecation is normal in 53 % of patients, with some managed by methods other than surgery, including medication, washouts, stoma and antegrade continent enema. Gynaecological anomalies are common and can necessitate reconstructive surgery at adolescence for menstrual obstruction. No data are currently available on sexual function and little on the quality of life. Pregnancy is extremely rare and highly risky. Patient care should be provided by a multidisciplinary team with experience in managing these and other related complex congenital malformations.

In this work, we present a generalized and extended formulation of the boundary shift integral (gBSI) using probabilistic segmentations to estimate anatomic changes between 2 time points. This method adaptively estimates a non-binary exclusive OR region of interest from probabilistic brain segmentations of the baseline and repeat scans to better localize and capture the brain atrophy. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing the sample size requirements for a hypothetical clinical trial of Alzheimer's disease to that needed for the current implementation of BSI as well as a fuzzy implementation of BSI. The gBSI method results in a modest but reduced sample size, providing increased sensitivity to disease changes through the use of the probabilistic exclusive OR region.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Springer-Verlag London 2015.Worldwide, gynaecological cancers (cervical, ovarian and endometrial) account for an estimated 17 % of all new cancer cases in women and 14.6 % of all female cancer deaths. To reduce the burden of the disease, major efforts have focused on prevention through screening or improvements in treatment. Over the last 50 years, screening for cervical cancer has significantly reduced mortality in the developed world. This is not mirrored in low income countries where the majority of cases occur. There is therefore an immediate need to develop alternative screening strategies in low resource setting. Cytology and HPV testing are the main tests used in the developed world with visual inspection or cheaper HPV tests used in low resource settings. Whether screening impacts on ovarian cancer mortality is still unclear. The results from the large screening trials in the general population and women at high risk will be available in 2015. It is likely that the recent insights into ovarian cancer tumour biology and heterogeneity will impact on the screening tests/strategies used in the future to target those accounting for most of the mortality. Screening for endometrial cancer is only recommended in women at high risk as part of the Lynch Syndrome families. In the general population, screening is not recommended as majority of women present with symptoms and at early stage. However, in view of the anticipated increase in endometrial cancer related to the obesity epidemic and aging, the focus over the next 5 years will be on developing novel screening approaches/risk stratification tools.",

Aims To develop a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) manual for anxiety in dementia and determine its feasibility through a randomised controlled trial. Method A ten-session CBT manual was developed. Participants with dementia and anxiety (and their carers) were randomly allocated to CBT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25) or TAU (n = 25). Outcome and cost measures were administered at baseline, 15 weeks and 6 months. Results At 15 weeks, there was an adjusted difference in anxiety (using the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale) of (73.10, 95% CI 76.55 to 0.34) for CBT compared with TAU, which just fell short of statistical significance. There were significant improvements in depression at 15 weeks after adjustment (75.37, 95% CI 79.50 to 71.25). Improvements remained significant at 6 months. CBT was cost neutral. Conclusions CBT was feasible (in terms of recruitment, acceptability and attrition) and effective. A fully powered RCT is now required.",

All rights reserved.Purpose of review Epilepsy neuroimaging is important for detecting the seizure onset zone, predicting and preventing deficits from surgery and illuminating mechanisms of epileptogenesis. An aspiration is to integrate imaging and genetic biomarkers to enable personalized epilepsy treatments. Recent findings The ability to detect lesions, particularly focal cortical dysplasia and hippocampal sclerosis, is increased using ultra high-field imaging and postprocessing techniques such as automated volumetry, T2 relaxometry, voxel-based morphometry and surface-based techniques. Statistical analysis of PET and single photon emission computer tomography (STATISCOM) are superior to qualitative analysis alone in identifying focal abnormalities in MRI-negative patients. These methods have also been used to study mechanisms of epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance. Recent language fMRI studies aim to localize, and also lateralize language functions. Memory fMRI has been recommended to lateralize mnemonic function and predict outcome after surgery in temporal lobe epilepsy. Summary Combinations of structural, functional and post-processing methods have been used in multimodal and machine learning models to improve the identification of the seizure onset zone and increase understanding of mechanisms underlying structural and functional aberrations in epilepsy.",

This study sets out to investigate the relationship between health status [EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)] in primary SS and three of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS outcome measures-the disease activity index (ESSDAI), the patient reported index (ESSPRI) and the sicca score. In particular, the goal was to establish whether there is a relationship between the EULAR outcome measures and quality of life. Methods. Health status was evaluated using a standardized measure developed by the EuroQol Group-the EQ5D. This permits calculation of two measures of health status: time trade-off (TTO) values and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. We used Spearman's rank correlation analysis to investigate the strength of association between health status and three EULAR measures of physicianand patient-reported disease activity in 639 patients from the UK primary SS registry (UKPSSR) cohort. Results. This study demonstrates that the EULAR SS disease-specific outcome measures are significantly correlated with health outcome values (P<0.001). Higher scores on the ESSDAI, EULAR sicca score and ESSPRI are associated with poorer health states-i.e. lower TTO values and lower VAS scores. While all three are significantly correlated with TTO values and EQ-5D VAS scores, the effect is strongest for the ESSPRI. Conclusion. This study provides further evidence supporting the use of ESSDAI, EULAR sicca score and ESSPRI measures in the clinic. We also discuss the need for disease-specific measures of health status and their comparison with standardized health outcome measures.",

            "Abstract": "Objectives: Advance care planning (ACP) can help patients with a terminal illness to prepare for the end of their lives. This report describes a regional service improvement initiative to increase the identification of hospital inpatients at this stage in their illnesses and to increase the number of such patients who are offered the opportunity to start the process of ACP. Methods: Data were collected prospectively over a 7 month period from four acute hospital trusts and a specialist cancer centre in the South-West London region. Each unit identified a specific patient population who were screened for eligibility to engage in the process of ACP. Data concerning the reasons for eligibility, the suitability for discussion and the various reasons why patients did not complete the process, were recorded. Results: Over a 7 month period 1980 patients were screened and 559 (28.2%) were found to be potentially eligible for an ACP discussion. Of these 227/559 (40.6%) were deemed suitable for a discussion by medical staff. The majority of these patients (195/227; 86%) were offered the opportunity to undergo ACP discussions and 144/ 195 (73.8%) agreed to begin the process of ACP. Conclusions: This report shows that a targeted approach can result in increased uptake in the number of patients who engage in ACP. However, systematic identification of potentially eligible patients requires a significant investment of clinical time and resources.",

All rights reserved.Cdc kinase subunit (Cks) proteins Cks1 and Cks2 are adaptor-like proteins that bind many cyclin-dependent kinases. A wealth of clinical data has shown that Cks proteins are overexpressed in many types of human cancers and this often correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness. Previously, we showed that Cks overexpression abrogates the intra-S-phase checkpoint, a major barrier to oncogene-mediated transformation. Interestingly, the intra-S-phase checkpoint is crucial for the cellular response to replication stress, a major pathway of apoptosis induction by many chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate cancer cells that overexpress Cks1 or Cks2 override the intra-S-phase checkpoint in the presence of replication stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate (MTX) leading to enhanced sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, enforced expression of Cks1 in an MTX-resistant breast cancer cell line was found to restore drug sensitivity. Our results suggest that Cks proteins are important determinants of apoptosis induction of replication stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-FU.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Purpose To establish the experimental factors that dominate the uncertainty of hemodynamic parameters in commonly used pharmacokinetic models. Methods By fitting simulation results from a multiregion tissue exchange model (Multiple path, Multiple tracer, Indicator Dilution, 4 region), the precision and accuracy of hemodynamic parameters in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with four tracer kinetic models is investigated. The impact of various injection rates as well as imprecise knowledge of the arterial input functions is examined. Results Fast injections are beneficial for Ktrans precision within the extended Tofts model and within the two-compartment exchange model but do not affect the other models under investigation. Biases from errors in the arterial input functions are mostly consistent in size and direction for the simple and the extended Tofts model, while they are hardly predictable for the other models. Errors in the hematocrit introduce the greatest loss in parameter accuracy, amounting to an average Ktrans bias of 40% for a 30% overestimation throughout all models. Conclusion This simulation study allows the detailed inspection of the isolated impact from various experimental conditions on parameter uncertainty. Because parameter uncertainty comparable to human studies was found, this study represents a validation of preclinical dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for modeling human tumor physiology.

First, relatedness is measured as the intensity of input\u2013output linkages between industries. Second, this measure is employed to examine industry evolution in 360 US metropolitan areas. Third, an employment-weighted measure of metropolitan technological cohesion is developed. The results confirm that technological relatedness is positively related to metropolitan industry portfolio membership and industry entry and negatively related to industry exit. The decomposition of technological cohesion indicates that the selection of related incumbent industries complements industry entry and exit as the main drivers of change in metropolitan technological cohesion.",

Eld. group, age >80 years) and compare their outcomes to a less elderly cohort (Eld. group, age 75-80 years) traditionally reported in the literature. Background: Limited data exist on peri-procedural and long-term outcomes following PCI in the V. Eld. (age >80 years), with under-representation of this cohort in randomized controlled trials. These patients present with advanced complex coronary disease and multiple comorbidities. Methods: All 580 consecutive patients aged \u226575 years (age 80 \u00b1 4.9 years, 57.4% males) undergoing PCI between April 2006 and November 2011 were included. A total of 624 consecutive lesions were identified and analyzed. All V. Eld. patients (n = 253) were subsequently selected, and their outcomes compared to Eld. patients (n = 327). Mean follow-up was 30.8 \u00b1 2.7 months with 98% clinical follow-up achieved. Results: All comparative data are expressed as (V. Eld. vs Eld.) unless otherwise specified. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the V. Eld. group (11.9% vs 6.1%), although this did not translate into a significant difference in cardiac mortality (6.3% vs 3.7%) or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (16.2% vs 12.5%). The composite incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, definite/probable stent thrombosis, and TIMI major bleed was 4.7%, 1.4% 1.9%, and 6.4%, respectively with no significant difference between both cohorts. Conclusions: This study demonstrates an acceptable occurrence of MI, death, repeat intervention, and stent thrombosis in a high-risk group of V. Eld. patients with de novo lesions. Age alone in the absence of other non-cardiac factors should not prohibit a patient from access to PCI.",

Through direct measurement of the atmospheric chemical composition of hundreds of exoplanets, EChO would address fundamental questions such as: What are exoplanets made of? How do planets form and evolve? What is the origin of exoplanet diversity? More specifically, EChO is a dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large, diverse and well-defined planetary sample within its four to six year mission lifetime. In this paper we use the end-to-end instrument simulator EChOSim to model the currently discovered targets, to gauge which targets are observable and assess the EChO performances obtainable for each observing tier and time. We show that EChO would be capable of observing over 170 relativity diverse planets if it were launched today, and the wealth of optimal targets for EChO expected to be discovered in the next 10 years by space and ground-based facilities is simply overwhelming. In addition, we build on previous molecular detectability studies to show what molecules and abundances will be detectable by EChO for a selection of real targets with various molecular compositions and abundances. EChO\u2019s unique contribution to exoplanetary science will be in identifying the main constituents of hundreds of exoplanets in various mass/temperature regimes, meaning that we will be looking no longer at individual cases but at populations. Such a universal view is critical if we truly want to understand the processes of planet formation and evolution in various environments. In this paper we present a selection of key results.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Severe fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects 1 in 500 pregnancies, is untreatable, and causes serious neonatal morbidity and death. Reduced uterine blood flow (UBF) is one cause. Transduction of uterine arteries in normal and FGR animal models using an adenovirus (Ad) encoding VEGF isoforms increases UBF and improves fetal growth in utero. Understanding potential adverse consequences of this therapy before first-in-woman clinical application is essential. The aims of this study were to determine whether Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C (1) transfers across the human placental barrier and (2) affects human placental morphology, permeability and primary indicators of placental function, and trophoblast integrity. Villous explants from normal term human placentas were treated with Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C (5 \u00d7 107-10 virus particles [vp]/mL), or virus formulation buffer (FB). Villous structural integrity (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and tissue accessibility (LacZ immunostaining) were determined. Markers of endocrine function (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] secretion) and cell death (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] release) were assayed. Lobules from normal and FGR pregnancies underwent ex vivo dual perfusion with exposure to 5 \u00d7 1010 vp/mL Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C or FB. Perfusion resistance, para-cellular permeability, hCG, alkaline phosphatase, and LDH release were measured. Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C transfer across the placental barrier was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in DNA extracted from fetal-side venous perfusate, and by immunohistochemistry in fixed tissue. Villous explant structural integrity and hCG secretion was maintained at all Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C doses. Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C perfusion revealed no effect on placental permeability, fetoplacental vascular resistance, hCG secretion, or alkaline phosphatase release, but there was a minor elevation in maternal-side LDH release. Viral vector tissue access in both explant and perfused models was minimal, and the vector was rarely detected in the fetal venous perfusate and at low titer. Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C did not markedly affect human placental integrity and function in vitro. There was limited tissue access and transfer of vector across the placental barrier. Except for a minor elevation in LDH release, these test data did not reveal any toxic effects of Ad.VEGF-D\u0394N\u0394C on the human placenta.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objectives: Many children with HIV infection now survive into adulthood. This study explored the impact of vertically acquired HIV in the era of antiretroviral therapy on the development of humoral immunity. Design: Natural and vaccine-related immunity to pneumococcus and B-cell phenotype was characterized and compared in three groups of young adults: those with vertically-acquired infection, those with horizontally acquired infection and healthy controls. Methods: Serotype-specific pneumococcal (Pnc) immunoglobulin M and G concentrations before and up to 1 year post-Pnc polysaccharide (Pneumovax) immunization were determined, and opsonophagocytic activity was analysed. B-cell subpopulations and dynamic markers of B-cell signalling, turnover and susceptibility to apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: HIV-infected patients showed impaired natural Pnc immunity and reduced humoral responses to immunization with Pneumovax; this was greatest in those viraemic at time of the study. Early-life viral control before the age of 10 years diminished these changes. Expanded populations of abnormally activated and immature B-cells were seen in both HIV-infected cohorts. Vertically infected patients were particularly vulnerable to reductions in marginal zone and switched memory populations. These aberrations were reduced in patients with early-life viral control. Conclusion: In children with HIV, damage to B-cell memory populations and impaired natural and vaccine immunity to pneumococcus is evident in early adult life. Sustained viral control from early childhood may help to limit this effect and optimize humoral immunity in adult life.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry.Background and aim: People with epilepsy are at increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to ECG-confirmed ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, as seen in a community-based study. We aimed to determine whether ECG-risk markers of SCA are more prevalent in people with epilepsy. Methods: In a cross-sectional, retrospective study, we analysed the ECG recordings of 185 people with refractory epilepsy and 178 controls without epilepsy. Data on epilepsy characteristics, cardiac comorbidity, and drug use were collected, and general ECG variables (heart rate (HR), PQ and QRS intervals) assessed. We analysed ECGs for three markers of SCA risk: severe QTc prolongation (male >450 ms, female >470 ms), Brugada ECG pattern, and early repolarisation pattern (ERP). Multivariate regression models were used to analyse differences between groups, and to identify associated clinical and epilepsy-related characteristics. Results: People with epilepsy had higher HR (71 vs 62 bpm, p<0.001) and a longer PQ interval (162.8 vs 152.6 ms, p=0.001). Severe QTc prolongation and ERP were more prevalent in people with epilepsy (QTc prolongation: 5% vs 0%; p=0.002; ERP: 34% vs 13%, p<0.001), while the Brugada ECG pattern was equally frequent in both groups (2% vs 1%, p>0.999). After adjustment for covariates, epilepsy remained associated with ERP (ORadj 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.5) and severe QTc prolongation (ORadj 9.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 1317.7). Conclusions: ERP and severe QTc prolongation appear to be more prevalent in people with refractory epilepsy. Future studies must determine whether this contributes to increased SCA risk in people with epilepsy.",

Examining conservation problems solely from the perspective of the species or habitat that is put under pressure simply leads to a rapidly escalating list of ever-more-difficult problems. Solutions are hard to find, especially solutions that will be effective over longer time periods. In fact, conservation is almost never this straightforward anyway. It is much more complex and usually there are many different winners and losers in different sectors of society, and often over time and in different places as well. No wonder, then, that progress tomeet conservation targets has been so challenging. As the authors in this book show over and over again, the apparent conflicts between people and the environment are better tackled by appreciating that the conflicts are actually between different groups of people. While sometimes the conflicts are very clear, especially to conservationists working on the front line who encounter stakeholders with different perspectives, this is rarely the case, and it is even rarer that the issues can be simply or neatly circumscribed.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).The frontal pole corresponds to Brodmann area (BA) 10, the largest single architectonic area in the human frontal lobe. Generally, BA10 is thought to contain two or three subregions that subserve broad functions such as multitasking, social cognition, attention, and episodic memory. However, there is a substantial debate about the functional and structural heterogeneity of this large frontal region. Previous connectivity-based parcellation studies have identified two or three subregions in the human frontal pole. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging to assess structural connectivity of BA10 in 35 healthy subjects and delineated subregions based on this connectivity. This allowed us to determine the correspondence of structurally based subregions with the scheme previously defined functionally. Three subregions could be defined in each subject. However, these three subregions were not spatially consistent between subjects. Therefore, we accepted a solution with two subregions that encompassed the lateral and medial frontal pole. We then examined resting-state functional connectivity of the two subregions and found significant differences between their connectivities. The medial cluster was connected to nodes of the default-mode network, which is implicated in internally focused, self-related thought, and social cognition. The lateral cluster was connected to nodes of the executive control network, associated with directed attention and working memory. These findings support the concept that there are two major anatomical subregions of the frontal pole related to differences in functional connectivity.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.Background The compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a potent monoamine releaser that produces an acute euphoria in most individuals. Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced-order study, MDMA was orally administered to 25 physically and mentally healthy individuals. Arterial spin labeling and seed-based resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) were used to produce spatial maps displaying changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and RSFC after MDMA administration. Participants underwent two arterial spin labeling and two blood oxygen level-dependent scans in a 90-minute scan session; MDMA and placebo study days were separated by 1 week. Results Marked increases in positive mood were produced by MDMA. Decreased CBF only was observed after MDMA, and this was localized to the right medial temporal lobe (MTL), thalamus, inferior visual cortex, and the somatosensory cortex. Decreased CBF in the right amygdala and hippocampus correlated with ratings of the intensity of global subjective effects of MDMA. The RSFC results complemented the CBF results, with decreases in RSFC between midline cortical regions, the medial prefrontal cortex, and MTL regions, and increases between the amygdala and hippocampus. There were trend-level correlations between these effects and ratings of intense and positive subjective effects. Conclusions The MTLs appear to be specifically implicated in the mechanism of action of MDMA, but further work is required to elucidate how the drug's characteristic subjective effects arise from its modulation of spontaneous brain activity.",

However, most studies do not include adolescents, individuals who purge in the absence of binge eating, or those purging at subclinical frequency. This study examines the prevalence of purging among 16-year-old girls across three countries and their association with substance use and psychological comorbidity.Methods: Data were obtained by questionnaire in 3 population-based cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), United Kingdom, n = 1,608; Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), USA, n = 3,504; North Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC85/86), Finland, n = 2,306). Multivariate logistic regressions were employed to estimate associations between purging and outcomes. Four models were fit adjusting for binge eating and potential confounders of these associations.Results: In ALSPAC, 9.7% of girls reported purging in the 12-months prior to assessment, 7.3% in GUTS, and 3.5% in NFBC. In all 3 cohorts, purging was associated with adverse outcomes such as binge drinking (ALSPAC: odds ratio (OR) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-2.9; GUTS: OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5-4.0; NFBC: OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), drug use (ALSPAC: OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.8-4.7; GUTS: OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.8-7.3; NFBC: OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.6-6.6), depressive symptoms in ALSPAC (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5-3.1) and GUTS(OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.2-6.3), and several psychopathology measures including clinical anxiety/depression in NFBC (OR = 11.2, 95% CI = 3.9, 31.7).Conclusions: Results show a higher prevalence of purging behaviours among girls in the United Kingdom compared to those in the United States and Finland. Our findings support evidence highlighting that purging in adolescence is associated with negative outcomes, independent of its frequency and binge eating.",

A recent, bedside psychophysical intervention, namely self-observation by video replay, lead to a lasting remission of severe AHP in an acute stroke patient (Fotopoulou, A., Rudd, A., Holmes, P., & Kopelman, M. (2009). Self-observation reinstates motor awareness in anosognosia for hemiplegia. Neuropsychologia, 47, 1256-1260). This procedure has been adjusted and applied here, as the basis of two intervention protocols administered independently to two patients with severe AHP. The first study used multiple, successive sessions of video-based self-observation in an acute patient, targeting first the awareness of upper limb and subsequently lower limb paralysis. The second study used a single session of video-based, self- and other-observation in a patient at the chronic stage following onset. Both protocols also involved elements of rapport building and emotional support. The results revealed that video-based self-observation had dramatic, immediate effects on awareness in both acute and chronic stages and it seemed to act as an initial trigger for eventual symptom remission. Nevertheless, these effects did not automatically generalise to all functional domains. This study provides provisional support that video-based self-observation may be included in wider rehabilitation programmes for the management and restoration of anosognosia.",

Objective: The aim of this study is to examine whether the extent and severity of WM tract damage differ between cognitively impaired (CI) and cognitively preserved (CP) secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. Methods: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI were acquired from 30 SPMS patients and 32 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive domains commonly affected in MS patients were assessed. Linear regression was used to predict cognition. Diffusion measures were compared between groups using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: A total of 12 patients were classified as CI, and processing speed was the most commonly affected domain. The final regression model including demographic variables and radial diffusivity explained the greatest variance of cognitive performance (R2 = 0.48, p = 0.002). SPMS patients showed widespread loss of WM integrity throughout the WM skeleton when compared with HC. When compared with CP patients, CI patients showed more extensive and severe damage of several WM tracts, including the fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus and forceps major. Conclusion: Loss of WM integrity assessed using TBSS helps to explain cognitive decline in SPMS patients.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: We report the case of a female infant with hypoparathyroidism due to an activating mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene. Case Report: The child presented in the neonatal period with clinical seizures associated with severe hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, low parathyroid hormone levels and elevated urine calcium:creatinine ratios. She required intravenous calcium and phenobarbitone initially, and then oral 1-alfacalcidol (1-AC) and phenobarbitone were started. The patient had intractable hypocalcaemia in the first 5 months of life despite escalating doses of 1-AC. When the phenobarbitone was stopped at 5 months of age she was admitted soon after with symptomatic hypercalcaemia. We postulate that the phenobarbitone increased the metabolism of 1-AC and thus she needed large doses of 1-AC to treat hypocalcaemia until the phenobarbitone was stopped. Her parents had no biochemical abnormalities on testing. Results: Molecular genetic analysis confirmed that our patient had a de novo missense variant, c.682G>A (p.Glu228Lys) in exon 4 of the calcium-sensing receptor. Conclusion: This case report highlights the importance that clinicians caring for children on vitamin D and its analogues are aware of the interaction with phenobarbitone, which can result in symptomatic hypocalcaemia. 1-AC should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C, otherwise it will be rendered inactive.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author.In adults, patterns of neural activation associated with perhaps the most basic language skill-overt object naming-are extensively modulated by the psycholinguistic and visual complexity of the stimuli. Do children's brains react similarly when confronted with increasing processing demands, or they solve this problem in a different way? Here we scanned 37 children aged 7-13 and 19 young adults who performed a well-normed picture-naming task with 3 levels of difficulty. While neural organization for naming was largely similar in childhood and adulthood, adults had greater activation in all naming conditions over inferior temporal gyri and superior temporal gyri/supramarginal gyri. Manipulating naming complexity affected adults and children quite differently: neural activation, especially over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, showed complexity-dependent increases in adults, but complexity-dependent decreases in children. These represent fundamentally different responses to the linguistic and conceptual challenges of a simple naming task that makes no demands on literacy or metalinguistics. We discuss how these neural differences might result from different cognitive strategies used by adults and children during lexical retrieval/production as well as developmental changes in brain structure and functional connectivity.",

It is most often associated with stroke and is more severe and persistent following right hemisphere damage, with reported frequencies in the acute stage of up to 80%. Neglect is primarily a disorder of attention whereby patients characteristically fail to orientate, to report or to respond to stimuli located on the contralesional side. Neglect is usually caused by large strokes in the middle cerebral artery territory and is heterogeneous, such that most patients do not manifest every feature of the syndrome. A number of treatments may improve neglect, but there is no widely accepted universal approach to therapy. Although most patients recover spontaneously, the evidence suggests that they continue to have significant cognitive impairments, particularly relating to attention.",

Straight Choices provides an integrative account of the psychology of decision making, in which clear connections are made between empirical results and how these results can help us to understand our uncertain world. Throughout the text, there is an emphasis on the relationship between learning and decision making. The authors argue that the best way to understand how and why decisions are made is in the context of the learning and knowledge acquisition that precedes them and the feedback that follows them. The mechanisms of learning and the structure of environments in which decisions are made are carefully examined to explore the ways in which they act on our choices. From this, the authors go on to consider whether we are all constrained to fall prey to biases or whether with sufficient exposure can we find optimal decision strategies and improve our decision making. This novel approach integrates findings from the decision and learning literatures to provide a unique perspective on the psychology of decision making. It will be of interest to researchers and students in cognitive psychology, as well as researchers in economics and philosophy interested in the nature of decision making.",

Buchli argues that this is evident in a number of cultural projects, including anti-consumerism and asceticism, as well as other attempts to transcend material circumstances. Exploring the cultural work which can be achieved when the material is rejected, and the social effects of these 'dematerialisations', this book situates the way some people disengage from the world as a specific kind of physical engagement which has profound implications for our understanding of personhood and materiality. Using case studies which range widely in time over Western societies and the technologies of materialising the immaterial, from icons to the scanning tunnelling microscope and 3-D printing, Buchli addresses the significance of immateriality for our own economics, cultural perceptions, and emerging forms of social inclusion and exclusion. An Archaeology of the Immaterial is thus an important and innovative contribution to material cultural studies which demonstrates that the making of the immaterial is, like the making of the material, a profoundly powerful operation which works to exert social control and delineate the borders of the imaginable and the enfranchised.",

The analysis searches for top quark pair events in which one top quark decays to Wb, with the W boson decaying leptonically, and the other top quark decays to Hq. The search is based on pp collisions at (Formula Presented.) TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and uses an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb\u22121. Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon and at least four jets. The search exploits the high multiplicity of b-quark jets characteristic of signal events, and employs a likelihood discriminant that uses the kinematic differences between the signal and the background, which is dominated by (Formula Presented.) decays. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, and observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits of 0.56% (0.42%) and 0.61% (0.64%) are derived for the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios respectively. The combination of this search with other ATLAS searches in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 WW*, \u03c4\u03c4 decay modes significantly improves the sensitivity, yielding observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits on the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios of 0.46% (0.25%) and 0.45% (0.29%) respectively. The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the |\u03bbtcH| and |\u03bbtuH| couplings are 0.13 (0.10) and 0.13 (0.10) respectively.

            "Abstract": "Background and aims: We studied damage accrual and factors determining development and progression of damage in an international cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Methods: The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Inception Cohort recruited patients within 15 months of developing four or more 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE; the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI) was measured annually. We assessed relative rates of transition using maximum likelihood estimation in a multistate model. The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the probabilities for time to first increase in SDI score and Cox regression analysis was used to assess mortality. Results: We recruited 1722 patients; mean (SD) age 35.0 (13.4) years at cohort entry. Patients with damage at enrolment were more likely to have further worsening of SDI (SDI 0 vs \u22651; p<0.001). Age, USA African race/ethnicity, SLEDAI-2K score, steroid use and hypertension were associated with transition from no damage to damage, and increase(s) in pre-existing damage. Male gender (relative transition rates (95% CI) 1.48 (1.06 to 2.08)) and USA Caucasian race/ethnicity (1.63 (1.08 to 2.47)) were associated with SDI 0 to \u22651 transitions; Asian race/ethnicity patients had lower rates of new damage (0.60 (0.39 to 0.93)). Antimalarial use was associated with lower rates of increases in pre-existing damage (0.63 (0.44 to 0.89)). Damage was associated with future mortality (HR (95% CI) 1.46 (1.18 to 1.81) per SDI point). Conclusions: Damage in SLE predicts future damage accrual and mortality. We identified several potentially modifiable risk factors for damage accrual; an integrated strategy to address these may improve long-term outcomes.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017, IPNA.Background: Relapses of childhood nephrotic syndrome (NS) are frequently precipitated by viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). A review of the literature reveals that in patients with steroid-dependent NS on alternate day corticosteroids, a short course of daily corticosteroid therapy during the course of an URTI may reduce relapse frequency. Objective: To assess the effect of a short course of low-dose corticosteroid therapy during the course of an URTI on relapse frequency in patients with steroid-sensitive NS who have not been taking any treatment for a minimum period of 3 months. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted on 48 patients with idiopathic NS who had not been receiving corticosteroid therapy for a minimum of 3 months. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group A received 5 days of daily prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg at the onset of an URTI while group B received 5 days of placebo. Both groups were followed up for 1 year and the URTI-induced relapse frequency was noted. A crossover was performed during the next year, with group A receiving placebo and group B receiving prednisolone. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study. In the treatment group, 115 episodes of URTI led to 11 relapses while in the control group 101 episodes of URTI led to 25 relapses. There was no significant difference between the mean number of URTIs between the treatment and control groups. The treatment group had significantly less relapses compared to the control group (p = 0.014). Within the treatment group, 65.6% did not relapse, while the remainder had a single relapse. In contrast, only 40.6% of the control group remained in remission while 40.6% suffered a single relapse and 18.8% had two or more relapses. Conclusions: Prescribing a short course of daily corticosteroids during an URTI significantly reduces the frequency of URTI-induced relapse in patients with steroid-responsive NS who are off corticosteroid therapy.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 SAGE Publications.Background Recent literature on the comparison of machine learning methods has raised questions about the neutrality, unbiasedness and utility of many comparative studies. Reporting of results on favourable datasets and sampling error in the estimated performance measures based on single samples are thought to be the major sources of bias in such comparisons. Better performance in one or a few instances does not necessarily imply so on an average or on a population level and simulation studies may be a better alternative for objectively comparing the performances of machine learning algorithms. Methods We compare the classification performance of a number of important and widely used machine learning algorithms, namely the Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN). Using massively parallel processing on high-performance supercomputers, we compare the generalisation errors at various combinations of levels of several factors: number of features, training sample size, biological variation, experimental variation, effect size, replication and correlation between features. Results For smaller number of correlated features, number of features not exceeding approximately half the sample size, LDA was found to be the method of choice in terms of average generalisation errors as well as stability (precision) of error estimates. SVM (with RBF kernel) outperforms LDA as well as RF and kNN by a clear margin as the feature set gets larger provided the sample size is not too small (at least 20). The performance of kNN also improves as the number of features grows and outplays that of LDA and RF unless the data variability is too high and/or effect sizes are too small. RF was found to outperform only kNN in some instances where the data are more variable and have smaller effect sizes, in which cases it also provide more stable error estimates than kNN and LDA. Applications to a number of real datasets supported the findings from the simulation study.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Appraisal of a stressful situation and the possibility to control or avoid it is thought to involve frontal-cortical mechanisms. The precise mechanism underlying this appraisal and its translation into effective stress coping (the regulation of physiological and behavioural responses) are poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational model which involves tuning motivational arousal to the appraised stressing condition. The model provides a causal explanation of the shift from active to passive coping strategies, i.e. from a condition characterised by high motivational arousal, required to deal with a situation appraised as stressful, to a condition characterised by emotional and motivational withdrawal, required when the stressful situation is appraised as uncontrollable/unavoidable. The model is motivated by results acquired via microdialysis recordings in rats and highlights the presence of two competing circuits dominated by different areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex: these are shown having opposite effects on several subcortical areas, affecting dopamine outflow in the striatum, and therefore controlling motivation. We start by reviewing published data supporting structure and functioning of the neural model and present the computational model itself with its essential neural mechanisms. Finally, we show the results of a new experiment, involving the condition of repeated inescapable stress, which validate most of the model\u2019s predictions.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: There are now a large number of requests for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoantibody (NMDAR-Ab) tests, and it is important to assess the clinical relevance of all results, particularly when they are reported as 'Low Positive'. Methods: The clinical data of 56 patients found Positive or Low Positive by the Oxford live cell-based assay were reviewed. An autoimmune basis for the condition was assigned as 'Definite', 'Possible' or 'Unlikely'. The number of core features (encephalopathy, psychiatric, cognitive, epileptic, extrapyramidal and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) was tabulated. Results: Twenty-five (44.6%) patients had a Definite NMDAR-Ab encephalitis (eight ovarian teratomas, one Hodgkin's lymphoma), 18 (32.1%) a Possible NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and 13 (23.2%) an Unlikely autoimmune syndrome. Serum NMDAR-Ab levels were higher in patients with tumours. Positive NMDAR-Abs were found not only in patients with three or more core features and a Definite syndrome, but also in five patients classified as Possible. Conversely, Low Positive NMDAR-Abs were present in 7 Definite cases as well as in 13 Possible cases. Unlikely patients had mainly Low Positive antibodies and fewer core features. CSF NMDAR-Abs, only available in 11 pairs and at varying time points, broadly related to serum levels and were Positive in 3/3 patients with tumours but in only 2/5 Definite patients, and none of the Possible or Unlikely cases. Interpretation: Using live cell-based assays, Positive and Low Positive antibodies can be of clinical significance. The number of core clinical features should help to select those patients in whom an immunotherapy intervention might be considered, irrespective of the antibody level.",

To inform policy-making and research, it is crucial to have access to sufficient comprehensive datasets linking these topics. Large scale surveys rarely combine questions on transport, health and sustainability, limiting their usefulness in research and policy-making. This project set out to identify the gaps in administrative and survey datasets to link health outcomes to travel behaviour and the quality of the environment; investigate the impact this has on research and policy-making; assess how these gaps might be addressed; and identify what the needs are for joined datasets. To achieve this, the project interviewed key decision-makers and stakeholders across England, including civil servants within national or local government and third sector organisations. The results highlight gaps within national datasets; the insufficient links between health, transport, and sustainability datasets; and the need for further joined data in various fields, in particular active travel, health and wellbeing. Participants suggested several solutions, including better harmonisation of surveys and data fusion.",

Neuroradiol.The functional imaging technique most widely used in European clinics to differentiate a true parkinsonian syndrome from vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced changes, or essential tremor is dopamine-transporter SPECT. This technique commonly reports dopamine-transporter function, with decreasing striatal uptake demonstrating increasingly severe disease. The strength of dopaminetransporter SPECT is that nigrostriatal degeneration is observed in both clinically inconclusive parkinsonism and early, even premotor, disease. In this clinical review (Part 2), we present the dopamine-transporter SPECT findings in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The findings in vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced parkinsonism, and essential tremor are also described. It is hoped that this technique will be the forerunner of a range of routinely used, process-specific ligands that can identify early degenerative disease and subsequently guide disease-modifying interventions.",

The aim of this study was to examine the trajectories of physical functioning across age groups and whether the trajectories differ according to disease status in different population subgroups. Methods: Repeat data from a nationally representative population sample, the Health and Retirement Study, was used. Participants were 10,709 men and 13,477 women aged 60-107 years at baseline with biennial surveys from 1992 to 2010. Average length of follow-up was 10.3 years ranging from 0 to 18 years. Disease status and physical functioning was asked about at all study phases and 10 items were summed to obtain a physical functioning score (0-10). Results: Age modified the relationship between number of chronic diseases and physical functioning with older participants having more physical functioning difficulties with increasing number of diseases. An average 70-year-old participant with no diseases had 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93) physical functioning difficulties, with one disease 1.72 (95% CI: 1.69-1.76) difficulties, with two diseases 2.57 (95% CI: 2.52-2.62) difficulties, and with three or more diseases 3.82 (95% CI: 3.76-3.88) difficulties. Of the individual diseases memory-related diseases, stroke, pulmonary diseases, and arthritis were associated with significantly higher physical functioning difficulties compared with other diseases. Conclusions: Comorbidity is associated with greater burden of physical functioning difficulties. Of the studied diseases, memory-related diseases, stroke, pulmonary diseases, and arthritis alone or in combination limit most physical functioning.",

It draws on detailed monitoring data from a sample of 18 classrooms from 6 London schools. Overheating during the non-heating season was identified in eight south-, south-east-, and east-facing classrooms in two Victorian and two contemporary schools. Four classrooms in these contemporary schools also failed to keep average indoor CO2 levels below 1500 ppm in the non-heating season. During the heating season, eight classrooms exceeded the daily average indoor CO2 levels. Mean indoor particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 levels recorded in all classrooms in both seasons were higher than 20 and 10 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, indicating that school exposure during an academic year may exceed annual recommended WHO [2006.

WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Selected Pollutants. Copenhagen: WHO Regional Office for Europe.] guideline values in all classrooms. In both seasons, all classrooms were found to have indoor total volatile organic compounds levels (median: 269 ppb and interquartile range: 64\u2013408 ppb) above guideline thresholds (130 ppb) associated with sensory irritations. Identification of specific volatile organic compounds indicated the presence of strong indoor sources including furniture, cleaning products, and teaching materials. Findings suggest that these school classrooms often have poor IAQ due to a combination of sub-optimal building operation and management practices. Furthermore, while CO2 and ventilation rates are a useful tool for IAQ assessment, findings indicate that consideration of specific pollutants is necessary to ensure a healthy indoor environment.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.Background: Intravenous aminoglycoside (IV AG) antibiotics, widely used in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), are known to have ototoxic complications. Despite this, audiological monitoring is not commonly performed and if performed, uses only standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA). The aim of this study was to investigate ototoxicity in CF children, to determine the most appropriate audiological tests and to identify possible risk factors. Methods: Auditory assessment was performed in CF children using standard pure tone audiometry (PTA), extended high-frequency (EHF) audiometry and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Results: 70 CF children, mean (SD) age 10.7 (3.5) years, were recruited. Of the 63 children who received IV AG, 15 (24%) children had ototoxicity detected by EHF audiometry and DPOAE. Standard PTA only detected ototoxicity in 13 children. Eleven of these children had received at least 10 courses of IV AG courses. A 25 to 85. dB. HL hearing loss (mean \u00b1 SD: 57.5 \u00b1 25.7. dB. HL) across all EHF frequencies and a significant drop in DPOAE amplitudes at frequencies 4 to 8. kHz were detected. However, standard PTA detected a significant hearing loss (>. 20. dB. HL) only at 8. kHz in 5 of these 15 children and none in 2 subjects who had significantly elevated EHF thresholds. The number of courses of IV AG received, age and lower lung function were shown to be risk factors for ototoxicity. Conclusions: CF children who had received at least 10 courses of IV AG had a higher risk of ototoxicity. EHF audiometry identified 2 more children with ototoxicity than standard PTA and depending on facilities available, should be the test of choice for detecting ototoxicity in children with CF receiving IV AG.",

Engineered skeletal muscle tissue has the potential to provide a solution that circumvents these disadvantages. Our previous work has identified a novel three-dimensionally aligned degradable phosphate glass fibre scaffold that can support myoblast differentiation and maturation. This current study has further developed the scaffold by encasing the fibres within a collagen gel to produce a smart composite scaffold that provides key biomimetic cues and supports the formation of a tissue that may be implanted in vivo. The constructs formed were approximately 30mm long and microscopic examination confirmed favourable unidirectional cell alignment. There was good cell survival, and gene expression studies demonstrated upregulation of the myogenic regulatory factors and developmental and adult myosin heavy chain isoforms indicating myofibre formation and maturation respectively. Compared with the three-dimensional glass fibre scaffolds, the composite scaffolds had later gene upregulation, however, the use of collagen gels reinforced with degradable aligned glass fibres offers the opportunity to create a tissue analogue that can be easily manipulated. Furthermore, the glass fibre ends could support tendon/bone formation, and the channels formed as the fibres degrade could allow for vascular ingrowth. Copyright",

            "Abstract": "Background Sedentary behaviours are increasingly recognised as raising the risk of cardiovascular disease events, diabetes and mortality, independently of physical activity levels. However, little is known about patterns of sedentary behaviour in older adults. Methods Cross-sectional study of 1566/3137 (50% response) men aged 71-91 years from a UK populationbased cohort study. Men wore a GT3x accelerometer over the hip for 1 week in 2010-2011. Mean daily minutes of sedentary behaviours, percentage of day in sedentary behaviours, sedentary bouts and breaks were calculated and summarised by health and demographic characteristics. Results 1403 ambulatory men aged 78.4 years (SD=4.6 years) with \u2265600 min of accelerometer wear on \u22653 days had complete data on covariables. Men spent on average 618 min (SD=83), or 72% of their day in sedentary behaviours (100 counts/min). On average, men accumulated 72 spells of sedentary behaviours per day, with 7 breaks in each sedentary hour. Men had on average 5.1 sedentary bouts of \u226530 min, which accounted for 43% of sedentary time, and 1.4 bouts of \u226560 min, which accounted for 19% of daily sedentary time. Men who were over 80 years old, obese, depressed and had multiple chronic conditions accumulated more sedentary time and spent more time in longer sedentary bouts. Conclusions Older men spend nearly three quarters of their day in sedentary behaviours, mostly accumulated in short bouts, although bouts lasting \u226530 min accounted for nearly half of the sedentary time each day. Men with medical risk factors were more likely to also display sedentary behaviour.",

            "Abstract": "Objectives There have been reports of patients with antibodies to neuronal antigens misdiagnosed as sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Conversely, low levels of antibodies to neuronal proteins have been reported in patients with sCJD. However, the frequency of misdiagnoses, or of antibodies in patients with subsequently confirmed sCJD, is not clear. Methods We reviewed 256 consecutive cases of sCJD seen in the National Prion Clinic, of whom 150 had sera previously referred for selected antibody tests. Eighty-two available samples were retested for antibodies to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the glycine receptor (GlyR), voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)-complex and the associated proteins, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2).Results Four of the initial 150 sera referred were positive; two had antibodies to NMDAR, and two to the VGKC-complex, one of which was also positive for GlyR antibodies. Of the 82 sCJD sera retested, one had VGKC-complex antibodies confirming the previous result, two had CASPR2 and GlyR antibodies and one had CASPR2 and NMDAR antibodies; all antibodies were at low levels. Over the same period three patients with autoimmune encephalitis and high VGKC-complex antibodies were initially referred as sCJD. Conclusions This study indicates that <5% patients with sCJD develop serum antibodies to these neuronal antigens and, when positive, only at low titres. By contrast, three patients referred with possible prion disease had a clinical picture in keeping with autoimmune encephalitis and very high VGKC-complex/ LGI1 antibodies. Low titres of neuronal antibodies occur only rarely in suspected patients with sCJD and when present should be interpreted with caution.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Schattauer 2015.The mechanism through which the protein kinase Akt (also called PKB), protects the heart against acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is not clear. Here, we investigate whether Akt mediates its cardioprotective effect by modulating mitochondrial morphology. Transfection of HL-1 cardiac cells with constitutively active Akt (caAkt) changed mitochondrial morphology as evidenced by an increase in the proportion of cells displaying predominantly elongated mitochondria (73 \u00b1 5.0 % caAkt vs 49 \u00b1 5.8 % control: N=80 cells/group; p< 0.05). This effect was associated with delayed time taken to induce mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening (by 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 fold; N=80 cells/group: p< 0.05); and reduced cell death following simulated IRI (32.8 \u00b1 1.2 % caAkt vs 63.8 \u00b1 5.6 % control: N=320 cells/group: p< 0.05). Similar effects on mitochondrial morphology, MPTP opening, and cell survival post-IRI, were demonstrated with pharmacological activation of Akt using the known cardioprotective cytokine, erythropoietin (EPO). The effect of Akt on inducing mitochondrial elongation was found to be dependent on the mitochondrial fusion protein, Mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), as ablation of Mfn1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) abrogated Akt-mediated mitochondrial elongation. Finally, in vivo pre-treatment with EPO reduced myocardial infarct size (as a % of the area at risk) in adult mice subjected to IRI (26.2 \u00b1 2.6 % with EPO vs 46.1 \u00b1 6.5 % in control; N=7/group: p< 0.05), and reduced the proportion of cells displaying myofibrillar disarray and mitochondrial fragmentation observed by electron microscopy in adult murine hearts subjected to ischaemia from 5.8 \u00b1 1.0 % to 2.2 \u00b1 1.0 % (N=5 hearts/group; p< 0.05). In conclusion, we found that either genetic or pharmacological activation of Akt protected the heart against acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury by modulating mitochondrial morphology.",

In this paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a trade arrival model with variable size orders and a general arrival-time distribution. With simplifications we are led in the jump-free case to a local volatility model defined by a hybrid SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric or CIR Brownian motions, whose solution in the geometric case is given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered by Nagahara, which is a type of \u2018Pearson diffusion\u2019, or, equivalently, a hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type~IV form. Under less-restrictive assumptions, richer dynamics are possible, including time-dependent Johnson-SU distributions and bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a priori been expected, so that \u201825\u03c3\u2019 events are significantly more probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market behaviors. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity. We touch briefly on the extent to which such a model is consistent with the dynamics of a \u2018flash-crash\u2019 event, and briefly explore the statistical evidence for our model.",

Echocardiography, the mainstay of current cardiac imaging, defines cardiac structure and function. Echocardiography, in conjunction with clinical phenotype, electrocardiogram and biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide and troponin), provides an assessment of the likelihood and extent of cardiac involvement. Two tests are transforming our understanding of cardiac amyloidosis, bone tracer scanning and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). CMR provides a \u201csecond opinion\u201d on the heart\u2019s structure and systolic function with better accuracy and more precision than echocardiography but is unable to assess diastolic function and is not as widely available. Where CMR adds unique advantages is in evaluating myocardial tissue characterisation. With administration of contrast, the latest type of late gadolinium enhancement imaging (phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence) is highly sensitive and specific with images virtually pathognomonic for amyloidosis. CMR is also demonstrating that the range of structural and functional changes in cardiac amyloid is broader than traditionally thought. CMR with T1 mapping, a relatively new CMR technique, can measure the amyloid burden and the myocyte response to infiltration (hypertrophy/cell loss) with advantages for tracking change (e.g. the wall thickness can stay the same but the composition can change) over time or during therapy. Such techniques hold great promise for advancing drug development in this arena and providing new prognostic insights. CMR with tissue characterisation is rewriting our understanding of cardiac amyloidosis and may lead to the development of new classification, therapies and prognostic systems.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013, RILEM.The non-destructive evaluation of the water permeability of concrete structures is a long standing challenge, principally due to the difficulty of achieving a uni-direction flow for computing the water permeability coefficient. The use of a guard ring (GR) was originally proposed for the in situ sorptivity test, but little information can be found for the water permeability test. In this study, the effect of a GR was carefully examined through the flow simulation, which was verified by carrying out experiments. It was observed that the GR can confine the flow near the surface, but cannot achieve a uni-directional flow across the whole depth of flow. To achieve a better performance, it is essential to consider the effects of the size of the inner seal and the GR and the significant interaction between these two. The analysis of the experimental data has indicated that the GR influences the flow for porous concretes, but there is no significant effect for dense concretes. Further investigation, validated using the flow-net theory, has shown a strong correlation between the water permeability coefficients obtained with the GR (Kw-GR) and without it (Kw-No GR), suggesting that one dimensional flow is not essential for interpreting data for site tests. Another practical issue was that more than 30 % of the tests with GR failed due to the difficulty of achieving a good seal between the inner and the outer chambers. Based on the work reported in this paper, a new water permeability test is proposed.",

Approval of the institutional review boards was obtained, together with written informed consent from all participants. Standardized neuropsychological assessment and conventional, diffusion tensor and volumetric brain MRI sequences were collected from 61 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 61 healthy controls (HC) from seven centers. Patients with \u22652 abnormal tests were considered cognitively impaired (CI). The distribution of focal lesions, GM and WM atrophy, and microstructural WM damage were assessed using voxel-wise approaches. A random forest analysis identified the best imaging predictors of global cognitive impairment and deficits of specific cognitive domains. Twenty-three (38%) MS patients were CI. Compared with cognitively preserved (CP), CI MS patients had GM atrophy of the left thalamus, right hippocampus and parietal regions. They also showed atrophy of several WM tracts, mainly located in posterior brain regions and widespread WM diffusivity abnormalities. WM diffusivity abnormalities in cognitive-relevant WM tracts followed by atrophy of cognitive-relevant GM regions explained global cognitive impairment. Variable patterns of NAWM and GM damage were associated with deficits in selected cognitive domains. Structural, multiparametric, voxel-wise MRI approaches are feasible in a multicenter setting. The combination of different imaging modalities is needed to assess and monitor cognitive impairment in MS.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: Many hospitalised patients are affected by medication errors (MEs) that may cause discomfort, harm and even death. Children are at especially high risk of harm as the result of MEs because such errors are potentially more hazardous to them than to adults. Until now, interventions to reduce MEs have led to only limited improvements. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing MEs and related harm in hospitalised children. Search methods: The Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the following sources for primary studies: The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Economic Evaluation Database (EED) and the Health Technology Assessments (HTA) database; MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, Web of Science (citation indexes and conference proceedings) and the EPOC Register of Studies. Related reviews were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Review authors searched grey literature sources and trial registries. They handsearched selected journals, contacted researchers in the field and scanned reference lists of relevant reviews. They conducted searches in November 2013 and November 2014. They applied neither language nor date limits. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series investigating interventions to improve medication safety in hospitalised children (\u2264 18 years). Participants were healthcare professionals authorised to prescribe, dispense or administer medications. Outcome measures included MEs, (potential) patient harm, resource utilisation and unintended consequences of the interventions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed study quality using the EPOC data collection checklist. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies and used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence. We described results narratively and presented them using GRADE tables. Main results: We included seven studies describing five different interventions: participation of a clinical pharmacist in a clinical team (n = 2), introduction of a computerised physician order entry system (n = 2), implementation of a barcode medication administration system (n = 1), use of a structured prescribing form (n = 1) and implementation of a check and control checklist in combination with feedback (n = 1). Clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies precluded meta-analyses. Although some interventions described in this review show a decrease in MEs, the results are not consistent, and none of the studies resulted in a significant reduction in patient harm. Based on the GRADE approach, the overall quality and strengfh of the evidence are low. Authors' conclusions: Current evidence on effective interventions to prevent MEs in a paediatric population in hospital is limited. Comparative studies with robust study designs are needed to investigate interventions including components that focus on specific paediatric safety issues.",

This study investigates if the bioactivity of CoCrMo can be enhanced by coating the surface with titanium oxide (TiO2) by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD), thereby replicating the surface oxide layer found on Ti. CoCrMo, TiO2-coated CoCrMo (CCMT) and Ti substrates were used for this study. Cellular f-actin distribution was shown to be noticeably different between cells on CCMT and CoCrMo after 24 h in osteogenic culture, with cells on CCMT exhibiting greater spread with developed protrusions. Osteogenic differentiation was shown to be enhanced on CCMT compared to CoCrMo, with increased calcium ion content per cell (p<0.05), greater hydroxyapatite nodule formation (p<0.05) and reduced type I collagen deposition per cell (p<0.05). The expression of the focal adhesion protein vincu-lin was shown to be marginally greater on CCMT compared to CoCrMo, whereas AFM results indicated that CCMT required more force to remove a single cell from the substrate surface compared to CoCrMo (p<0.0001). These data suggest that CVD TiO2 coatings may have the potential to increase the biocompatibility of CoCrMo implantable devices.",

MR safety must be maintained in the presence of a much wider variety of equipment than is found in a diagnostic unit, and of staff unfamiliar with the MRI environment, without compromising the safety and practicality of the interventional procedure. Both the MR-guided cardiac interventional unit at Kings College London and the intraoperative imaging suite at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery are single-room interventional facilities incorporating 1.5 T cylindrical-bore MRI scanners. The two units employ similar strategies to maintain MR safety, both in original design and day-to-day operational workflows, and between them over a decade of incident-free practice has been accumulated. This article outlines these strategies, highlighting both similarities and differences between the units, as well as some lessons learned and resulting procedural changes made in both units since installation.",

Bland-Altman plots were generated to assess the level of agreement between the two techniques.Results The three most common diagnoses were iris naevi (62 (49.2%)), iris pigment epithelial cysts (23 (18.3%)) and iris melanoma (11 (8.7%)). Image feature comparison for USB was better than AS-OCT in visualising all tumour margins (81 (64.3%) vs 59 (46.8%)), posterior tumour margin (54 (42.9%) vs 16 (12.7%)) and producing less posterior shadowing (121 (96%) vs 43 (34.1%)). Image resolution comparison revealed USB to be slightly better for resolving the overall tumour (45 (35.7%) vs 43 (34.1%)) and posterior tumour surface (70 (55.6%) vs 32 (25.4%)) but AS-OCT was better for resolving the anterior (62 (49.2%) vs 4 (3.2%)) and lateral tumour surface (62 (49.2%) vs 31 (24.6%)). Comparing the three most common diagnoses, USB was better for visualising iris pigment epithelial cysts (12 (52.2%) vs 2 (8.7%)) and iris melanoma (7 (63.6%) vs 1 (9.1%)) but AS-OCT was better (28 (45.2%) vs 15 (24.2%)) for visualising iris naevi.

Luminance and distance had significant effects on expression recognition; the effect of lamp was not significant and the effect of duration was suggested to be significant only within the escarpment region of the performance versus luminance relationship. The results were used to estimate appropriate light levels for outdoor lighting.

All rights reserved.In recent years, public engagement is increasingly viewed as more than an 'additional extra' in academia. In the UK, it is becoming more common for research projects to embrace public engagement with the belief that it informs research, enhances teaching and learning, and increases research impact on society. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to consider ways of incorporating public engagement activities into digital humanities research. This article discusses public engagement and digital humanities in practice, highlighting how museums are utilizing digital technology to engage the public. This article describes the development and presents the results of a case study: The QRator project, an application for digital interpretation in the museum and cultural heritage sector. The QRator project took an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to creating new ways for museum visitors to engage with museum objects and discussions. The objective was to understand how digital technologies, such as interactive labels and smartphones, create new ways for users to engage with museum objects; investigate the value and constraints of digital sources and methods involving cultural content; and demonstrate how crowdsourced digital interpretation may be utilized as a research source. This article will use the QRator project as a case study to explore how mobile devices and interactive digital labels can create new models for public engagement, visitor meaningmaking (Silverman, L. H. Visitor meaning-making in museums for a new age. Curator, 1995;38(3):161-70), and the construction of multiple interpretations inside museum spaces. This article will also put emphasis on how public engagement can and should be a core consideration of digital humanities projects.",

This study assessed the prevalence of reporting having stopped without reporting a quit attempt and the reasons given for this discrepancy. Methods: Data were collected from ex-smokers who said they had quit within the last 12 months during nationally representative household surveys conducted monthly between 2006-12. Results: Of the 1,892 ex-smokers who said that they had quit within the last 12 months, 13.9% (95%CI = 12.4%-15.5%) reported having made no serious quit attempts in that period. In a sub-group of 24 smokers who were asked why they had reported stopping without also reporting an attempt, nine cited inconsistency over timing; three reported stopping without attempting to do so; four did not consider it an 'attempt' because they had succeeded; and six had not ruled out the occasional cigarette in the future. Conclusions: A substantial minority of people who report having stopped in the past year may fail to report a corresponding quit attempt. However, quitting smoking without considering that one has tried appears to be rare. Instead, the most common reason for the discrepancy is inconsistent reporting of the timing of quit attempts.",

They can be obtained by dynamical networks in which a preferential attachment process takes place. However, this mechanism is non-local, in the sense that it requires knowledge of the whole graph in order for the graph to be updated. Instead, if preferential attachment and realistic networks occur in physical systems, these features need to emerge from a local model. In this paper, we propose a local model and show that a possible ingredient (which is often underrated) for obtaining scale-free networks with local rules is memory. Such a model can be realised in solid-state circuits, using non-linear passive elements with memory such as memristors, and thus can be tested experimentally.",

This underlines the importance of biomarkers to detect AD pathology in vivo before clinical disease onset.Objective: To examine the evolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker and brain structure changes in the preclinical phase of familial AD.Methods: The study included members from four Swedish families at risk for carrying an APPswe, APParc, PSEN1 H163Y, or PSEN1 I143T mutation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 13 mutation carriers (MC) and 20 non-carriers (NC) and analyzed using vertex-based analyses of cortical thickness and volume. CSF was collected from 10 MC and 12 NC from familial AD families and analyzed for A\u03b242, total tau (T-tau) and phospho-tau (P-tau).Results: The MC had significantly lower levels of CSF A\u03b242 and higher levels T-tau and P-tau than the NC. There was a trend for a decrease in A\u03b242 15-20 years before expected onset of clinical symptoms, while increasing T-tau and P-tau was not found until close to the expected clinical onset. The MC had decreased volume on MRI in the left precuneus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus.Conclusions: Aberrant biomarker levels in CSF as well as regional brain atrophy are present in preclinical familial AD, several years before the expected onset of clinical symptoms.",

There are only limited results about the theoretical underpinning of such adaptive methods: We will bridge this gap by providing a weak law of large numbers (WLLN) and a central limit theorem (CLT) for some of these algorithms. The latter seems to be the first result of its kind in the literature and provides a formal justification of algorithms used in many real data contexts [Jasra et al. (2011); Sch\u00e4fer and Chopin (2013)]. We establish that for a general class of adaptive SMC algorithms [Chopin (2002)], the asymptotic variance of the estimators from the adaptive SMC method is identical to a \"limiting\" SMC algorithm which uses ideal proposal kernels. Our results are supported by application on a complex high-dimensional posterior distribution associated with the Navier-Stokes model, where adapting highdimensional parameters of the proposal kernels is critical for the efficiency of the algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 David Hudson.The question of money, how to provide it, and how to acquire it where needed is axiomatic to development. The realities of global poverty and the inequalities between the \u2018haves\u2019 and the \u2018have-nots\u2019 are clear and well documented, and the gaps between world\u2019s richest and the world\u2019s poorest are ever-increasing. But, even though funding development is assumed to be key, the relationship between finance and development is contested and complex. This book explores the variety of relationships between finance and development, offering a broad and critical understanding of these connections and perspectives. It breaks finance down into its various aspects, with separate chapters on aid, debt, equity, microfinance and remittances. Throughout the text, finance is presented as a double-edged sword: while it is a vital tool towards poverty reduction, helping to fund development, more critical approaches remind us of the ways in which finance can hinder development. It contains a range of case studies throughout to illustrate finance in practice, including, UK aid to India, debt in Zambia, Apple\u2019s investment in China, microfinance in Mexico, government bond issues in Chile, and financial crisis in East Asia. The text develops and explores a number of themes throughout, such as the relationship between public and private sources of finance and debates about direct funding versus the allocation of credit through commercial financial markets. The book also explores finance and development interactions at various levels, from the global structure of finance through to local and everyday practices. Global Finance and Development offers a critical understanding of the nature of finance and development. This book encourages the reader to see financial processes as embedded within the broader structure of social relationships. Finance is defined and demonstrated to be money and credit, but also, crucially, the social relationships and institutions that enable the creation and distribution of credit and the consequences thereof. This valuable text is essential reading for all those concerned with poverty, inequality and development.",

Most studies concentrate on tightly connected epithelial tissues, even though collective migration does not require a constant physical contact. Movement of mesenchymal cells is more independent, making their emergent collective behaviour less intuitive and therefore lending importance to computational modelling. Here we focus on such modelling efforts that aim to understand the collective migration of neural crest cells, a mesenchymal embryonic population that migrates large distances as a group during early vertebrate development. By comparing different models of neural crest migration, we emphasize the similarity and complementary nature of these approaches and suggest a future direction for the field. The principles derived from neural crest modelling could aid understanding the collective migration of other mesenchymal cell types.",

Although there is no consensus on terminology, it is most commonly described as 'resistance to all first- and second-line drugs used to treat TB'. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) acquires drug resistance mutations in a sequential fashion under suboptimal drug pressure due to monotherapy, inadequate dosing, treatment interruptions and drug interactions. The treatment of TDR-TB includes antibiotics with disputed or minimal effectiveness against M.tb, and the fatality rate is high. Comorbidities such as diabetes and infection with human immunodeficiency virus further impact on TB treatment options and survival rates. Several new drug candidates with novel modes of action are under late-stage clinical evaluation (e.g. delamanid, bedaquiline, SQ109 and sutezolid). 'Repurposed' antibiotics have also recently been included in the treatment of extensively drug resistant TB. However, because of mutations in M.tb, drugs will not provide a cure for TB in the long term. Adjunct TB therapies, including therapeutic vaccines, vitamin supplementation and/or repurposing of drugs targeting biologically and clinically relevant molecular pathways, may achieve better clinical outcomes in combination with standard chemotherapy. Here, we review broader perspectives of drug resistance in TB and potential adjunct treatment options.",

KGaA.Most of the high efficiency kesterite solar cells are fabricated by vacuum or hydrazine-based solution methods which have drawbacks, such as high cost, high toxicity or explosivity. In our contribution, an alternative non-vacuum and environmental friendly deposition technology called electrostatic spray assisted vapour deposition (ESAVD) has been used for the cost-effective growth of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films with well controlled structure and composition. CZTS films have been characterized using a combination of XRD, XPS, SEM-EDX, AFM, and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that adherent, uniform and homogeneous CZTS films without apparent secondary phases have been produced by ESAVD. The atomic ratios measured by EDX are Cu/( Zn + Sn) = 0.88 and Zn/Sn = 1.17, which are very close with the reported high ef ficiency solar cells and can be finely tuned by formulating the precursor. CZTS films exhibited a typical optical band gap of 1.53 eV from UV-Vis analysis. Cu2ZnSnS4 produced by the ESAVD are being optimized towards the fabrication of high efficiency photovoltaic devices.",

These oligomeric compounds can be recovered to ambient pressure at T < 130 K, whereas at room temperature, they can be metastable on pressure release down to 3.5 GPa. Extensive theoretical calculations show that such oligomeric materials become thermodynamically more stable in comparison to mixtures of N2, H2, and NH3 above approximately 40 GPa.

The finding is consistent both across selected samples attending dental clinics at major competitions and more representative sampling of teams and has led to calls from the International Olympic Committee for more accurate data on oral health. Poor oral health is an important issue directly as it can cause pain, negative effects on appearance and psychosocial effects on confidence and quality of life and may have long-term consequences for treatment burden. Self-reported evidence also suggests an impact on training and performance of athletes. There are many potential challenges to the oral health of athletes including nutritional, oral dehydration, exercise-induced immune suppression, lack of awareness, negative health behaviours and lack of prioritisation. However, in theory, oral diseases are preventable by simple interventions with good evidence of efficacy. The consensus statement aims to raise awareness of the issues of oral health in elite sport and recommends strategies for prevention and health promotion in addition to future research strategies.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Background Vitamin A accumulates in renal failure, but the prevalence of hypervitaminosis A in children with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not known. Hypervitaminosis A has been associated with hypercalcemia. In this study we compared dietary vitamin A intake with serum retinoid levels and their associations with hypercalcemia. Methods We studied the relationship between vitamin A intake, serum retinoid levels, and serum calcium in 105 children with CKD stages 2-5 on dialysis and posttransplant. Serum retinoid measures included retinol (ROH), its active retinoic acid (RA) metabolites [all-trans RA (at-RA) and 13-cis RA] and carrier proteins [retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) and transthyretin (TTR)]. Dietary vitamin A intake was assessed using a food diary. Results Twenty-five children were in CKD 2-3, 35 in CKD 4-5, 23 on dialysis and 22 posttransplant; 53%had vitamin A intake above the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) value. Children receiving supplemental feeds compared with diet alone had higher vitamin A intake (p=0.02) and higher serum ROH (p<0.001). Notably, increased ROH was seen as early as CKD stage 2. For every 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), there was a 13 % increase in ROH. RBP4 levels were increased in CKD 3-5 and dialysis patients. The lowest ratios of ROH:RBP4 were seen in dialysis compared with CKD 2-3 (p=0.03), suggesting a relative increase in circulating RBP4. Serum ROH, RBP4 and at-RA were associated with serum calcium. On multivariable analysis RBP4 levels and alfacalcidol dose were significant predictors of serum calcium (model R2 32 %) in dialysis patients. Conclusions Hypervitaminosis A is seen in early CKD, with highest levels in children on supplemental feeds compared with diet alone. Serum retinoid levels significantly predict hypercalcemia.",

We initially investigated the close interplay between Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the F-actin network. We show that, during the early stage of cell adhesion, PIP2 forms domains within the filopodia membrane. We studied these domains alongside cell spreading and observed that these very closely follow the actin tread-milling. We show that this mechanism is associated with an active transport of PIP2 rich organelles from the cell perinuclear area to the edge, along actin fibers. Finally, mapping other phospholipids and membrane components we observed that the PIP2 domains formation is correlated with sphingosine and cholesterol rafts.",

As oxygen is a key substrate for Photo-/Sono-dynamic Therapy (PDT/SDT), hypoxia is also problematic for the treatment of solid tumours using these techniques. The ability to deliver oxygen to the vicinity of the tumour increases its local partial pressure improving the possibility of ROS generation in PDT/SDT. In this manuscript, we investigate the use of oxygen-loaded, lipid-stabilised microbubbles (MBs), decorated with a Rose Bengal sensitiser, for SDT-based treatment of a pancreatic cancer model (BxPc-3) in vitro and in vivo. We directly compare the effectiveness of the oxygen-loaded MBs with sulphur hexafluoride (SF<inf>6</inf>)-loaded MBs and reveal a significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy. The combination of oxygen-carrying, ultrasound-responsive MBs, with an ultrasound-responsive therapeutic sensitiser, offers the possibility of delivering and activating the MB-sensitiser conjugate at the tumour site in a non-invasive manner, providing enhanced sonodynamic activation at that site.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Cambridge University Press.Background Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is widely applied to treat severe depression resistant to standard treatment. Results from previous studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of this technique with treatment alternatives such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are conflicting. Method We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ECT alone, rTMS alone and rTMS followed by ECT when rTMS fails under the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. The analysis is based on a Markov model which simulates the costs and health outcomes of individuals treated under these alternatives over a 12-month period. Data to populate this model were extracted and synthesized from a series of randomized controlled trials and other studies that have compared these techniques on the patient group of interest. We measure effectiveness using quality-Adjusted life years (QALYs) and characterize the uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results ECT alone was found to be less costly and more effective than rTMS alone, while the strategy of providing rTMS followed by ECT when rTMS fails is the most expensive and effective option. The incremental cost per QALY gained of this latter strategy was found to be above the reference willingness-to-pay threshold used in these types of studies in Spain and other countries. The probability that ECT alone is the most cost-effective alternative was estimated to be around 70%. Conclusions ECT is likely to be the most cost-effective option in the treatment of resistant severe depression for a willingness to pay of 30 000 per QALY.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.Objectives: The aim was to assess the reliability and validity of the quality of life (QoL) instrument CASP-19, and three shorter versions of CASP-12 in large population sample of older adults from the HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol, and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe) study. Methods: From the Czech Republic, Russia, and Poland, 13,210 HAPIEE participants aged 50 or older completed the retirement questionnaire including CASP-19 at baseline. Three shorter 12-item versions were also derived from original 19-item instrument. Psychometric validation used confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, Pearson's correlation, and construct validity. Results: The second-order four-factor model of CASP-19 did not provide a good fit to the data. Two-factor CASP-12v.3 including residual covariances for negative items to account for the method effect of negative items had the best fit to the data in all countries (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05, and WRMR = 1.65 in the Czech Republic; 0.96, 0.94, 0.07, and 2.70 in Poland; and 0.93, 0.90, 0.08, and 3.04 in Russia). Goodness-of-fit indices for the two-factor structure were substantially better than second-order models. Conclusions: This large population-based study is the first validation study of CASP scale in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), which includes a general population sample in Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The results of this study have demonstrated that the CASP-12v.3 is a valid and reliable tool for assessing QoL among adults aged 50 years or older. This version of CASP is recommended for use in future studies investigating QoL in the CEE populations.",

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: To cross-culturally adapt and evaluate the psychometric properties of the oral impact on daily performance (OIDP) in Brazilians aged 50-74 years; to test the impact of oral health on 'work' and 'vigorous physical activity'. Background: Clinical oral health indicators do not assess the perceived impact of oral health on people's lives. Methods: The study was performed through small group interviews, pilot studies and a main study with 200 people aged 50 and over. Data were collected through interviews in health centres. Results: For content validity, 'eating' (1.00, p < 0.001) and 'speaking' (0.96, p < 0.001) obtained the highest level of agreement among experts. For criterion and construct validity, there was an inverse correlation between self-rated oral health, perceived oral treatment needs and satisfaction with oral health and OIDP score. Cronbach's alpha coefficient varied from 0.69 to 0.67 when 'work' and 'vigorous physical activities' were deleted. Test-retest reliability was 0.69 (ICC). Conclusion: The validation process showed that the Brazilian OIDP has the necessary basic psychometric properties to be used in the 50-74 years age group in Brazil. 'Work' and 'vigorous physical activities' had low impact on oral health. The activity 'vigorous physical activities' was not maintained in the instrument because of its low impact, while 'work' was maintained due of the increase in the 50-59 years age group in the Brazilian population.",

Both flows are driven by ambient Ricci curvature or, in the non-K\u00e4hler case, by its analogues. To this end we explore the geometry of totally real submanifolds, defining (i) a new geometric flow in terms of the ambient canonical bundle, (ii) a modified volume functional, further studied in [18], which takes into account the totally real condition. We discuss short-Time existence for our flow and show it couples well with the Streets-Tian symplectic curvature flow for almost K\u00e4hler manifolds. We also discuss possible applications to Lagrangian submanifolds and calibrated geometry.",

Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: A total of 50 eyes of 196 patients with retrievable medical records, diagnosed with AK at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, underwent keratoplasty between January 1991 and April 2012. Methods: Patient demographics, initial clinical examination findings, and management details were collected. The ophthalmic characteristics of patients who underwent keratoplasty for AK were compared with those who did not. Patients undergoing therapeutic keratoplasty were compared with those undergoing optical keratoplasty for baseline characteristics, management details, and visual outcomes. A multivariate logistic model was used to derive the odds ratios of a poor visual outcome in all keratoplasty patients. Main Outcome Measures: Poor visual outcome was defined as final visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Secondary outcomes of interest included number of clinic visits and the need for additional intraocular surgery. Results: Of the 196 AK patients, a total of 50 patients (25.5%) underwent penetrating or anterior lamellar keratoplasty, 10 of whom (20%) underwent repeat procedures. Of these 50 patients, 26 (52%) had therapeutic keratoplasty, predominantly for corneal perforation. The remaining 24 patients (48%) underwent optical keratoplasty for visual rehabilitation. Thirty-seven (80.4%) patients in the keratoplasty group initially were misdiagnosed as having herpes simplex keratitis versus 59 (41.8%) patients who did not require a keratoplasty (P < 0.001). Final visual outcomes were significantly better in the optical group compared with the therapeutic group, with 13 (54.2%) achieving visual acuity of 20/30 or better versus 7 (26.9%), respectively. On multivariate analysis, beginning therapy at a hospital other than Moorfields and undergoing a therapeutic, rather than an optical, keratoplasty were associated significantly with a poor visual outcome from keratoplasty. Conclusions: The prognosis of keratoplasty differs markedly when performed for therapeutic purposes compared with visual rehabilitation. Where possible, keratoplasty should be delayed until such time as the eye is uninflamed and medically cured of Acanthamoeba.",

The inappropriate insulin secretion drives glucose into the insulin-sensitive tissues, such as the muscle, liver and adipose tissue, leading to severe hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH). At a molecular level, genetic abnormalities in nine different genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HNF4A, HNF1A, SLC16A1, UCP2 and HADH) have been identified which cause CHI. Autosomal recessive and dominant mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 are the commonest cause of medically unresponsive CHI. Mutations in GLUD1 and HADH lead to leucine-induced HH, and these two genes encode the key enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase and short chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase which play a key role in amino acid and fatty acid regulation of insulin secretion respectively. Genetic abnormalities in HNF4A and HNF1A lead to a dual phenotype of HH in the newborn period and maturity onset-diabetes later in life. This state of the art review provides an update on the molecular basis of CHI.",

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore network-level explanations for how the form and motion information in dynamic facial expressions might be combined in the human STS. Ventral occipitotemporal areas selective for facial form were localized in occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA and FFA), and motion sensitivity was localized in the more dorsal temporal area V5. We then tested various connectivity models that modeled communication between the ventral form and dorsal motion pathways. We show that facial form information modulated transmission of motion information from V5 to the STS, and that this face-selective modulation likely originated in OFA. This finding shows that form-selective motion sensitivity in the STS can be explained in terms of modulation of gain control on information flow in the motion pathway, and provides a substantial constraint for theories of the perception of faces and biological motion.",

Child: Care, Health and Development published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd..Background: Consideration of child safeguarding is routine within maternity services but less common in other health services for adults. We audited notifications for child safeguarding from an acute general hospital where the policy includes questioning adults presenting with violence, mental health problems or drug or alcohol misuse to any department within the hospital about children at home and notifying to the local authority children's social care services if there are safeguarding concerns. Methods: Cross-sectional audit of notifications for child safeguarding, including abuse, neglect or victimization, from all departments in one hospital to the local authority children's social care department during 12 months (2010/11). Results: Of 681 notifications (57 per month), 40% (270/681) were triggered by parents' presentation to acute hospital services. Of these, 37% (100/270; 12 teenage mothers) presented for maternity care and 60% (162/270; 8 teenage parents) presented to the emergency department (ED). Of the 60% (411/681) of notifications prompted by children presenting for healthcare, most originated from the ED (358/411; 87%): two-thirds of these presented with injury (250/358; 70%). Conclusion: Given a policy to ask adults about children at home, a substantial proportion of children notified for child safeguarding were recognized through presentations to acute healthcare by their parents. Further research and development of this policy needs to ensure that questioning results in effective interventions for the children and their parents.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Swerdlow et al. Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY.Background Statins increase the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We aimed to assess whether this increase in risk is a consequence of inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the intended drug target. Methods We used single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HMGCR gene, rs17238484 (for the main analysis) and rs12916 (for a subsidiary analysis) as proxies for HMGCR inhibition by statins. We examined associations of these variants with plasma lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations; bodyweight; waist circumference; and prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes. Study-specific effect estimates per copy of each LDL-lowering allele were pooled by meta-analysis. These findings were compared with a meta-analysis of new-onset type 2 diabetes and bodyweight change data from randomised trials of statin drugs. The effects of statins in each randomised trial were assessed using meta-analysis. Findings Data were available for up to 223 463 individuals from 43 genetic studies. Each additional rs17238484-G allele was associated with a mean 0\u00b706 mmol/L (95% CI 0\u00b705-0\u00b707) lower LDL cholesterol and higher body weight (0\u00b730 kg, 0\u00b718-0\u00b743), waist circumference (0\u00b732 cm, 0\u00b716-0\u00b747), plasma insulin concentration (1\u00b762%, 0\u00b753-2\u00b772), and plasma glucose concentration (0\u00b723%, 0\u00b702-0\u00b744). The rs12916 SNP had similar effects on LDL cholesterol, bodyweight, and waist circumference. The rs17238484-G allele seemed to be associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] per allele 1\u00b702, 95% CI 1\u00b700-1\u00b705); the rs12916-T allele association was consistent (1\u00b706, 1\u00b703-1\u00b709). In 129 170 individuals in randomised trials, statins lowered LDL cholesterol by 0\u00b792 mmol/L (95% CI 0\u00b718-1\u00b767) at 1-year of follow-up, increased bodyweight by 0\u00b724 kg (95% CI 0\u00b710-0\u00b738 in all trials; 0\u00b733 kg, 95% CI 0\u00b724-0\u00b742 in placebo or standard care controlled trials and -0\u00b715 kg, 95% CI -0\u00b739 to 0\u00b708 in intensive-dose vs moderate-dose trials) at a mean of 4\u00b72 years (range 1\u00b79-6\u00b77) of follow-up, and increased the odds of new-onset type 2 diabetes (OR 1\u00b712, 95% CI 1\u00b706-1\u00b718 in all trials; 1\u00b711, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b720 in placebo or standard care controlled trials and 1\u00b712, 95% CI 1\u00b704-1\u00b722 in intensive-dose vs moderate dose trials). Interpretation The increased risk of type 2 diabetes noted with statins is at least partially explained by HMGCR inhibition. Funding The funding sources are cited at the end of the paper.",

Mutations in the gene encoding adenylate kinase 2 were identified to cause the disorder. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only option to cure this otherwise fatal disease.Retrospective data on clinical presentation, genetics, and outcome of HSCT were collected from centers in Europe, Asia, and North America for a total of 32 patients born between 1982 and 2011.Age at presentationwas <4 weeks in 30 of 32 patients (94%). Grafts originated frommismatched family donors in 17 patients (55%), frommatched family donors in 6 patients (19%), and from unrelated marrow or umbilical cord blood donors in 8 patients (26%). Thirteen patients received secondary or tertiary transplants. After transplantation, 21 of 31 patients were reported alive at a mean follow-up of 7.9 years (range: 0.6-23.6 years). All patients who died beyond 6 months after HSCT had persistent or recurrent agranulocytosis due to failure of donor myeloid engraftment. In the absence of conditioning, HSCT was ineffective to overcome agranulocytosis, and inclusion of myeloablativecomponents in theconditioningregimenswasrequiredtoachievestable lymphomyeloidengraftment. Incomparisonwith other SCID entities, considerable differences were noted regarding age at presentation, onset, and type of infectious complications, as well as the requirement of conditioning prior toHSCT.Although long-termsurvival is possible in the presence ofmixed chimerism, highlevel donor myeloid engraftment should be targeted to avoid posttransplant neutropenia.",

This problem arises because of the asymmetrical distribution of quasi-rents between two trading parties. To put this theoretical proposition to a direct test, this research first uses the Nash bargaining model to derive a hypothesis that links quasi-rent differences to the excess profit margin that the contractor can achieve in ex post negotiations, and then collates a data set of 62 change-order cases to enable the hypothesis to be tested econometrically. The corroboration of the hypothesis lends empirical support to the core argument used in the analysis of construction holdup problems. This finding brings to the foreground the significance of recognizing that change orders might be attributed to the owner's strategic choice. Ignorance of this factor would bias the coefficient estimation in the empirical analysis of change orders.",

The CL41, CL42 and CL2r50 oxidation is a complex, pH-dependent irreversible process involving the formation of electroactive products that undergo two consecutive reversible oxidation reactions. The DNA interaction with CL41, CL42 and CL2r50 was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry using the dsDNA-electrochemical biosensor and in DNA/trisubstituted triazole incubated solutions. All three trisubstituted triazole-linked phenyl derivatives interacted with dsDNA causing morphological and oxidative damage to the dsDNA structure in a time-dependent manner. The DNA-electrochemical biosensor enabled the detection of oxidative damage to DNA following the occurrence of the 8-oxoGua and/or 2,8-oxoAde oxidation peaks.",

The debate has not only focused on the vexed Council Tax issue, but on wider rural housing concerns. Questions have been raised as to whether second homes are a major cause of housing affordability problems in rural areas, and whether they lead to the displacement of local people in rural communities. In the face of anecdotal evidence being presented to answer these questions, Second Homes: European Perspectives and UK Policies, offers a more comprehensive analysis of the second homes question as it now exists.

Recent electrophysiological studies, however, indicate that eye position gain fields may serve an additional function since they have a non-uniform spatial distribution that increases the neural response to stimuli in the straight-ahead direction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a wide-field stimulus display to determine whether gaze modulations in early human visual cortex enhance the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) response to stimuli that are straight-ahead. Subjects viewed rotating polar angle wedge stimuli centered straight-ahead or vertically displaced by \u00b120\u00b0 eccentricity. Gaze position did not affect the topography of polar phase-angle maps, confirming that coding was retinotopic, but did affect the amplitude of the BOLD response, consistent with a gain field. In agreement with recent electrophysiological studies, BOLD responses in V1 and V2 to a wedge stimulus at a fixed retinal locus decreased when the wedge location in head-centered coordinates was farther from the straight-ahead direction. We conclude that stimulus-evoked BOLD signals are modulated by a systematic, non-uniform distribution of eye-position gain fields.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.In a social network, the number of links of a node, or node degree, is often assumed as a proxy for the node\u2019s importance or prominence within the network. It is known that social networks exhibit the (first-order) assortative mixing, i.e. if two nodes are connected, they tend to have similar node degrees, suggesting that people tend to mix with those of comparable prominence. In this paper, we report the second-order assortative mixing in social networks. If two nodes are connected, we measure the degree correlation between their most prominent neighbours, rather than between the two nodes themselves. We observe very strong second-order assortative mixing in social networks, often significantly stronger than the first-order assortative mixing. This suggests that if two people interact in a social network, then the importance of the most prominent person each knows is very likely to be the same. This is also true if we measure the average prominence of neighbours of the two people. This property is weaker or negative in non-social networks. We investigate a number of possible explanations for this property. However, none of them was found to provide an adequate explanation. We therefore conclude that second-order assortative mixing is a new property of social networks.",

In distributed compressive sensing (DCS), in addition to intra-signal correlation, inter-signal correlation is also exploited in the joint signal reconstruction, which goes beyond the aim of the conventional dictionary learning framework. In this letter, we propose a new dictionary learning framework in order to improve signal reconstruction performance in DCS applications. By capitalizing on the sparse common component and innovations (SCCI) model , which captures both intra- and inter-signal correlation, the proposed method iteratively finds a dictionary design that promotes various goals: i) signal representation; ii) intra-signal correlation; and iii) inter-signal correlation. Simulation results showthat our dictionary design leads to an improved DCS reconstruction performance in comparison to other designs. \u00a9 1994-2012 IEEE.",

In this paper, we develop the principle of model archaeology as a formal method to quantitatively examine the balance and evolution of energy system models, through the ex post analysis of both model inputs and outputs using a series of metrics. These metrics help us to understand how models are developed and used and are a powerful tool for effectively targeting future model improvements. The usefulness of model archaeology is demonstrated in a case study examining the UK MARKAL model. We show how model development has been influenced by the interests of the UK government and the research projects funding model development. Despite these influences, there is clear evidence of a strategy to balance model complexity and accuracy when changes are made. We identify some important long-term trends including higher technology capital costs in subsequent model versions. Finally, we discuss how model archaeology can improve the transparency of research model studies.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).This paper presents an agent-based complex system simulation of settlement structure change using methods derived from entropy maximization modeling. The approach is applied to model the movement of people and goods in urban settings to study how settlement size hierarchy develops. While entropy maximization is well known for assessing settlement structure change over different spatiotemporal settings, approaches have rarely attempted to develop and apply this methodology to understand how individual and household decisions may affect settlement size distributions. A new method developed in this paper allows individual decision-makers to chose where to settle based on social-environmental factors, evaluate settlements based on geography and relative benefits, while retaining concepts derived from entropy maximization with settlement size affected by movement ability and site attractiveness feedbacks. To demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical and methodological approach, case study settlement patterns from the Middle Bronze (MBA) and Iron Ages (IA) in the Iraqi North Jazirah Survey (NJS) are used. Results indicate clear differences in settlement factors and household choices in simulations that lead to settlement size hierarchies comparable to the two evaluated periods. Conflict and socio-political cohesion, both their presence and absence, are suggested to have major roles in affecting the observed settlement hierarchy. More broadly, the model is made applicable for different empirically based settings, while being generalized to incorporate data uncertainty, making the model useful for understanding urbanism from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.Numerous engineering applications require generation of droplets on demand which are of high uniformity and constant size. The common method to produce droplets is to drive liquid at high pressure through a small orifice/nozzle. The liquid stream disintegrates into small droplets. However this method normally requires large volumes of liquid and is not suitable for applications where single droplets of constant size is required. Such applications require droplet-on-demand generators which commonly employ piezoelectric or pneumatic actuation. It is well known that piezoelectric generators are hard to employ at high pressure and, high temperature applications, and the pneumatic generators often produce satellite (secondary) droplets. This paper describes the development of a novel percussion type droplet-on-demand generator, which overcomes some of the above difficulties and is capable of producing single droplets on demand. The generator consists of a cylindrical liquid filled chamber with a small orifice at the bottom. The top of the chamber is covered with a thin flexible metal disc. A small metal pin is employed to hammer/impact the top metal surface to generate a pressure pulse inside the liquid chamber. The movement and the momentum of the metal pin are controlled using a solenoid device. The pressure pulse generated overcomes the surface tension of the liquid meniscus at the exit of the orifice and ejects a single droplet. The work presented in this paper will demonstrate the capabilities of the droplet generator.",

It has also been linked to the autonomic control of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and cervical dystonia, which involve disturbance to the neck region, can often present with abnormalities to the oromotor, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. We investigated the potential neural pathways underlying such symptoms. Simulating neck afferent activity by electrical stimulation of the second cervical nerve in a working heart brainstem preparation (WHBP) altered the pattern of central respiratory drive and increased perfusion pressure. Tracing central targets of these sensory afferents revealed projections to the intermedius nucleus of the medulla (InM). These anterogradely labelled afferents co-localised with parvalbumin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 indicating that they are proprioceptive. Anterograde tracing from the InM identified projections to brain regions involved in respiratory, cardiovascular, postural and oro-facial behaviours\u2014the neighbouring hypoglossal nucleus, facial and motor trigeminal nuclei, parabrachial nuclei, rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla and nucleus ambiguus. In brain slices, electrical stimulation of afferent fibre tracts lateral to the cuneate nucleus monosynaptically excited InM neurones. Direct stimulation of the InM in the WHBP mimicked the response of second cervical nerve stimulation. These results provide evidence of pathways linking upper cervical sensory afferents with CNS areas involved in autonomic and oromotor control, via the InM. Disruption of these neuronal pathways could, therefore, explain the dysphagic and cardiorespiratory abnormalities which may accompany cervical dystonia and WAD.",

Aims: The current study seeks to understand what sources therapists use to inform their practice and why they are chosen. Method: Thirty-three interviews with psychological therapists in the UK were undertaken. These were transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Two superordinate themes emerged. The former focused on the nature of evidence and the latter described why certain sources were used to make clinical decisions. When discussing evidence, participants felt that research studies, specifically Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), used unrepresentative samples. Therapists felt that research other than RCTs, particularly qualitative research, was important. Therapist specific factors were felt to be as, or more, important than the technique used to treat patients. When discussing the sources they used, therapists preferred to use their clinical experience or their patients' experience to make clinical decisions. Theoretical or practical information was preferred to empirical research. The presentation of information was felt to be important to encourage the implementation of research, and therapists also felt tools such as outcome measures and manuals were too rigid to be useful. Finally, patients' choice of treatment was felt to be important in treatment decisions. Conclusions: The views of therapists were heterogeneous, but this study highlighted some of the barriers to closing the gap between science and practice. This knowledge can be used to increase the translation of science into practice.",

We develop a simple stochastic dynamic program to model how an entrepreneur should prioritize between improving processes to reduce crises versus harvesting revenue or ensuring future growth. We show that it is initially optimal to prioritize process improvement: an entrepreneur should strive for high process quality early in the venture's growth process. We numerically analyze a simple heuristic derived from this optimal policy and identify the conditions under which it is (or is not) effective. It performs near optimally except when process quality or revenue rate may deteriorate too fast or when the cost of process improvement or revenue enhancement is too high. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for the advice found in the popular entrepreneurship and time management literature to invest time now to save time later.",

Method: Data were derived from the 1970 British Cohort Study, a longitudinal observational study of 17 248 British people born in a single week of 1970. The present analyses incorporated data from the age 10 and 42-year surveys. When participants were aged 10 years, their mothers provided information on how often participants watched TV and played sports (never/ sometimes/often), and parents' own occupation, as well as height and weight. A health visitor objectively assessed participants' height and weight at age 10. Thirty-two years later, when participants were aged 42 years, they reported their daily TV viewing hours (none/0\u22641/1<3/3<5/\u22655), physical activity and health status. Associations between putative childhood and parental correlates and adult TV viewing time were investigated using logistic regression. Results: Valid data at both time points were available for 6188 participants. Logistic regression models showed that those who reported 'often' watching TV at baseline were significantly more likely to watch >3 h/days of TV at follow-up (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.65), as were those whose father was from a lower socio-occupational class (intermediate, routine/manual) compared with managerial (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.11; OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.87). Body mass index (BMI) at age 10 was inversely associated with high TV in adulthood ( per unit increase; OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.96) although fathers BMI when the child was aged 10 was positively associated with high TV in adulthood ( per unit increase; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06). Conclusions: Findings suggest that childhood TV viewing time tracks into adulthood. Parents' health behaviours and social position appear to be associated with their children's viewing habits, which may have important implications for the direction of future policy and practice. Specifically, findings support the case for early life interventions, particularly on socioeconomic inequalities, as a way of preventing sedentary behaviour in later life.",

All rights reserved.Background: The association between psychosocial work environment and employee wellbeing has repeatedly been shown. However, as environmental evaluations have typically been self-reported, the observed associations may be attributable to reporting bias. Methods: Applying instrumental-variable regression, we used staffing level (the ratio of staff to residents) as an unconfounded instrument for self-reported job demands and job strain to predict various indicators of wellbeing (perceived stress, psychological distress and sleeping problems) among 1525 registered nurses, practical nurses and nursing assistants working in elderly care wards. Results: In ordinary regression, higher self-reported job demands and job strain were associated with increased risk of perceived stress, psychological distress and sleeping problems. The effect estimates for the associations of these psychosocial factors with perceived stress and psychological distress were greater, but less precisely estimated, in an instrumental-variables analysis which took into account only the variation in self-reported job demands and job strain that was explained by staffing level. No association between psychosocial factors and sleeping problems was observed with the instrumental-variable analysis. Conclusions: These results support a causal interpretation of high self-reported job demands and job strain being risk factors for employee wellbeing.",

Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).Purpose: To assess the acceptability, validity and inter-rater agreement of self- and family carer proxy ratings of the EQ-5D as a generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measure, in people with mild to moderate dementia (PwD) living in the community. A secondary aim was to identify the most important factors influencing self- and family carer proxy ratings of HRQOL, distinguishing between spouse and adult child caregiver ratings. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 488 dyads using the EQ-5D. Inter-rater agreement was examined using weighted kappa scores, and validity by investigating the association of self- and family carer ratings with clinical variables. Factors affecting HRQOL ratings were analysed using multivariate regression. Results: The response rate of the EQ-5D was satisfactory; however, agreement between self- and family carer ratings was poor. The most important predictors of PwD and carer ratings of the PwD\u2019s HRQOL were family carer ratings of activities of daily living and mood. Anxiety experienced by the PwD was a significant predictor of self-rated HRQOL, whereas depressive symptoms independently predicted family carer ratings. The type of the caregiving relationship influenced carer ratings of HRQOL, whereby sons and daughters rated HRQOL lower for the PwD compared with spousal caregivers. Conclusions: People with mild to moderate dementia are able to rate their own HRQOL through a brief generic instrument; however, self-ratings consistently differ from family carer ratings, which should be acknowledged in cost-effectiveness analyses. Spouse caregivers rate HRQOL for the PwD more positively compared to adult children.",

A total of 23 professionals completed 307 logs, which were transcribed and analysed using Framework Analysis in Atlas.Ti. Results: Three states of implementation (apprehension, feeling clunky, and integration) and three aspects of clinician behavior or approach (effort, trust, and flexibility) were identified. Conclusions: Implementation of SDM in CAMHS requires key positive clinician behaviors, including preparedness to put in effort, trust in young people, and use of the approach flexibly. Practice implications: Implementation of SDM in CAMHS is effortful, and while tools may help support SDM, clinicians need to be allowed to use the tools flexibly to allow them to move from a state of apprehension through a sense of feeling \"clunky\" to integration in practice.",

Design: Randomized, comparative, exploratory study in a tertiary hospital setting. Participants: Patients with refractory, end-stage glaucoma. Methods: Forty-eight patients were randomized to either treatment. The intraocular pressure, visual acuity, number of medicines and repeat treatment were monitored for 18 months. Complications that include visual acuity decline, prolonged anterior chamber inflammation, phthisis bulbi, scleral thinning and ocular pain were noted. Main Outcome Measure: Intraocular pressure between 6 and 21mmHg and at least a 30% reduction with or without anti-glaucoma medications after 18 months. Results: A successful primary outcome was achieved in 75% of patients who underwent micropulse cyclophotocoagulation and 29% of patients who received continuous wave cyclophotocoagulation after 12 months (P<0.01). At 18 months, successful outcome was 52% and 30% (P=0.13), respectively. The mean intraocular pressure was reduced by 45% in both groups (P=0.70) from a baseline of 36.5mmHg and 35.0mmHg (P=0.50) after 17.5\u00b11.6 months (range 16-19) follow up. No significant difference in retreatment rates or number of intraocular pressure lowering medications was noted. The ocular complication rate was higher in continuous wave treated eyes (P=0.01). Conclusion: Diode transscleral cyclophotocoagulation in both micropulse and continuous modes was effective in lowering intraocular pressure. The micropulse mode provided a more consistent and predictable effect in lowering intraocular pressure with minimal ocular complications.",

All rights reserved.Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2-3% of the population \u226565 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. Multiple other cell types throughout the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system are also involved, probably from early disease onwards. Although clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, Parkinson disease is associated with many non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. The underlying molecular pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms: \u03b1-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Recent research into diagnostic biomarkers has taken advantage of neuroimaging in which several modalities, including PET, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and novel MRI techniques, have been shown to aid early and differential diagnosis. Treatment of Parkinson disease is anchored on pharmacological substitution of striatal dopamine, in addition to non-dopaminergic approaches to address both motor and non-motor symptoms and deep brain stimulation for those developing intractable L-DOPA-related motor complications. Experimental therapies have tried to restore striatal dopamine by gene-based and cell-based approaches, and most recently, aggregation and cellular transport of \u03b1-synuclein have become therapeutic targets. One of the greatest current challenges is to identify markers for prodromal disease stages, which would allow novel disease-modifying therapies to be started earlier.",

All rights reserved.Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of central corneal thickness (CCT) in the clinical management of a glaucoma patient. Recent findings The prognostic value of CCT is well recognized in patients with ocular hypertension. However, its predictive value in other glaucoma suspects and patients with established glaucoma is less certain. Tonometry artefacts can result from variations in CCT. However, an adequately validated correction algorithm for Goldmann applanation tonometry measurements does not exist. Newer methods of tonometry are potentially less influenced by CCT but are limited in their clinical use. There may also be biological and genetic associations between corneal thickness and glaucoma. Demographics, environmental factors, glaucoma treatment and the measurement device used have a significant influence on CCT, and should be considered when interpreting the effect of cornea thickness in patients with glaucoma. New measurements of the biomechanical properties of the cornea are likely to be better approximations of the globe biomechanics than CCT, but these require further evaluation. Summary The clinical significance of CCT is well recognized in the context of glaucoma diagnosis and management, though the extent of its importance remains debatable. Corneal biomechanical properties may be more significantly associated with glaucoma than CCT.",

Although it is concerned mainly with the archaeology of the early to mid-twentieth and twenty-first centuries, in its explicit acknowledgment of the contemporary archaeological record as multi-temporal, the subfield is not defined by a focus on a specific time period so much as a particular disposition toward time, material things, the archaeological process, and its politics. This article considers how the subfield might be characterized by its approaches to particular sources and its current and emerging thematic foci. A significant point of debate concerns the role of archaeology as a discipline through which to explore ongoing, contemporary sociomaterial practices-is archaeology purely concerned with the abandoned and the ruined, or can it also provide a means by which to engage with and illuminate ongoing, contemporary, and future sociomaterial practices?",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.The increasing use of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) has generated a significant interest in combustion-based power generation technologies, as a replacement of traditional electrochemical batteries which are plagued by low energy densities, short operational lives and low power-to-size and power-to-weight ratios. Moreover, the versatility of integrated combustion-based systems provides added scope for combined heat and power generation. This paper describes a study into the dynamics of premixed flames in a micro-channeled combustor. The details of the design and the geometry of the combustor are presented in the work by Kariuki and Balachandran [1]. This work showed that there were different modes of operation (periodic, a-periodic and stable), and that in the periodic mode the flame accelerated towards the injection manifold after entering the channels. The current study investigates these flames further. We will show that the flame enters the channel and propagates towards the injection manifold as a planar flame for a short distance, after which the flame shape and propagation is found to be chaotic in the middle section of the channel. Finally, the flame quenches when it reaches the injector slots. The glow plug position in the exhaust side ignites another flame, and the process repeats. It is found that an increase in air flow rate results in a considerable increase in the length (and associated time) over which the planar flame travels once it has entered a micro-channel, and a significant decrease in the time between its conversion into a chaotic flame and its extinction. It is well known from the literature that inside small channels the flame propagation is strongly influenced by the flow conditions and thermal management. An increase of the combustor block temperature at high flow rates has little effect on the flame lengths and times, whereas at low flow rates the time over which the planar flame front can be observed decreases and the time of existence of the chaotic flame increases. The frequency of re-ignition of successive flames decreases at higher flow rates and increases at higher temperatures. The data and results from this study will not only help the development of new micro-power generation devices, but they will also serve as a validation case for combustion models capable of predicting flame behavior in the presence of strong thermal and flow boundary layers, a situation common to many industrial applications.",

Each representation has unique advantages depending on the system of interest and the application goals. In this paper, we provide a joint framework for all three representations in the context of frequency-domain stochastic modeling. This framework allows us to extend many established statistical procedures for bivariate vector time series to complex-valued and rotary representations. These include procedures for parametrically modeling signal coherence, estimating model parameters using the Whittle likelihood, performing semiparametric modeling, and choosing between classes of nested models using model choice. We also provide a new method of testing for impropriety in complex-valued signals, which tests for noncircular or anisotropic second-order statistical structure when the signal is represented in the complex plane. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology in capturing the anisotropic structure of signals observed from fluid dynamic simulations of turbulence.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background To evaluate the use of a nonrigid registration technique for detecting acute heart transplant rejection by MRI T2 quantification. Methods Myocardial T2 quantification was achieved in 279 consecutive examinations from 78 different patients. The protocol consisted of 10 successive black-blood fast spin echo sequences with varying echo times, and a postprocessing based on image registration and exponential fitting. An automatic nonrigid registration method was applied to correct for myocardium misalignment. Finally T2 values were compared with those obtained with a conventional rigid registration followed by manual correction. Results Nonrigid registration was feasible in 98% of the datasets and was judged of higher quality compared with conventional processing (P<0.001). No significant difference was found in the clinical outcome (average septal T2) between nonrigid and conventional registration (P=0.66). Interobserver variability was improved with 95% limits of agreement of 2.7 ms (against 3.7 ms with conventional registration). The quality of T2 fitting, as assessed by the coefficient of determination R2, was significantly improved (P<0.001). Conclusion Nonrigid registration improves T2 quantification in heart-transplant patient follow-up.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2014.Context. The role of the environment in the formation of a stellar population is a difficult problem in astrophysics. The reason is that similar properties of a stellar population are found in star systems embedded in different environments or, vice versa, similar environments contain stellar systems with stellar populations having different properties. Aims. In this paper, we develop a simple analytical criterion to investigate the role of the environment on the onset of star formation. We will consider the main external agents that influence star formation (i.e. ram pressure, tidal interaction, Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities) in a spherical galaxy moving through an external environment. The theoretical framework developed here has direct applications to the cases of dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies orbiting our Milky Way system, as well as any primordial gas-rich cluster of stars orbiting within its host galaxy. Methods. We develop an analytic formalism to solve the fluid dynamics equations in a non-inertial reference frame mapped with spherical coordinates. The two-fluids instability at the interface between a stellar system and its surrounding hotter and less dense environment is related to the star formation processes through a set of differential equations. The solution presented here is quite general, allowing us to investigate most kinds of orbits allowed in a gravitationally bound system of stars in interaction with a major massive companion. Results. We present an analytical criterion to elucidate the dependence of star formation in a spherical stellar system (as a dwarf galaxy or a globular cluster) on its surrounding environment useful in theoretical interpretations of numerical results as well as observational applications. We show how spherical coordinates naturally enlighten the interpretation of two-fluids instability in a geometry that directly applies to an astrophysical case. This criterion predicts the threshold value for the onset of star formation in a mass vs. size space for any orbit of interest. Moreover, we show for the first time the theoretical dependencies of the different instability phenomena acting on a system in a fully analytical way.",

Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Neuropathological Society..Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal devastating neurodegenerative disorder which predominantly affects the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The death of the motor neurons in ALS causes subsequent muscle atrophy, paralysis and eventual death. Clinical and biological evidence now demonstrates that ALS has many similarities to prion disease in terms of disease onset, phenotype variability and progressive spread. The pathognomonic ubiquitinated inclusions deposited in the neurons and glial cells in brains and spinal cords of patients with ALS and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions contain aggregated transactive response DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43), and evidence now suggests that TDP-43 has cellular prion-like properties. The cellular mechanisms of prion protein misfolding and aggregation are thought to be responsible for the characteristics of prion disease. Therefore, there is a strong mechanistic basis for a prion-like behaviour of the TDP-43 protein being responsible for some characteristics of ALS. In this review, we compare the prion-like mechanisms of TDP-43 to the clinical and biological nature of ALS in order to investigate how this protein could be responsible for some of the characteristic properties of the disease.",

Only the morphology of the earliest members has been investigated, although other sets of data, from bone microanatomy and histology, are known to yield valuable paleobiological information. In the present study, we provide the first histological and microanatomical data on the oldest known stem-urodeles, the karaurids, from the Middle Jurassic. Three humeri from the Upper Bathonian, Oxfordshire, referred to juvenile or subadult individuals of Marmorerpeton and to an unnamed caudate of undetermined (but obviously non-larval) ontogenetic stage, were sampled in order to shed new light on the habitat and ontogeny of these basal caudates. The great compactness of the three humeri suggests that these salamanders were aquatic. The presence of extensive amounts of calcified cartilage in the humeri greatly strengthens the case for the presence of neoteny in these taxa, a suggestion that had initially been made on the basis of a few morphological characters. This constitutes the oldest known occurrence of neoteny in lissamphibians. Finally, bone histology reveals that the growth of Marmorerpeton and the related unnamed caudate was fairly slow and cyclic, a characteristic of extant lissamphibians.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: To examine patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake over three biennial invitation rounds in the National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) in England. Methods: We analysed data from the BCSP's Southern Hub for individuals (n=62 099) aged 60-64 years at the time of first invitation to screening with a follow-up period that allowed for two further biennial invitations. Data on sex, age and a neighbourhood-level measure of socioeconomic deprivation were used in the analysis. Outcomes included uptake of guaiac-based faecal occult blood (gFOB) test screening, inadequate gFOB screening (\u22651 test kit(s) returned but failed to complete further gFOB tests needed to reach a conclusive test result), test positivity, compliance with follow-up examinations (usually colonoscopy) and diagnostic outcomes. Results: Overall gFOB uptake was 57.4% in the first, 60.9% in the second and 66.2% in third biennial invitation round. This resulted in 70.1% of the initial cohort having responded at least once, 60.7% at least twice and 44.4% three times. Participation in the first round was strongly predictive of participation in the second round ('Previous Responders ': 86.6% vs 'Previous Non-Responders': 23.1%). Participation in the third round was highest among 'Consistent Screeners' (94.5%), followed by 'Late Entrants ' (78.0%), 'Dropouts' (59.8%) and 'Consistent Non-Responders' (14.6%). Socioeconomic inequalities in uptake were observed across the three rounds, but sex inequalities decreased over rounds. Inadequate gFOB screening was influenced by screening history and socioeconomic deprivation. Screening history was the only significant predictor of follow-up compliance. Conclusions: Screening history is associated with overall gFOB uptake, inadequate gFOB screening and follow-up compliance. Socioeconomic deprivation is also consistently associated with lower gFOB uptake and inadequate gFOB screening. Improving regular screening among identified 'at-risk' groups is important for the effectiveness of CRC screening programmes.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Author(s) 2015.To enable economically efficient future adaptation to water scarcity some countries are revising water management institutions such as water rights or licensing systems to more effectively protect ecosystems and their services. However, allocating more flow to the environment can mean less abstraction for economic production, or the inability to accommodate new entrants (diverters). Modern licensing arrangements should simultaneously enhance environmental flows and protect water abstractors who depend on water. Making new licensing regimes compatible with tradable water rights is an important component of water allocation reform. Regulated water markets can help decrease the societal cost of water scarcity whilst enforcing environmental and/or social protections. In this article we simulate water markets under a regime of fixed volumetric water abstraction licenses with fixed minimum flows or under a scalable water license regime (using water \"shares\") with dynamic environmental minimum flows. Shares allow adapting allocations to available water and dynamic environmental minimum flows vary as a function of ecological requirements. We investigate how a short-term spot market manifests within each licensing regime. We use a river-basin-scale hydroeconomic agent model that represents individual abstractors and can simulate a spot market under both licensing regimes. We apply this model to the Great Ouse River basin in eastern England with public water supply, agricultural, energy and industrial water-using agents. Results show the proposed shares with dynamic environmental flow licensing system protects river flows more effectively than the current static minimum flow requirements during a dry historical year, but that the total opportunity cost to water abstractors of the environmental gains is a 10-15% loss in economic benefits.",

All rights reserved.Objectives: It is still debated if pre-existing minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (MVs) affect the virological outcomes of first-line NNRTI-containing ART. Methods: This Europe-wide case-control study included ART-naive subjects infected with drug-susceptible HIV-1 as revealed by population sequencing, who achieved virological suppression on first-line ART including one NNRTI. Cases experienced virological failure and controls were subjects from the same cohort whose viraemia remained suppressed at a matched time since initiation of ART. Blinded, centralized 454 pyrosequencing with parallel bioinformatic analysis in two laboratories was used to identify MVs in the 1%-25% frequency range. ORs of virological failure according to MV detection were estimated by logistic regression. Results: Two hundred and sixty samples (76 cases and 184 controls), mostly subtype B (73.5%),were used for the analysis. Identical MVs were detected in the two laboratories. 31.6% of cases and 16.8% of controls harboured pre-existing MVs. Detection of at least one MV versus no MVs was associated with an increased risk of virological failure (OR=2.75, 95% CI=1.35-5.60, P=0.005); similar associations were observed for at least one MV versus no NRTIMVs (OR=2.27, 95% CI=0.76-6.77, P=0.140) and at least oneMV versus no NNRTIMVs (OR=2.41, 95% CI=1.12-5.18, P=0.024). A dose-effect relationship between virological failure and mutational loadwas found. Conclusions: Pre-existing MVs more than double the risk of virological failure to first-line NNRTI-based ART.",

            "Abstract": "Objectives: The use of clinical staging in the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would have value in optimising future therapeutic trials. We aimed to use previous clinical trial data to determine the length of time patients spend in each of four proposed stages, its range and transition patterns to subsequent stages. Methods: Using databases from two multicentre clinical trials, patients were retrospectively staged through the trial course. At each stage we assessed whether patients then progressed to an earlier, consecutive or later stage or death. Duration spent in each stage before progression to a later stage was calculated. Results: There were 725 patients. No patients moved to an earlier stage. More patients at stages 1, 2 and 3 progressed to the consecutive stage rather than skipping a stage. 59.3% of patients at Stage 1 progressed to Stage 2, 54.0% of patients at Stage 2 progressed to Stage 3, 42.3% of patients at Stage 3 progressed to Stage 4 and 47.0% of Stage 4 patients progressed to death. Transition times between stages had a median duration of 3 to 7 months for stages 2 to 4. Discussion: We have shown using trial data that transition times between stages are short. Use of stage duration as an endpoint might allow a shorter trial duration. We have shown face validity in this system as most patients progress through consecutive stages, and none revert to earlier stages. Furthermore, we have shown the system is reliable across populations and therefore has content validity.",

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Cambridge University Press.Background. Loss of cortical volume in frontotemporal regions occurs in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and longitudinal studies have reported progressive brain volume changes at different stages of the disease, even if cognitive deficits remain stable over time. We investigated cortical changes in patients over the 2 years following their FEP and their associations with clinical and cognitive measures. Method. Twenty-seven patients after their FEP (20 with schizophrenia, seven with schizo-affective disorder) and 25 healthy controls matched for age and gender participated in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5-T scanner both at baseline and after 2 years. Area and thickness of the cortex were measured using surface-based morphometry (SBM). Patients also underwent neuropsychological testing at these two time points. Results. Progressive cortical thinning in the superior and inferior frontal and, to a lesser extent, superior temporal cortex was observed in patients. Cortical area remained constant. Cortical thinning was associated with duration of treatment at a trend level and was predicted by baseline measures of IQ and working memory. Cortical thinning occurred in the absence of clinical or cognitive deterioration. Conclusions. The clinical implications of these cortical changes remain uncertain, but patients with less cognitive reserve may be more vulnerable to developing cortical abnormalities when exposed to medication or other disease-related biological factors.",

            "Abstract": "Background Orolingual angio-oedema is a recognised complication of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for ischaemic stroke. We investigated its incidence, clinical characteristics and relationship with other factors in patients receiving tPA at a UK centre. Methods 530 consecutive patients (median age 70 years) receiving tPA treatment for confirmed ischaemic stroke were included. Cases were defined as those developing angio-oedema within 24 h of initiation of tPA. Angio-oedema was retrospectively classified as mild, moderate or severe using predefined criteria. The primary analysis was the association between prior ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) treatment and angio-oedema. Results Orolingual angio-oedema was observed in 42 patients (7.9%; 95% CI 5.5% to 10.6%), ranging from 5 to 189 min after initiation of tPA (median 65 min). 12% of the angio-oedema cases were severe (1% of all patients treated with tPA), requiring urgent advanced airway management. 172 patients (33%) were taking ACE-I. In multifactorial analyses, only prior ACE-I treatment remained a significant independent predictor of angio-oedema (odds ratio (OR) 2.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.7). Conclusions Angio-oedema occurs more frequently than previously reported and is associated with preceding ACE-I treatment. Angio-oedema may be delayed and progress to life-threatening airway compromise, which has implications for the assessment and delivery of thrombolysis.",

It considers the political organization of society in the context of the architecture and effectiveness of emergency management systems. Ethical questions are dealt with in relation to denial of human rights, corruption, lack of regulation, and use of relief funds for \"buying\" votes. It is concluded that the ethical framework within which politics are conducted has a strong bearing on the ability to manage disaster risk. The political roots of strategies to improve resilience are examined, and the widespread lack of concern for women's issues is marked as one of the most serious political failings that need to be addressed. Global political processes of disaster reduction are surveyed critically, and finally trends and future prospects are assessed. One of these is the increasing use of the term governance to denote political processes that require transparency and a participatory approach. In this sense, we may be seeing the beginnings of a swing away from total reliance on representative democracy to a resurgence of the participatory kind.",

It focuses on initial meetings, outlining steps with the older person and creating the sorts of therapeutic relationships where people feel heard and able to talk openly. The chapter explains that older people hear the words they have used fed back or summarized to them, they feel heard and understood. Hearing their own words also makes them reassess and sometimes change what they originally said. In this way, they are taking an observer perspective to themselves and are able to reflect on and evaluate their own perhaps previously taken for granted talk. The chapter also adopts a stance of \u201ccuriosity\u201d to develop conversations, holding the view that there is not one explanation for clients\u2019 situations, but, rather, that there are a multiplicity of possible explanations and understandings.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate genetic, demographic and clinical features in patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) from the Eurofever Registry, with a focus on genotype-phenotype correlations and predictive disease severity markers. Methods: A web-based registry retrospectively collected data on patients with CAPS. Experts in the disease independently validated all cases. Patients carrying NLRP3 variants and germline-mutation-negative patients were included. Results: 136 patients were analysed. The median age at disease onset was 9 months, and the median duration of follow-up was 15 years. Skin rash, musculoskeletal involvement and fever were the most prevalent features. Neurological involvement (including severe complications) was noted in 40% and 12% of the patients, respectively, with ophthalmological involvement in 71%, and neurosensory hearing loss in 42%. 133 patients carried a heterozygous, germline mutation, and 3patients were mutation-negative (despite complete NLRP3 gene screening).Thirty-one different NLRP3 mutations were recorded; 7 accounted for 78% of the patients, whereas 24 rare variants were found in 27 cases.The latter were significantly associated with early disease onset, neurological complications (including severe complications) and severe musculoskeletal involvement. The T348M variant was associated with early disease onset, chronic course and hearing loss. Neurological involvement was less strongly associated with V198M, E311 K and A439 V alleles. Early onset was predictive of severe neurological complications and hearing loss. Conclusions: Patients carrying rare NLRP3 variants are at risk of severe CAPS; onset before the age of 6 months is associated with more severe neurological involvement and hearing loss. These findings may have an impact on treatment decisions.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 International Headache Society 2014.Background: Hemiplegic migraine (HM) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) are rare episodic neurological brain disorders with partial clinical and genetic overlap. Recently, ATP1A3 mutations were shown to account for the majority of AHC patients. In addition, a mutation in the SLC2A1 gene was reported in a patient with atypical AHC. We therefore investigated whether mutations in these genes may also be involved in HM. Furthermore, we studied the role of SLC2A1 mutations in a small set of AHC patients without ATP1A3 mutations. Methods: We screened 42 HM patients (21 familial and 21 sporadic patients) for ATP1A3 and SLC2A1 mutations. In addition, four typical AHC patients and one atypical patient with overlapping symptoms of both disorders were screened for SLC2A1 mutations. Results: A pathogenic de novo SLC2A1 mutation (p.Gly18Arg) was found in the atypical patient with overlapping symptoms of AHC and hemiplegic migraine. No mutations were found in the HM and the other AHC patients. Conclusion: Screening for a mutation in the SLC2A1 gene should be considered in patients with a complex phenotype with overlapping symptoms of hemiplegic migraine and AHC.",

EChOSim has been developed to assess the capability of the EChO mission concept to detect and characterise the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. Here we discuss the details of the EChOSim implementation and describe the models used to represent the instrument and to simulate the detection. Software simulators have assumed a central role in the design of new instrumentation and in assessing the level of systematics affecting the measurements of existing experiments. Thanks to its high modularity, EChOSim can simulate basic aspects of several existing and proposed spectrometers including instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer, ground-based and balloon-borne experiments. A discussion of different uses of EChOSim is given, including examples of simulations performed to assess the EChO mission.",

Published by Taylor & Francis.Recent calls for a revitalisation of the study of hospitality as central to anthropological theory have focussed on the material, affective, moral and cosmological aspects of hospitality. This paper argues that any such theory of hospitality should also afford consideration of how hosting practices can also be a form of medicinal experience, showing how in a Chinese hair salon these experiences ricochet into ideas of well-being by drawing on discourses and practices that are grounded in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This paper argues for an understanding of the dispersed and diffused nature of Chinese medicinal practices and concepts throughout society, while still taking into account the specificities and logics of the Chinese medical tradition. The concept of \u2018medicinal hospitality\u2019 helps to understand the social nature of these ostensibly medical treatments, and how they use the creation of distinct sensory experiences which are shared between groups of customers to generate social relations.",

In this article, a novel approach to the study of Egyptian-Levantine relations considers how food preferences, mediated by knowledge transmission and local cultural logic, provide an effective interpretive scheme for understanding the nature of relations between neighbouring societies. To this end, zooarchaeology can reveal how food preferences become enmeshed into the transformation of identity. Zooarchaeological analysis from the Early Bronze I (EB I) village of Horvat 'Illin Tahtit, Israel, finds a clear overrepresentation of cattle forelimb parts relative to hindlimb parts. The results of a correspondence analysis of faunal data from late fourth-/early third-millennium assemblages in the Levant and Egypt shows that this pattern of forelimb overrepresentation is most common in Late EB I when the intensity of Egyptian-Levantine relations peaked. I suggest that while Egyptians clearly accorded high status to cattle forelimbs, their Levantine contemporaries, who did not have materially inscribed social rankings, defined cattle forelimbs according to a cultural logic unrelated to status.",

It gives an historical overview of the changes in cities and regions and in the development of the theory and practice of planning throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. The extensively revised edition now incorporates new material on European issues, as well as updated country-specific sections and the impact of recession. Specific references are made to the most important British developments in recent times, including new towns, neo-liberalism, the devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and to cities and combined authorities, the role of infrastructure and high-speed rail, the impact of austerity, neighbourhood planning, Brexit and the continual story of the north-south divide. A chapter on United States planning discusses the continuing trends of urban dispersal and social polarisation, the treatment of climate change, the rise of edge cities and the decline of rustbelt cities, as well as initiatives in new urbanism, land use planning and transportation policies. Finally, the book looks to discuss the main issues that are likely to impact on future forms of planning in the 2020s, including digitisation, automation, sustainability and social polarisation. Urban and Regional Planning will be invaluable to undergraduate as well as postgraduate Planning students. It will prove useful in a variety of built environment areas such as Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Urban Design, Real Estate, where planning is taught.",

X-ray spectra of 49 O-stars, 54 B-stars, and 3 WR-stars are analyzed and for the brighter sources, the epoch dependence of the X-ray fluxes is investigated. The O-stars in Cyg OB2 follow a well-defined scaling relation between their X-ray and bolometric luminosities: . This relation is in excellent agreement with the one previously derived for the Carina OB1 association. Except for the brightest O-star binaries, there is no general X-ray overluminosity due to colliding winds in O-star binaries. Roughly half of the known B-stars in the surveyed field are detected, but they fail to display a clear relationship between LX and Lbol. Out of the three WR stars in Cyg OB2, probably only WR 144 is itself responsible for the observed level of X-ray emission, at a very low . The X-ray emission of the other two WR-stars (WR 145 and 146) is most probably due to their O-type companion along with a moderate contribution from a wind-wind interaction zone.",

LOG-IDEAH is an expert system which interprets the seismic damage collected on site by relying on the knowledge of engineers and architects in seismic vulnerability assessment. The present expert system has been set up on logic trees, implemented in answer set programming to encode the recognition process that surveyors proceed to investigate the causes of damage and to evaluate the failures occurring on an AA. LOG-IDEAH, available at (http://perpetuate.cs.bath.ac.uk/), allows sketching AAs, recording the state of damage, uploading GPS referenced images and comparing collapse mechanisms observed on site with collapse mechanisms identified by the system. The seismic damage, which is the minimum data required by LOG-IDEAH, is collected at the level of both structural elements and artistic assets (local level) and interpreted at the level of the AA (global level). The answer set programming applied for the construction of the machine-processable representation, once the input data has been recorded into the web-interface, provides all possible failure modes and related possibilities of occurrence by taking into consideration the reliability level of the collected data. Its capability has been validated by applying LOG-IDEAH to the historic centre of L\u2019Aquila of the 2009 earthquake by pointing out that answer set programming is a valid alternative approach to the existing methods developed to identify the seismic performance of masonry AAs.",

A few studies have suggested that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) could improve olfactory function. Our aim was to evaluate the acute effect of bilateral STN-DBS on a commonly used smell test in PD patients. Methods: Fifteen PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS and 15 controls were recruited. Patients and controls were tested for odor identification. Results: No statistical differences were documented between ON and OFF STN-DBS acute stimulation concerning olfaction. Controls presented a better performance for olfactory identification than patients. Conclusions: Our exploratory study did not support that bilateral STN-DBS could have an acute effect on olfactory function in PD patients.",

Events are selected with two high transverse momentum leptons consisting of an oppositely charged electron and muon pair. The three processes are separated using the distributions of the missing transverse momentum of events with zero and greater than zero jet multiplicities. Measurements of the fiducial cross-section are presented along with results that quantify for the first time the underlying correlations in the predicted and measured cross-sections due to proton parton distribution functions. These results indicate that the correlated next-to-leading-order predictions for tt\u00af and Z/\u03b3\u2217\u2192\u03c4\u03c4 underestimate the data, while those at next-to-next-to-leading-order generally describe the data well.

An illness-death model for history of stroke is presented, where time-dependent transition intensities are regressed on a latent variable representing cognitive function. The change of this function over time is described by a linear growth model with random effects. Occasion-specific cognitive function is measured by an item response model for longitudinal scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, a questionnaire used to screen for cognitive impairment. The illness-death model will be used to identify and to explore the relationship between occasion-specific cognitive function and stroke. Combining a multi-state model with the latent growth model defines a joint model which extends current statistical inference regarding disease progression and cognitive function. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used for Bayesian inference. Data stem from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study in the UK (1991-2005).",

This paper examines the effect of knowledge miscalibration in terms of both overconfidence (i.e., when subjective knowledge is inflated) and underconfidence (i.e., when subjective knowledge is deflated) on the dimensions of consumer value (i.e., efficiency, excellence, play, and aesthetics). The paper makes the case that overconfidence and underconfidence should be treated separately as they trigger different consumption consequences. Several hypotheses are tested through two studies: a covariance-based study (Study 1) and an experimental study (Study 2). In Study 1, overconfidence and underconfidence are measured, while in Study 2 they are experimentally manipulated. Findings of both studies show that underconfidence negatively influences efficiency, excellence, and aesthetics, and overconfidence negatively influences play. Also, Study 1 finds a negative effect of underconfidence on play and Study 2 finds a negative effect of overconfidence on excellence and aesthetics. Findings reveal that knowledge miscalibration negatively impacts consumers' usage experiences. This implies that in designing product or service experiences suppliers benefit from ensuring that consumers achieve a reduced level of knowledge miscalibration.",

This study aimed to develop a clinically relevant and scientifically robust music therapy outcome measure incorporating the values and views of people with dementia. Focus groups and interviews were conducted to obtain qualitative data on what music meant to people with dementia and the observed effects of music. Expert and peer consultations were conducted at each stage of the measure development to maximise its content validity. The new measure was field-tested by clinicians in a care home. Feedback from the clinicians and music therapy experts were incorporated during the review and refinement process of the measure. A review of the existing literature, the experiential results and the consensus process enabled the development of the new outcome measure \u201cMusic in Dementia Assessment Scales (MiDAS)\u201d. Analysis of the qualitative data identified five key areas of the impact of music on people with dementia and they were transformed as the five Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) items: levels of Interest, Response, Initiation, Involvement and Enjoyment. MiDAS comprises the five VAS items and a supplementary checklist of notable positive and negative reactions from the individual. This study demonstrates that it is possible to design and develop an easy to apply and rigorous quantitative outcome measure which has a high level of clinical relevance for people with dementia, care home staff and music therapists.",

Cell free assays and crystal structure studies demonstrate a role for APTX in resolving 5--adenylated nucleic acid breaks, however, APTX function in vertebrates remains unclear due to the lack of an appropriate model system. Here, we generated a murine model in which a pathogenic mutant of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G93A) is expressed in an Aptx-/- mouse strain. We report a delayed population doubling and accelerated senescence in Aptx-/- primary mouse fibroblasts, which is not due to detectable telomere instability or cell cycle deregulation but is associated with a reduction in transcription recovery following oxidative stress. Expression of SOD1G93A uncovers a survival defect ex vivo in cultured cells and in vivo in tissues lacking Aptx. The surviving neurons feature numerous and deep nuclear envelope invaginations, a hallmark of cellular stress. Furthermore, they possess an elevated number of high-density nuclear regions and a concomitant increase in histone H3 K9 trimethylation, hallmarks of silenced chromatin. Finally, the accelerated cellular senescence was also observed at the organismal level as shown by down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a hallmark of premature ageing. Together, this study demonstrates a protective role of Aptx in vivo and suggests that its loss results in progressive accumulation of DNA breaks in the nervous system, triggering hallmarks of premature ageing, systemically.",

The degree of multifractality displayed by different stocks is found to be positively correlated to their depth in the hierarchy of cross-correlations. We propose a dynamical model that reproduces this observation along with an array of other empirical properties. The structure of this model is such that the hierarchical structure of heterogeneous risks plays a crucial role in the time evolution of the correlation matrix, providing an interpretation to the mechanism behind the interplay between cross-correlation and multifractality in financial markets, where the degree of multifractality of stocks is associated to their hierarchical positioning in the cross-correlation structure. Empirical observations reported in this paper present a new perspective towards the merging of univariate multi scaling and multivariate cross-correlation properties of financial time series.",

However, a subject of a more practical nature kept recurring, especially on the occasions when we presented some of these findings for discussion outside the research group.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Neuropathological Society.Aims: Genetic factors do not seem to account fully for Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. There is evidence for the contribution of environmental factors, whose effect may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics involves the regulation of gene expression independently of DNA sequence and these epigenetic changes are influenced by age and environmental factors, with DNA methylation being one of the best characterized epigenetic mechanisms. The human genome is predominantly methylated on CpG motifs, which results in gene silencing; however methylation within the body of the gene may mark active transcription. There is evidence suggesting an involvement of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which prompted our study examining DNA methylation in this disorder. Methods: Using immunohistochemistry with 5-methylcytosine/5-hydroxymethylcytosine antibodies we studied, in comparison with age matched controls, DNA methylation in sporadic and familial AD cases in the entorhinal cortex that exhibits substantial pathology and the cerebellum, which is relatively spared. Results: Neuronal nuclear labelling with 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was evident in all cases studied. We did not detect any significant change in the levels of nuclear staining in the AD samples compared to neurologically normal controls. In the entorhinal cortex we also examined global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Conclusion: No significant differences were found between AD and control cases in global levels of 5mC and 5hmC in the entorhinal cortex using immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.",

The chapter intends to outline the emerging field of resource policy. A strategic approach is described considering the role of competitiveness and innovation, the influence of barriers and incentives, and the scale and scope of system innovations. A central issue for any resource policy is related to costs for purchasing materials, that is to say the access to raw materials, the compliance costs for recycling and waste as well as other cost-related issues of environmental policy. The environmental consequences of resource use are only included in market prices if there is an active internalisation policy.

Based on observations and analyses of British Sign Language narrative data, we outline criteria and recommendations for defining and annotating CA.

Case Report: 22 year Indian male with multidrug resistant spinal tuberculosis and TB meningitis was started on second line anti tuberculosis drugs. Within one month of onset of second line anti TB drug, he was noted to have optic neuropathy in both eyes. Visual field and electro diagnostics suggested optic neuropathy. Discussion: Linezolid is a synthetic oxazolidinone broad spectrum antibiotic and has been in off label use for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). There are very scattered case reports of optic neuropathy secondary to use of this off label drug. In our case, the optic neuropathy was however reversible on stoppage of the drug. Conclusion: It seems prudent that baseline ophthalmological evaluation to be done for all patients to be subjected for treatment with this drug for any short term or long term therapy.",

The limits imposed by bounded knowledge of space restrict an individual\u2019s decision-making ability, a factor that naturally influences the evolution of collective patterns of behaviour. In this paper, a new methodology for the estimation of the extents of the bounded spatial knowledge of vehicular drivers is outlined, an approach that models the relationship between road transportation activity and human cognition of space. In describing the methodology, the paper begins in outlining a topological representation of urban space that aims to capture the role of salient locations in the construction of spatial knowledge. In the second stage, a spatial interaction model is specified that estimates the relationship between home locations and nearby areas of leisure activity. In the final stage, the models of space and activity are integrated within a framework for spatial learning, enabling the estimation of the growth of spatial knowledge over time. The approach is applied to London, United Kingdom, and the spatial and temporal processes of extension in spatial knowledge are discussed. The paper concludes by outlining the potential for development and application of the model, as well as the natural limitations inherent in this approach.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies.Background: People with anxiety disorders occasionally report fears about losing control of basic bodily functions in public. These anxieties often occur in the absence of physical disorder and have previously been recognized as obsessive anxieties reflecting a preoccupation with loss of bowel/bladder control. Motivated by our observations of the non-trivial occurrence of such anxieties in our clinical practice we sought to fill a gap in the current understanding of bowel/bladder-control anxieties. Method: Eligible participants completed an internet survey. Results: Bowel/bladder-control anxieties (n = 140) tended to emerge in the mid to late 20s and were associated with high levels of avoidance and functional impairment. There was a high prevalence of panic attacks (78%); these were especially prevalent among those with bowel-control anxiety. Of those with panic attacks, 62% indicated that their main concern was being incontinent during a panic attack. Significantly, a proportion of respondents (~16%) reported actually being incontinent during a panic attack. Seventy percent of participants reported intrusive imagery related to loss of bowel/bladder control. Intrusion-related distress was correlated with agoraphobic avoidance and general role impairment. Some differences were noted between those with predominantly bowel-, predominantly bladder-and those with both bowel and bladder-control anxieties. Conclusion: This preliminary characterization indicates that even in a non-treatment seeking community sample, bowel/bladder-control anxieties are associated with high levels of distress and impairment. Further careful characterization of these anxieties will clarify their phenomenology and help us develop or modify treatment protocols in a way that takes account of any special characteristics of such viscerally-centred phobic syndromes.",

The h-version of the CIP finite element method with piecewise linear approximation is applied to a one-dimensional (1D) model problem. We first show discrete well posedness and convergence results, using the imaginary part of the stabilization operator, for the complex Helmholtz equation. Then we consider a method with real valued penalty parameter and prove an error estimate of the discrete solution in the H1-norm, as the sum of best approximation error plus a pollution term that is the order of the phase difference. It is proved that the pollution effect can be eliminated by selecting the penalty parameter appropriately. As a result of this analysis, thorough and rigorous understanding of the error behavior throughout the range of convergence is gained. Numerical results are presented that show sharpness of the error estimates and highlight some phenomena of the discrete solution behavior. In particular, we give numerical evidence that the optimal penalty parameter obtained in the 1D case also works very well for the CIP-FEM on two-dimensional Cartesian grids.\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 ESPGHAL and NASPGHAN. All rights reserved.Background: Mitochondrial liver disease (MLD), and in particular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) is an important cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in infancy. Early and accurate diagnosis is important because liver transplantation (LT) is often contraindicated. It is unclear which methods are the best to diagnose MLD in the setting of ALF. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of MLD in children younger than 2 years with ALF and the utility of routine investigations to detect MLD. Methods: Thirty-nine consecutive infants with ALF were admitted to a single unit from 2009 to 2011. All were extensively investigated using an established protocol. Genes implicated in mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome were sequenced in all cases and tissue mtDNA copy number measured where available. Results: Five infants (17%) had genetically proven MLD: DGUOK (n=2), POLG (n=2), and MPV17 (1). Four of these died, whereas 1 recovered. Two had normal muscle mtDNA copy number and 3 had normal muscle respiratory chain enzymes. An additional 8 children had low hepatic mtDNA copy number but pathogenic mutations were not detected. One of these developed fatal multisystemic disease after LT, whereas 5 who survived remain well without evidence of multisystemic disease up to 6 years later. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not distinguish between those with and without MLD. Conclusions: Low liver mtDNA copy number may be a secondary phenomenon in ALF. Screening for mtDNA maintenance gene mutations may be the most efficient way to confirm MLD in ALF in the first 2 years of life.",

This is in striking contrast to standard finite-body OT problems, in which the optimizers are typically highly correlated, as well as to infinite-body OT problems with Gangbo\u2013Swiech cost. Moreover, by adapting a construction from the study of exchangeable processes in probability theory, we prove that the corresponding N-body OT problem is well approximated by the infinite-body problem. To our class belongs the Coulomb cost which arises in many-electron quantum mechanics. The optimal cost of the Coulombic N-body OT problem as a function of the one-body marginal density is known in the physics and quantum chemistry literature under the name SCE functional, and arises naturally as the semiclassical limit of the celebrated Hohenberg-Kohn functional. Our results imply that in the inhomogeneous high-density limit (i.e. N\u2192\u221e with arbitrary fixed inhomogeneity profile \u03c1/N), the SCE functional converges to the mean field functional. We also present reformulations of the infinite-body and N-body OT problems as two-body OT problems with representability constraints.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterised by increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The functionality of four novel variants within the LDLR 5\u2032UTR and promoter located at c.-13A>G, c.-101T>C, c.-121T>C and c.-215A>G was investigated using in silico and in vitro assays, and a systemic bioinformatics analysis of all 36 reported promoter variants are presented. Bioinformatic tools predicted that all four variants occurred in sites likely to bind transcription factors and that binding was altered by the variant allele. Luciferase assay was performed for all the variants. Compared with wild type, the c.-101T>C and c.-121T>C variants showed significantly lower mean (\u00b1SD) luciferase activity (64\u00b18 and 72\u00b18%, all P<0.001), suggesting that these variants are causal of the FH phenotype. No significant effect on gene expression was seen for the c.-13A>G or c.-215A>G variants (96\u00b115 and 100\u00b112%), suggesting these variants are not FH causing. Similar results were seen for the c.-101T>C and c.-121T>C variants in lipid-depleted serum. However, a significant reduction in luciferase activity was seen in the c.-215A>G variant in lipid-depleted serum. Electrophoretic-mobility shift assays identified allele-specific binding of liver (hepatoma) nuclear proteins to c.-121T>C and suggestive differential binding to c.-101T>C but no binding to c.-215A>G. These data highlight the importance of in vitro testing of reported LDLR promoter variants to establish their role in FH. The functional assays performed suggest that the c.-101T>C and c.-121T>C variants are pathogenic, whereas c.-13A>G variant is benign, and the status of c.-215A>G remains unclear.",

Here we use a face-in-the-crowd (FITC) task which in healthy control individuals reveals prioritised threat processing, evident in faster serial search for angry compared to happy target faces. We investigate AM and BG, two individuals with bilateral amygdala lesions due to Urbach-Wiethe syndrome, and 16 control individuals. In lesion patients we show a reversal of a threat detection advantage indicating a profound impairment in prioritising threat information. This is the first direct demonstration that human amygdala lesions impair prioritisation of threatening faces, providing evidence that this structure has a causal role in responding to imminent danger.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Background: An international Delphi panel has defined a harmonized protocol (HarP) for the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on MR. The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance. Methods: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T. Results: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P <.001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P <.001). Conclusions: The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers. Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference for the qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "Modification of the number of GABAA receptors (GABA ARs) clustered at inhibitory synapses can regulate inhibitory synapse strength with important implications for information processing and nervous system plasticity and pathology. Currently, however, the mechanisms that regulate the number of GABAARs at synapses remain poorly understood. By imaging superecliptic pHluorin tagged GABAAR subunits we show that synaptic GABAAR clusters are normally stable, but that increased neuronal activity upon glutamate receptor (GluR) activation results in their rapid and reversible dispersal. This dispersal correlates with increases in the mobility of single GABAARs within the clusters as determined using single-particle tracking of GABAARs labeled with quantum dots. GluR-dependent dispersal of GABAAR clusters requires Ca2+ influx via NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and activation of the phosphatase calcineurin. Moreover, the dispersal of GABAAR clusters and increased mobility of individual GABAARs are dependent on serine 327 within the intracellular loop of the GABAAR \u03b32 subunit. Thus, NMDAR signaling, via calcineurin and a key GABAAR phosphorylation site, controls the stability of synaptic GABAARs,with important implications for activity-dependent control of synaptic inhibition and neuronal plasticity.",

The programme for care of children with congenital cardiac malformations at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is one of the largest, and most prestigious and comprehensive in the world. The Congenital Heart Institute of Florida is the largest programme providing services for patients with congenital cardiac disease in Florida. \"Heart Week in Florida\", the joint collaborative project sponsored by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia together with the Congenital Heart Institute of Florida, has now become recognized as one of the major planks of continuing medical and nursing education for those working in the fields of diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in neonates, infants, children, and young adults. In 2006, however, we broke from our previous mould, since the component of our \"week\"organized by the group from Philadelphia was organized in Phoenix, Arizona, thanks to the support provided by our colleagues working at Children's Hospital in Phoenix. It was a huge success, diminished only slightly by the inclement weather facing those who needed to journey back from sunny Arizona and Florida to the frozen and snowy northeast coast of the United States. All institutions involved with the organization of the events of 2006, nonetheless, are very grateful to Bob Anderson, and the team at Cardiology in the Young, for their support of \"Heart Week in Florida\", and for the opportunity to publish this Supplement. \u00a9 2006 Cambridge University Press.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: We sought to understand how healthcare professionals (HCP) conceptualise spirituality among seriously ill children and young people (CYP) and their families, and their experiences in dealing with spiritual issues that emerge in practice. Method: We analysed thematically presentations and small group discussions with HCP that took place as part of a day-long workshop exploring the place of spirituality in paediatric healthcare. Results: (1) HCP conceptualised spirituality as highly individualised searches for meaning, hope and connectedness to self, others and the world. They saw spirituality within a developmental context. (2) HCP described spiritual concerns that were tied to their own conceptualisations of spirituality, centring on ideas of loss, including loss of hope or meaning. (3) HCP approached spiritual concerns of CYP and families by 'being there' and supporting spiritual enquiry. (4) Challenges to their work included managing hopes of CYP and families in the face of poor prognoses, discussions about miracles and issues with their own faith. Spiritual care was seen as different to other areas of care whichHCPfelthadagreaterprescriptionindelivery. Conclusions: The findings underscore the complexity of spirituality in times of illness and the challenges faced in its management. HCP should be alerted to the myriad ways spirituality emerges in serious illness and opportunities for developing confidence in attending to spiritual issues with CYP and families through training. Research should explore with patients, families and HCP how tensions among CYP, autonomy, the maintenance of hope and miracle beliefs are best approached within care.",

High electroencephalography (EEG) frequencies, above 20 Hz, have previously been implicated in psychosis and schizophrenia. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous THC compared to placebo on high-frequency EEG. Methods: A double-blind cross-over study design was used. In the resting state, the high-beta to low-gamma magnitude (21-45 Hz) was investigated (n\u2208=\u220813 pairs\u2208+\u22084 THC only). Also, the event-related synchronisation (ERS) of motor-associated high gamma was studied using a self-paced button press task (n\u2208=\u220815). Results: In the resting state, there was a significant condition \u00d7 frequency interaction (p\u2208=\u22080.00017), consisting of a shift towards higher frequencies under THC conditions (reduced high beta [21-27 Hz] and increased low gamma [27-45 Hz]). There was also a condition \u00d7 frequency \u00d7 location interaction (p\u2208=\u22080.006), such that the reduction in 21-27-Hz magnitude tended to be more prominent in anterior regions, whilst posterior areas tended to show greater 27-45-Hz increases. This effect was correlated with positive symptoms, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (r\u2208=\u22080.429, p\u2208=\u22080.042). In the motor task, there was a main effect of THC to increase 65-130-Hz ERS (p\u2208=\u22080.035) over contra-lateral sensorimotor areas, which was driven by increased magnitude in the higher, 85-130-Hz band (p\u2208=\u22080.02) and not the 65-85-Hz band. Conclusions: The THC-induced shift to faster gamma oscillations may represent an over-activation of the cortex, possibly related to saliency misattribution in the delusional state.",

We find that the two types of prototypically aligned uses of spatial scale and enactment as described in the sign language literature (i.e. use of character scale with CA, and use of observer scale without CA) occur in both the native and nonnative signing children. We find that observer scale with CA is used by the non-native signing children but not the native signing children, and the opposite pattern with character scale without CA. These findings suggest that cognitive abilities such as perspective taking and the use of spatial scale should be considered along with linguistic abilities when looking at age of acquisition effects.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.A recurring theme of late Upper Palaeolithic Magdalenian human bone assemblages is the remarkable rarity of primary burials and the common occurrence of highly-fragmentary human remains mixed with occupation waste at many sites. One of the most extensive Magdalenian human bone assemblages comes from Gough's Cave, a sizeable limestone cave set in Cheddar Gorge (Somerset), UK. After its discovery in the 1880s, the site was developed as a show cave and largely emptied of sediment, at times with minimal archaeological supervision. Some of the last surviving remnants of sediment within the cave were excavated between 1986 and 1992. The excavations uncovered intensively-processed human bones intermingled with abundant butchered large mammal remains and a diverse range of flint, bone, antler, and ivory artefacts. New ultrafiltrated radiocarbon determinations demonstrate that the Upper Palaeolithic human remains were deposited over a very short period of time, possibly during a series of seasonal occupations, about 14,700 years BP (before present). The human remains have been the subject of several taphonomic studies, culminating in a detailed reanalysis of the cranial remains that showed they had been carefully modified to make skull-cups. Our present analysis of the postcrania has identified a far greater degree of human modification than recorded in earlier studies. We identify extensive evidence for defleshing, disarticulation, chewing, crushing of spongy bone, and the cracking of bones to extract marrow. The presence of human tooth marks on many of the postcranial bones provides incontrovertible evidence for cannibalism. In a wider context, the treatment of the human corpses and the manufacture and use of skull-cups at Gough Cave have parallels with other Magdalenian sites in central and western Europe. This suggests that cannibalism during the Magdalenian was part of a customary mortuary practice that combined intensive processing and consumption of the bodies with ritual use of skull-cups.",

Materials and Methods: Of 12 scanned infants, we successfully acquired CBF maps in 7 (postmenstrual age: 32 to 78 weeks) using a Look-Locker ASL scheme and both adult literature-derived and subject-specific model parameters. ASL global CBF measurements were compared with independent global CBF measurements obtained in the same scanning session using phase-contrast angiography. Results: Measured global CBF values ranged from 24 to 56 mL/100g/min in the scanned infants, increasing significantly with postmenstrual age (\u03c1Spearman = 0.89, P-value = 0.01). Using subject-specific model parameters yielded CBF estimates in significantly better agreement with phase-contrast angiography values (P-value: 0.80) than when standard adult parameters were used (P-value: 0.04). Conclusion: Look-Locker ASL can be used to measure CBF in infants and its accuracy is improved with the use of infant-specific auxiliary parameters, particularly blood and tissue T1, which were much more variable in the imaged infants in than adults.",

We present an interactive 3D physics engine with a wide variety of applications. In common with traditional FEM, the use of a local element stiffness matrix is retained. However, unlike typical non-linear FEM routines elements forces, moments and inertia are appropriately lumped at nodes following the dynamic relaxation method. A semi-implicit time integration scheme updates linear and angular momentum, and subsequently the local coordinate frames of the nodes. A co-rotational approach is used to compute the resultant field of displacements in global coordinates including the effect of large deformations. The results obtained compare well against established commercial software. We demonstrate that the method presented allows the making of interactive structural models that can be used in teaching to develop an intuitive understanding of structural behaviour. We also show that the same interactive physics framework allows real-time optimization that can be used for geometric and structural design applications.",

The Val<sup>158</sup>Met polymorphism affects COMT enzymatic activity and has been associated with variation in executive function and affective processing. This study investigated the effect of COMT genotype on the flexible modulation of the balance between processing self-generated and processing stimulus-oriented information, in the presence or absence of affective distractors. Analyses included 124 healthy adult participants, who were also assessed on standard working memory (WM) tasks. Relative to Val carriers, Met homozygotes made fewer errors when selecting and manipulating self-generated thoughts. This effect was partly accounted for by an association between COMT genotype and visuospatial WM performance. We also observed a complex interaction between the influence of affective distractors, COMT genotype and sex on task accuracy: male, but not female, participants showed a sensitivity to the affective distractors that was dependent on COMT genotype. This was not accounted for by WM performance. This study provides novel evidence of the role of dopaminergic genetic variation on the ability to select and manipulate self-generated thoughts. The results also suggest sexually dimorphic effects of COMT genotype on the influence of affective distractors on executive function.",

Recently, attention has focused on the role of these SNPs in determining ADS risk in European populations. To further elucidate these associations, SNPs of interest in ADH1B, ADH1C and the ADH1B/1C intergenic region were genotyped in a British and Irish population (ADS cases n = 1076: controls n = 1027) to assess their relative contribution to ADS risk. A highly significant, protective association was observed between the minor allele of rs1229984 in ADH1B and ADS risk [allelic P = 8.4 \u00d7 10-6, odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14, 0.49]. Significant associations were also observed between ADS risk and the ADH1B/1C intergenic variant, rs1789891 [allelic P = 7.2 \u00d7 10-5, OR = 1.4 (1.2, 1.6)] and three non-synonymous SNPs rs698, rs1693482 and rs283413 in ADH1C. However, these associations were not completely independent; thus, while the ADH1B rs1229984 minor allele association was independent of those of the intergenic variant rs1789891 and the three ADH1C variants, the three ADH1C variants were not individually independent. In conclusion, the rare ADH1B rs1229984 mutation provides significant protection against ADS in this British and Irish population; other variants in the ADH gene cluster also alter ADS risk, although the strong linkage disequilibrium between SNPs at this location precluded clear identification of the variant(s) driving the associations.",

Suitable donor sources of smooth muscle cells are limited and minimally invasive therapeutic approaches are sought that will augment muscle volume by delivering cells to damaged or degenerated areas of muscle. For the first time, we report the use of highly porous microcarriers produced using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) to expand and differentiate adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) into smooth muscle-like cells in a format that requires minimal manipulation before clinical delivery. AdMSCs readily attached to the surface of TIPS microcarriers and proliferated while maintained in suspension culture for 12 days. Switching the incubation medium to a differentiation medium containing 2ng/mL transforming growth factor beta-1 resulted in a significant increase in both the mRNA and protein expression of cell contractile apparatus components caldesmon, calponin, and myosin heavy chains, indicative of a smooth muscle cell-like phenotype. Growth of smooth muscle cells on the surface of the microcarriers caused no change to the integrity of the polymer microspheres making them suitable for a cell-delivery vehicle. Our results indicate that TIPS microspheres provide an ideal substrate for the expansion and differentiation of AdMSCs into smooth muscle-like cells as well as a microcarrier delivery vehicle for the attached cells ready for therapeutic applications.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.We present the first cross-correlation measurement between Sloan Digital Sky Survey type 1 quasars and the cosmic infrared background (CIB) measured by Herschel. The quasars cover the redshift range 0.15 < z < 3.5 where most of the CIB originates. We detect the submillimetre emission of the quasars, which dominates on small scales, and correlated emission from dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominant on larger scales. The mean flux of the Data Release 7 (DR7) quasars (median redshift \u3008z\u3009 = 1.4) is 11.1, 7.1 and 3.6 mJy at 250, 350 and 500 \u03bcm, respectively, while the mean flux of the DR9 quasars (\u3008z\u3009 = 2.5) is 5.7, 5.0 and 1.8 mJy at 250, 350 and 500 \u03bcm, respectively. Assuming a modified blackbody spectral energy distribution with a power law in the mid-infrared, we infer that the mean infrared luminosity of the DR7 and DR9 quasars is 10<sup>12.4</sup> and 10<sup>12.8</sup> L\u2299, respectively. The correlated emission arises from DSFGs in the same halo as the quasar (the one-halo term) and DSFGs in separate haloes correlated with the quasar-hosting halo (the two-halo term). Using a simple halo model, we find that most quasars are hosted by central galaxies. The host halo mass scale of the DR7 central and satellite quasars is 10<sup>12.4 \u00b1 0.9</sup> and 10<sup>13.6 \u00b1 0.4</sup> M\u2299, respectively. The host halo mass scale of the DR9 central and satellite quasars is 10<sup>12.3 \u00b1 0.6</sup> and 10<sup>12.8 \u00b1 0.4</sup> M\u2299, respectively. Thus, the halo environment of the central quasars is similar to that of the most actively star-forming galaxies, which supports the view that dusty starburst and quasar activity are evolutionarily linked.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize biological changes following dental extractions in patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods: Forty-five patients (36 males and 9 females) referred for dental extraction underwent treatment and provided blood samples before, immediately after, and 24 h after the procedure. A broad array of biomarkers was employed to assess myocardial injury (highly sensitive troponin T, hs-TnT), bacterial burden (LPS endotoxin activity), and systemic inflammation (CRP, fibrinogen, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1). Results: Dental extraction in patients with and without CAD was associated with rises in hs-TnT (p = 0.013), hs-CRP (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p = 0.005), endotoxin activity (p < 0.001), IFN-\u03b3 (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p = 0.011), and IL-12 (p < 0.001) at 24 h compared with immediately post procedure. Changes in systemic inflammation and endotoxin activity were more evident in those with hs-TnT rise. Conclusions: Simple dental extractions may cause mild increase in hs-TnT, indicating minor myocardial injury in both patients with and without CAD. Acute systemic inflammation and endotoxemia could represent a possible link between invasive dental treatment and increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. These findings indicate that invasive dental treatment (as simple as a single dental extraction) may impact negatively on clinical outcomes in dental patients, especially those with CAD.",

Materials and Methods In 20 healthy volunteers RAGS ( ~6 sec breath-hold) and respiratory-navigated cine ( ~5 min) PCMR were performed in both renal arteries to assess RBF. A simulation of RAGS PCMR was used to assess the effect of heart rate (30-105 bpm), vessel expandability (0-150%) and translational motion (x1.0-4.0) on the accuracy of RBF measurements. Results There was good agreement between RAGS and cine PCMR in the volunteer study (bias: 0.01 L/min, limits of agreement: -0.04 to +0.06 L/min, P = 0.0001). The simulation demonstrated a positive linear relationship between heart rate and error (r = 0.9894, P < 0.0001), a negative linear relationship between vessel expansion and error (r = -0.9484, P < 0.0001), and a nonlinear, heart rate-dependent relationship between vessel translation and error. Conclusion We have demonstrated that RAGS PCMR accurately measures RBF in vivo. However, the simulation reveals limitations in this technique at extreme heart rates (<40 bpm, >100 bpm), or when there is significant motion (vessel expandability: >80%, vessel translation: >x2.2).",

This study investigates the design and optimization of a prototype healthcare kiosk to collect vital signs measures. The design problem was decomposed, formalized, focused and used to generate multiple solutions. Systematic implementation and evaluation allowed for the optimization of measurement accuracy, first for individuals and then for a population. The optimized solution was tested independently to check the suitability of the methods, and quality of the solution. The process resulted in a reduction of measurement noise and an optimal fit, in terms of the positioning of measurement devices. This guaranteed the accuracy of the solution and provides a general methodology for similar design problems.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015, AO Research Institute. All Rights Reserved.Infection is the primary failure modality for transcutaneous implants because the skin breach provides a route for pathogens to enter the body. Intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses (ITAP) are being developed to overcome this problem by creating a seal at the skin-implant interface. Oral gingival epithelial cell attachment creates an infection-free seal around dental implants. However, this has yet to be achieved consistently outside of the oral environment. Epithelial cells attach to metal substrates by means of hemidesmosomes and focal adhesions. Their density per unit cell is an indicator of attachment strength. We postulate that gingival epithelial cells express more hemidesmosomes and focal adhesions at earlier time points, compared with epidermal keratinocytes, and this increased speed and strength of attachment may be the reason why an infection-free seal is often achieved around dental implants but less frequently around ITAP. The aim of this study was to compare epidermal keratinocyte with oral gingival cell attachment on titanium alloy in vitro, to determine whether these two cell types differ in their speed and strength of attachment. We aimed to test the hypothesis that gingival cells up-regulate focal adhesion and hemidesmosome formation at earlier time points compared with extra-oral keratinocytes. To test this hypothesis we cultured epidermal keratinocytes and oral gingival cells on titanium alloy substrates and assessed cell attachment by focal adhesions and hemidesmosome expression at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Formation and expression of hemidesmosomes temporally lagged behind that of focal adhesions in both cell types. Gingival derived cells up-regulated focal adhesion and hemidesmosome expression at earlier time points compared with epidermal keratinocytes. Hemidesmosome expression in oral gingival cells was 3 times greater compared with epidermal keratinocytes at 4 hours. Our findings indicate that earlier attachment may be key to the success of the dental implant transcutaneous interface.",

KGaA.In this article, an environmentally friendly and non-vacuum electrostatic spray assisted vapor deposition (ESAVD) process has been developed as an alternative and low cost method to deposit CIGS absorber layers. ESAVD is a non-vacuum chemical vapor deposition based process whereby a mixture of chemical precursors is atomized to form aerosol. The aerosol is charged and directed towards a heated substrate where it would undergo decomposition and chemical reaction to deposit a stable solid film onto the substrate. A sol containing copper, indium, and gallium salts, as well as thiourea was formulated into a homogeneous chemical precursor mixture for the deposition of CIGS films. After selenization, both XRD and Raman results show the presence of the characteristic peaks of CIGSSe in the fabricated thin films. From SEM images and XRF results, it can be seen that the deposited absorbers are promising for good performance solar cells. The fabricated solar cell with a typical structure of glass/Mo/CIGSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO shows efficiency of 2.82% under 100 mW cm-2 AM1.5 illumination.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Using combined datasets from ground penetrating radar (GPR) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) we document the variety of tectono-geomorphic features that contribute to the morphology of bedrock scarps associated with active extensional faulting in central Italy. Measurement of faulted offsets across such scarps can provide important fault slip-rate data relevant to seismic hazard analysis if ages can be established for offset features. However, interpretation of these offsets is challenging when geomorphic processes as well as fault slip contribute to exhumation of the bedrock during scarp development. Through the integration of surface (TLS) and subsurface (GPR) datasets, we show that the surface expression of three bedrock scarps results from the interaction between footwall incision, hangingwall sedimentation, channel incision and landsliding as well as fault slip and fault linkage. We further illustrate how these processes can be differentiated to identify locations suitable for determining fault slip-rates. The identification of such features has important implications for our understanding of the relationship between bedrock faulting and geomorphic processes, in turn contributing to improved assessment of fault slip-rates in the central Apennines. The use of combined GPR and TLS datasets here has shown that the tectono-geomorphic features of the studied scarps vary greatly over short distances and we emphasise the need for detailed scarp analysis to elucidate the processes responsible for bedrock exhumation before estimating the rates of fault slip over the timescale of scarp formation.",

There is general, but not, of course, unanimous, agreement that it is wrong to give an account of what is involved in, and essential to, our persistence over time which requires the existence of immaterial entities, but, it seems to me, there is no consensus about how, within, what might be called this naturalistic framework, we should best procede. This lack of consensus, no doubt, reflects the difficulty, which must strike anyone who has considered the issue, of achieving, just in one\u2019s own thinking, a reflective equilibrium. The theory of personal identity, I feel, provides a curious contrast. On the one side, it seems highly important to know what sort of thing we are, but, on the other, it is hard to find any answer which has a \u2018solid\u2019 feel. Animalism and an Objection There is, I think, a theory about our identity which falls within this naturalistic constraint and which can be claimed to be the simplest one to do so, and that is the thesis that we are animals of a certain kind, and so our persistence conditions are those for animals of that kind. Further, since it is the simplest theory that can be given, we have a strong motive to explore as fully as possible the resources available to it, for it is only if we are fairly sure that it cannot be right that we should move on to consider less simple views.",

Experimental results demonstrate that, with this method, electrodes for different stimulation channels located in close proximity ({<} 2 mm) can deliver current pulses simultaneously with minimum inter-channel crosstalk. The design features a memory-based scheme that manages stimulation to the three canals in parallel. A vestibular evoked potential (VEP) recording unit is included for closed-loop adaptive stimulation control. The main components of the prototype vestibular prosthesis are three ASICs, all implemented in a 0.6-\\mum high-voltage CMOS technology.

Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: To examine whether non-psychiatric hospitalizations rates were higher in those with mental disorders. Method: In a cohort of 15 811 employees, aged 35-50 years in 1989, mental disorder status was defined from 1989 to 2000. Hospitalizations for all-causes, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cancer, were recorded yearly from 2001 to 2011. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate hospitalization rates over the follow-up. Results: After controlling for baseline sociodemographic factors, health-related behaviors, self-rated health, and self-reported medical conditions, participants with a mental disorder had significantly higher rates of all-cause hospitalization [incidence rate ratio, IRR = 1.20 (95%, 1.14-1.26)], as well as hospitalization due to MI [IRR = 1.44 (95%, 1.12-1.85)]. For stroke, the IRR did not reach statistical significance [IRR = 1.37 (95%, 0.95-1.99)] and there was no association with cancer [IRR = 1.01 (95%, 0.86-1.19)]. A similar trend was observed when mental disorders groups were considered (no mental disorder, depressive disorder, mental disorders due to psychoactive substance use, other mental disorders, mixed mental disorders, and severe mental disorder). Conclusion: In this prospective cohort of employees with stable employment as well as universal access to healthcare, we found participants with mental disorders to have higher rates of non-psychiatric hospitalizations.",

Results: The home-based training intervention with opto-kinetic stimuli was feasible for people with pure ataxia, with one drop-out. Test'retest reliability is strong (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.7) for selected outcome measures evaluating balance at impairment and activity levels. Some measures reveal trends towards improvement for those in the therapy group. Sample size estimations indicate that Bal-SARA scores could detect a clinically significant change of 0.8 points in this functional balance score if 80 people per group were analysed in future trials. Conclusions: Home-based targeted training of functional balance for people with pure cerebellar ataxia is feasible and the outcome measures employed are reliable.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Springer Science+Business Media.High-pressure multi-hole injectors for direct-injection spark-ignition engines offer certain flexibility in spray directionality by selecting the number and angle of the nozzle's holes to suit the design of a particular combustion chamber. However, the spray's pattern can change significantly for injector-body temperatures representative of real engine operation at low-load conditions with injection strategies in the early intake stroke. This is due to rapid phase change effects from flash boiling of the high-volatility components of gasoline. This work presents results from an optical investigation into the effects of injector-body temperature and back pressure on the pattern of spray formation, especially when coupled to different levels of ambient turbulence. Specifically, gasoline and iso-octane fuels were tested in the range of 20-120 C injector-body temperatures and for ambient pressures of 0.5-5.0 bar. Additionally, the ambient turbulence was varied in the range 0-4 m/s to observe its effect on flash-boiling and non-flash-boiling sprays. Results from a combination of high-speed shadowgraphy and simultaneous Schlieren and Mie scattering optical techniques are presented in terms of imaged spray areas and plume penetration. Calculations of the Stokes number are also discussed with respect to turbulence and fuel properties. The results demonstrate a marginal effect of the degree of turbulence intensity on non-flash-boiling sprays that maintained their nominal plume directionality throughout the injection event. However, a significant effect on the spray's penetration and mixing at conditions of fuel flash-boiling was observed with increasing levels of turbulence intensity; the collapsed pattern of the spray's formation exhibited much faster dispersion and mixing.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.While reports showing a link between prenatal androgen exposure and human gender role behavior are consistent and the effects are robust, associations to gender identity or cross-gender identification are less clear. The aim of the current study was to investigate potential cross-gender identification in girls exposed prenatally to high concentrations of androgens due to classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Assessment included two standardized measures and a short parent interview assessing frequency of behavioral features of cross-gender identification as conceptualized in Part A of the diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder (GID) in the DSM-IV-TR. Next, because existing measures may have conflated gender role behavior with gender identity and because the distinction is potentially informative, we factor analyzed items from the measures which included both gender identity and gender role items to establish the independence of the two constructs. Participants were 43 girls and 38 boys with CAH and 41 unaffected female and 31 unaffected male relatives, aged 4- to 11-years. Girls with CAH had more cross-gender responses than female controls on all three measures of cross-gender identification as well as on a composite measure of gender identity independent of gender role behavior. Furthermore, parent report indicated that 5/39 (12.8 %) of the girls with CAH exhibited cross-gender behavior in all five behavioral domains which comprise the cross-gender identification component of GID compared to 0/105 (0.0 %) of the children in the other three groups combined. These data suggest that girls exposed to high concentrations of androgens prenatally are more likely to show cross-gender identification than girls without CAH or boys with and without CAH. Our findings suggest that prenatal androgen exposure could play a role in gender identity development in healthy children, and may be relevant to gender assignment in cases of prenatal hormone disruption, including, in particular, cases of severely virilized 46, XX CAH.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate two spinal cord (SC) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocols, implemented at multiple sites (using scanners from two different manufacturers), one available on any clinical scanner, and one using more advanced options currently available in the research setting, and to use an automated processing method for unbiased quantification. DTI parameters are sensitive to changes in the diseased SC. However, imaging the cord can be technically challenging due to various factors including its small size, patient-related and physiological motion, and field inhomogeneities. Rapid acquisition sequences such as Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) are desirable but may suffer from image distortions. We present a multi-centre comparison of two acquisition protocols implemented on scanners from two different vendors (Siemens and Philips), one using a reduced field-of-view (rFOV) EPI sequence, and one only using options available on standard clinical scanners such as outer volume suppression (OVS). Automatic analysis was performed with the Spinal Cord Toolbox for unbiased and reproducible quantification of DTI metrics in the white matter. Images acquired using the rFOV sequence appear less distorted than those acquired using OVS alone. SC DTI parameter values obtained using both sequences at all sites were consistent with previous measurements made at 3T. For the same scanner manufacturer, DTI parameter inter-site SDs were smaller for the rFOV sequence compared to the OVS sequence. The higher inter-site reproducibility (for the same manufacturer and acquisition details, i.e. ZOOM data acquired at the two Philips sites) of rFOV compared to the OVS sequence supports the idea that making research options such as rFOV more widely available would improve accuracy of measurements obtained in multi-centre clinical trials. Future multi-centre studies should also aim to match the rFOV technique and signal-to-noise ratios in all sequences from different manufacturers/sites in order to avoid any bias in measured DTI parameters and ensure similar sensitivity to pathological changes.",

A special dataset recorded in 2012 with a small number of interactions per beam crossing (below 0.004) and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 160 \u00b5b-1 was used. A minimum-bias trigger was utilised to select a data sample of more than 9 million collision events. The multiplicity, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum distributions of charged particles are shown in different regions of kinematics and chargedparticle multiplicity, including measurements of final states at high multiplicity. The results are corrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generator models which simulate the full hadronic final state.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Objective Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) are frequently measured to define body composition phenotypes. The load-capacity model integrates the effects of both FM and FFM to improve disease-risk prediction. We aimed to derive age-, gender-and BMI-specific reference curves of load-capacity model indices in an adult population (\u226518 years). Design Cross-sectional study. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure FM, FFM, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and truncal fat mass (TrFM). Two metabolic load-capacity indices were calculated: ratio of FM (kg) to FFM (kg) and ratio of TrFM (kg) to ASM (kg). Age-standardised reference curves, stratified by gender and BMI (<25\u00b70 kg/m2, 25\u00b70-29\u00b79 kg/m2, \u226530\u00b70 kg/m2), were constructed using an LMS approach. Percentiles of the reference curves were 5th, 15th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 85th and 95th. Setting Secondary analysis of data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Subjects The population included 6580 females and 6656 males. Results The unweighted proportions of obesity in males and females were 25\u00b75 % and 34\u00b77 %, respectively. The average values of both FM:FFM and TrFM:ASM were greater in female and obese subjects. Gender and BMI influenced the shape of the association of age with FM:FFM and TrFM:ASM, as a curvilinear relationship was observed in female and obese subjects. Menopause appeared to modify the steepness of the reference curves of both indices. Conclusions This is a novel risk-stratification approach integrating the effects of high adiposity and low muscle mass which may be particularly useful to identify cases of sarcopenic obesity and improve disease-risk prediction.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 .Here we present the application of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to the healthy spinal cord in vivo. NODDI provides maps such as the intra-neurite tissue volume fraction (vin), the orientation dispersion index (ODI) and the isotropic volume fraction (viso), and here we investigate their potential for spinal cord imaging. We scanned five healthy volunteers, four of whom twice, on a 3T MRI system with a ZOOM-EPI sequence. In accordance to the published NODDI protocol, multiple b-shells were acquired at cervical level and both NODDI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were obtained and analysed to: i) characterise differences in grey and white matter (GM/WM); ii) assess the scan-rescan reproducibility of NODDI; iii) investigate the relationship between NODDI and DTI; and iv) compare the quality of fit of NODDI and DTI. Our results demonstrated that: i) anatomical features can be identified in NODDI maps, such as clear contrast between GM and WM in ODI; ii) the variabilities of vin and ODI are comparable to that of DTI and are driven by biological differences between subjects for ODI, have similar contribution from measurement errors and biological variation for vin, whereas viso shows higher variability, driven by measurement errors; iii) NODDI identifies potential sources contributing to DTI indices, as in the brain; and iv) NODDI outperforms DTI in terms of quality of fit. In conclusion, this work shows that NODDI is a useful model for in vivo diffusion MRI of the spinal cord, providing metrics closely related to tissue microstructure, in line with findings in the brain.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.Objectives: The study investigated treatment outcomes when respiratory physiotherapy was delivered by non-respiratory on-call physiotherapists, compared with specialist respiratory physiotherapists. Design: Prospective, randomised crossover trial. Setting: Paediatric, tertiary care hospital in the United Kingdom. Participants: Mechanically ventilated children requiring two physiotherapy interventions during a single day were eligible. Twenty two physiotherapists (10 non-respiratory) and 93 patients were recruited. Interventions: Patients received one treatment from a non-respiratory physiotherapist and another from a respiratory physiotherapist, in a randomised order. Treatments were individualised to the patients' needs, often including re-positioning followed by manual lung inflations, chest wall vibrations and endotracheal suction. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was respiratory compliance. Secondary outcomes included adverse physiological events and clinically important respiratory changes (according to an a priori definition). Results: Treatments delivered to 63 patients were analysed. There were significant improvements to respiratory compliance (mean increase [95% confidence intervals], 0.07 and 0.08ml\u00b7cmH2O-1\u00b7kg-1 [0.01 to 0.14 and 0.04 to 0.13], p<0.01, for on-call and respiratory physiotherapists' treatments respectively). Case-by-case, there were fewer clinically important improvements following non-respiratory physiotherapists' treatments compared with the respiratory physiotherapists' (n=27 [43%] versus n=40 [63%], p=0.03). Eleven adverse events occurred, eight following non-respiratory physiotherapists' treatments. Conclusions: Significant disparities exist in treatment outcomes when patients are treated by non-respiratory on-call physiotherapists, compared with specialist respiratory physiotherapists. There is an urgent need for targeted training strategies, or alternative service delivery models, to be explored. This should aim to address the quality of respiratory physiotherapy services, both during and outside of normal working hours. Clinical Trial Registration number: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01999426.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Various factors are associated with sexual activity in adolescence and it is important to identify those that promote healthy and adaptive romantic and sexual development. The objectives of this study were to describe rates of early sexual intercourse (before 16 years) and sexual readiness in adolescence and to assess the extent to which these were social patterned. We prospectively studied nearly 5,000 15-year-olds from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK birth cohort. Between 2006 and 2008, female and male participants answered a computer assisted interview about romantic and sexual behaviors in the last year. Predictors of sexual intercourse and readiness for sexual intercourse were examined across a range of sociodemographic measures. Overall, 17.7 % (95 % CI 16.7 %, 18.9 %) of participants reported having had sexual intercourse in the last year, with more girls than boys reporting sexual experience (risk ratio 1.30, 95 % CI 1.15, 1.47). Of these, one-third of both male and female were classed as unready because they were unwilling, lacking in autonomy, felt regret or had not used contraception. There was strong evidence of social patterning for sexual activity with higher rates for young people from poorer homes, with lower social class, and with younger, less educated mothers. In contrast, among 860 young people who had had sexual intercourse, there was no clear evidence of associations between social factors and sexual readiness. The lack of social patterning in sexual readiness supports the provision of comprehensive education to develop life skills for adolescents across all social groups.",

In Europe, prevalence and incidence rates for PD are estimated at approximately 108\u2013257/100 000 and 11\u201319/100 000 per year, respectively. Risk factors include age, male gender and some environmental factors. The aetiology of the disease in most patients is unknown, but different genetic causes have been identified. Although familial forms of PD account for only 5%\u201315% of cases, studies on these families provided interesting insight on the genetics and the pathogenesis of the disease allowing the identification of genes implicated in its pathogenesis and offering critical insights into the mechanisms of disease. The cardinal motor symptoms of PD are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia/akinesia and postural instability, but the clinical picture includes other motor and non-motor symptoms. Its diagnosis is principally clinical, although specific investigations can help the differential diagnosis from other forms of parkinsonism. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and by accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein, which is found in intra-cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies. Currently available treatments offer good control of motor symptoms but do not modify the evolution of the disease. This article is intended to provide a comprehensive, general and practical review of PD for the general neurologist.",

            "DOI": "10.1136/jech-2014-204185",
            "Abstract": "Background: Mortality in Scotland is higher than in the rest of west and central Europe and is improving more slowly. Relative to England and Wales, the excess is only partially explained by area deprivation. We tested the extent to which sociodemographic, behavioural, anthropometric and biological factors explain the higher mortality in Scotland compared with England. Methods: Pooled data from 18 nationally representative cohort studies comprising the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Survey (SHS). Cox regression analysis was used to quantify the excess mortality risk in Scotland relative to England with adjustment for baseline characteristics. Results: A total of 193 873 participants with a mean of 9.6 years follow-up gave rise to 21 345 deaths. The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted all-cause mortality HR for Scottish respondents compared with English respondents was 1.40 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.47), which attenuated to 1.29 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.36) with the addition of the baseline socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics. Cause-specific mortality HRs attenuated only marginally to 1.43 (95% 1.28 to 1.60) for ischaemic heart disease, 1.37 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.63) for stroke, 1.41 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.53) for all cancers, 3.43 (95% CI 1.85 to 6.36) for illicit drug-related poisoning and 4.64 (95% CI 3.55 to 6.05) for alcohol-related mortality. The excess was greatest among young adults (16-44 years) and was observed across all occupational social classes with the greatest excess in the unskilled group. Conclusions: Only a quarter of the excess mortality among Scottish respondents could be explained by the available baseline risk factors. Greater understanding is required on the lived experience of poverty, the role of social support, and the historical, environmental, cultural and political influences on health in Scotland.",

            "Abstract": "Objectives To identify predictive parameters for the progression of skin fibrosis within 1 year in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). Methods An observational study using the EUSTAR database was performed. Inclusion criteria were dcSSc, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria fulfilled, modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) \u22657 at baseline visit, valid data for MRSS at 2nd visit, and available follow-up of 12\u00b12 months. Worsening of skin fibrosis was defined as increase in MRSS >5 points and \u226525% from baseline to 2nd visit. In the univariate analysis, patients with progressive fibrosis were compared with non-progressors, and predictive markers with p<0.2 were included in the logistic regression analysis. The prediction models were then validated in a second cohort. Results A total of 637 dcSSc patients were eligible. Univariate analyses identified joint synovitis, short disease duration (\u226415 months), short disease duration in females/patients without creatine kinase (CK) elevation, low baseline MRSS (\u226422/51), and absence of oesophageal symptoms as potential predictors for progressive skin fibrosis. In the multivariate analysis, by employing combinations of the predictors, 17 models with varying prediction success were generated, allowing cohort enrichment from 9.7% progressive patients in the whole cohort to 44.4% in the optimised enrichment cohort. Using a second validation cohort of 188 dcSSc patients, short disease duration, low baseline MRSS and joint synovitis were confirmed as independent predictors of progressive skin fibrosis within 1 year resulting in a 4.5-fold increased prediction success rate. Conclusions Our study provides novel, evidence-based criteria for the enrichment of dcSSc cohorts with patients who experience worsening of skin fibrosis which allows improved clinical trial design.",

Some of the many advantages of online mapping include the fast information dissemination to the public, the interactivity between the users and the map interface, as well as the frequent and easy database updates. However, the theme of these maps may entail privacy risks at times. Such examples include the crime mapping initiatives where crime information is considered as private and sensitive. With respect to privacy disclosure risks, this study employs a survey design to investigate the public\u2019s perception of location privacy when information about crimes is being displayed on public maps. Participants from the London Borough of Camden were recruited and their views were analysed by means of a questionnaire accompanied by mapping material (n = 201). Participants expressed a clear concern when practical implications related to the crime maps were revealed to them. Further, the majority of participants, if given the choice, would opt for a medium-risk protection method in terms of risk of privacy violation. Lastly, in regards to the impact that different visualizations may have on local crime perception the study revealed that the current police.uk cartographic technique creates the perception of more unsafe neighbourhoods than an alternative hot routes density map.",

This was the first study of selisistat in HD patients and was primarily aimed at development of pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre exploratory study. Fifty-five male and female patients in early stage HD were randomized to receive 10 mg or 100 mg of selisistat or placebo once daily for 14 days. Blood sampling, clinical and safety assessments were conducted throughout the study. Candidate pharmacodynamic markers included circulating soluble huntingtin and innate immune markers. Results Selisistat was found to be safe and well tolerated, and systemic exposure parameters showed that the average steady-state plasma concentration achieved at the 10 mg dose level (125 nm) was comparable with the IC50 for SirT1 inhibition. No adverse effects on motor, cognitive or functional readouts were recorded. While circulating levels of soluble huntingtin were not affected by selisistat in this study, the biological samples collected have allowed development of assay technology for use in future studies. No effects on innate immune markers were seen. Conclusions Selisistat was found to be safe and well tolerated in early stage HD patients at plasma concentrations within the anticipated therapeutic concentration range.",

In recent years reminiscence groups have extended to include family members, but carers\u2019 experience of attending joint sessions is undocumented. This qualitative study explored the experience of 18 family carers attending \u2018Remembering Yesterday Caring Today\u2019 groups. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: experiencing carer support; shared experience; expectations (met and unmet), carer perspectives of the person with dementia\u2019s experience; and learning and comparing. Family carers\u2019 experiences varied, with some experiencing the intervention as entirely positive whereas others had more mixed feelings. Negative aspects included the lack of respite from their relative, the lack of emphasis on their own needs, and experiencing additional stress and guilt through not being able to implement newly acquired skills. These findings may explain the failure of a recent trial of joint reminiscence groups to replicate previous findings of positive benefit. More targeted research within subgroups of carers is required to justify the continued use of joint reminiscence groups in dementia care.",

Sensitivities are explored for CP violation in neutrinos, non-maximal sin2 2\u039823, the octant of \u039823, and the mass hierarchy, in addition to the measurements of \u03b4CP, sin2 \u039823, and \u0394m2 32, for various combinations of \u03bd-mode and \u03bd-mode data-taking. With an exposure of 7.8 \u00d7 1021 protons-on-target, T2K can achieve 1 \u03c3 resolution of 0.050 (0.054) on sin2 \u039823 and 0.040 (0.045) \u00d7 10-3 eV2 on \u0394m2 32 for 100% (50%) neutrino beam mode running assuming sin2 \u039823 = 0.5 and \u0394m2 32 = 2.4 \u00d7 10-3 eV2. T2K will have sensitivity to the CP-violating phase \u03b4CP at 90% C.L. or better over a significant range. For example, if sin2 2\u039823 is maximal (i.e. \u039823 = 45\u00b0) the range is -115\u00b0 < \u03b4CP < -60\u00b0 for normal hierarchy and +50\u00b0 < \u03b4CP < +130\u00b0 for inverted hierarchy. When T2K data is combined with data from the NO\u03bdA experiment, the region of oscillation parameter space where there is sensitivity to observe a non-zero \u03b4CP is substantially increased compared to if each experiment is analyzed alone.",

I argue that these buildings, associated with the settling of postcolonial migrants are often contested sites strongly opposed by the settled population. Mosques, in particular, are often challenged. Migrant religious buildings are opposed by those because of fears about noise or parking or on the groups that their architectural forms are unfamiliar and unsuitable within existing townscapes and planning regimes. The established settlement of migrant religious groups in the UK is now producing more imposing religious buildings. Such buildings, like the Swaminaryan Hindu temple in Neasden, London, are often ambitious recreations of traditional buildings. But there are also new architectural forms emerging which represent creative responses to both the local environment and the migrant experience. The Salaam Centre, constructed for a Shia Ithna\u2019\u2122ashari Muslim community which originated from East Africa is envisaged not as a mosque, but as a shared community religious space. Its innovative design incorporates influences from Islamic heritage with modern design drawing particularly on ideas about light and space. Woven into the fa\u00c3ade are patterns which connect the migratory journeys of the Shia Ithna\u2019\u2122ahsaris from Persia, India and Tanzania with the suburban vernacular landscape of northwest London. The Centre emerges as an important intervention in our understanding of suburban architectures and transnational religious landscapes in the imagination of a new form of suburban religious space.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.Abstract The immune system influences brain development and function. Hygiene and other early childhood influences impact the subsequent function of the immune system during adulthood, with consequences for vulnerability to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Inflammatory events during pregnancy can act directly to cause developmental problems in the central nervous system (CNS) that have been implicated in schizophrenia and autism. The immune system also acts indirectly by \"farming\" the intestinal microbiota, which then influences brain development and function via the multiple pathways that constitute the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota also regulates the immune system. Regulation of the immune system is crucial because inflammatory states in pregnancy need to be limited, and throughout life inflammation needs to be terminated completely when not required; for example, persistently raised levels of background inflammation during adulthood (in the presence or absence of a clinically apparent inflammatory stimulus) correlate with an increased risk of depression. A number of factors in the perinatal period, notably immigration from rural low-income to rich developed settings, caesarean delivery, breastfeeding and antibiotic abuse have profound effects on the microbiota and on immunoregulation during early life that persist into adulthood. Many aspects of the modern western environment deprive the infant of the immunoregulatory organisms with which humans co-evolved, while encouraging exposure to non-immunoregulatory organisms, associated with more recently evolved \"crowd\" infections. Finally, there are complex interactions between perinatal psychosocial stressors, the microbiota, and the immune system that have significant additional effects on both physical and psychiatric wellbeing in subsequent adulthood.

Although this signature has the topology of neutrino quasielastic scattering from neutrons, the event sample contains contributions from quasielastic and inelastic processes where pions are absorbed in the nucleus. The analysis accepts events with muon production angles up to 70\u00b0 and proton kinetic energies greater than 110 MeV. The cross section, when based completely on hadronic kinematics, is well described by a relativistic Fermi gas nuclear model including the neutrino event generator modeling for inelastic processes and particle transportation through the nucleus. This is in contrast to the quasielastic cross section based on muon kinematics, which is best described by an extended model that incorporates multinucleon correlations. This measurement guides the formulation of a complete description of neutrino-nucleus interactions that encompasses the hadronic as well as the leptonic aspects of this process.",

Using as a case study the Huichol community of North-Western Mexico we will discuss how institutional health and welfare programmes which aim to address accepted risk factors for maternal health are undermined by a series of structural barriers which put indigenous women especially in harm's way. Semi-structured interviews and observational data were gathered between 2009 and 2011 in highland communities and on coastal tobacco plantations to where a large number of this ethnic group migrate. Many Huichol women birth alone, and to facilitate this process they maintain a low nutritional intake to reduce their infant's growth and seek spiritual guidance during pregnancy from a shaman. These practices are reinforced by feelings of shame and humiliation encountered when using institutional health provision. These are some of the structural barriers to care that need to be addressed. Effective interventions could include addressing the training of health professionals, focusing on educational inequalities and the structural determinants of poverty whilst designing locally specific programmes that encourage acceptance of available health care.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.Rationale A dimensional approach in psychiatry aims to identify core mechanisms of mental disorders across nosological boundaries. Objectives We compared anticipation of reward between major psychiatric disorders, and investigated whether reward anticipation is impaired in several mental disorders and whether there is a common psychopathological correlate (negative mood) of such an impairment. Methods We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a monetary incentive delay (MID) task to study the functional correlates of reward anticipation across major psychiatric disorders in 184 subjects, with the diagnoses of alcohol dependence (n=26), schizophrenia (n=44), major depressive disorder (MDD, n=24), bipolar disorder (acute manic episode, n=13), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n=23), and healthy controls (n=54). Subjects' individual Beck Depression Inventory-and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-scores were correlated with clusters showing significant activation during reward anticipation. Results During reward anticipation, we observed significant group differences in ventral striatal (VS) activation: patients with schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, and major depression showed significantly less ventral striatal activation compared to healthy controls. Depressive symptoms correlated with dysfunction in reward anticipation regardless of diagnostic entity. There was no significant correlation between anxiety symptoms and VS functional activation. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a neurobiological dysfunction related to reward prediction that transcended disorder categories and was related to measures of depressed mood. The findings underline the potential of a dimensional approach in psychiatry and strengthen the hypothesis that neu-robiological research in psychiatric disorders can be targeted at core mechanisms that are likely to be implicated in a range of clinical entities.",

All rights reserved.Background: Public health (PH) policymakers are encouraged to use evidence in the decision-making process. However, little is known about what types of evidence policymakers working in local settings prefer to use. This study aims to evaluate policymakers' needs and sources of information, at regional and local levels. An electronic survey with telephone follow-up was carried out among PH policymakers and evidence producers ( n = 152) working in a large UK city. Respondents were asked which types of evidence they used regularly, found most useful and what were their main sources of information. Semi-structured interviews ( n = 23) added were analysed quantitatively in addition to the categorical data generated by the survey. Policymakers use a much greater range of evidence and information than is often indicated in the literature on evidence-based policy. Local data were by far the most used ( n = 95%) and most valued ( n = 85%) type of information, followed by practice guidelines. The main sources of information were Government websites (84%), followed by information obtained through personal contacts (71%), including PH professionals, council officers and politicians. Academics were rarely consulted and research evidence was rarely seen as directly relevant. Conclusions: Policymakers use a wider range of evidence types than previously discussed in the literature. Although local data were most valued by policymakers, results suggest that these were accessed through personal contacts, rather than specialized organizations. Systems to provide local high-quality evidence for PH policy should be supported.",

We show that this variation is constrained and that some of these mechanisms can be blocked and/or forced depending on the properties of the conjuncts. Finally, we offer the suggestion that the presence of intraindividual variation arises because of ambiguous properties of the primary linguistic data.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 Joshua J. W. Paulin et al.The laying down of memory requires strong stimulation resulting in specific changes in synaptic strength and corresponding changes in size of dendritic spines. Strong stimuli can also be pathological, causing a homeostatic response, depressing and shrinking the synapse to prevent damage from too much Ca2+ influx. But do all types of dendritic spines serve both of these apparently opposite functions? Using confocal microscopy in organotypic slices from mice expressing green fluorescent protein in hippocampal neurones, the size of individual spines along sections of dendrite has been tracked in response to application of tetraethylammonium. This strong stimulus would be expected to cause both a protective homeostatic response and long-term potentiation. We report separation of these functions, with spines of different sizes reacting differently to the same strong stimulus. The immediate shrinkage of large spines suggests a homeostatic protective response during the period of potential danger. In CA1, long-lasting growth of small spines subsequently occurs consolidating long-term potentiation but only after the large spines return to their original size. In contrast, small spines do not change in dentate gyrus where potentiation does not occur. The separation in time of these changes allows clear functional differentiation of spines of different sizes.",

In the earlier work [14], it was shown that a metric in a fixed conformal class is uniquely determined by boundary measurements under two conditions: (1) the metric is conformally transversally anisotropic (CTA), and (2) the transversal manifold is simple. In this paper we will consider geometries satisfying (1) but not (2). The first main result states that the boundary measurements uniquely determine a mixed Fourier transform/attenuated geodesic ray transform (or integral against a more general semiclassical limit measure) of an unknown coefficient. In particular, one obtains uniqueness results whenever the geodesic ray transform on the transversal manifold is injective. The second result shows that the boundary measurements in an infinite cylinder uniquely determine the transversal metric. The first result is proved by using complex geometrical optics solutions involving Gaussian beam quasimodes, and the second result follows from a connection between the Calder\u00f3n problem and Gel'fand's inverse problem for the wave equation and the boundary control method.",

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is caused by strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the backbone of first-line antitubercular treatment. MDR TB affects an estimated 500 000 new patients annually. Genetic analysis of drug-resistant MDR-TB showed that airborne transmission of undetected and untreated strains played a major role in disease outbreaks. The need for new TB vaccines and faster diagnostics, as well as the development of new drugs, has recently been highlighted. The major problem in terms of current TB research and clinical demands is the increasing number of cases of extensively drug-resistant and 'treatment-refractory' TB. An emerging scenario of adjunct host-directed therapies is intended to target pulmonary TB where inflammatory processes can be deleterious and lead to immune exhaustion. 'Target-organ-saving' strategies may be warranted to prevent damage to infected tissues and achieve focused, clinically relevant and long-lasting anti-M. tb cellular immune responses. Candidates for such interventions may be biological agents or already approved drugs that can be 're-purposed' to interfere with biologically relevant cellular checkpoints. Here, we review current concepts of inflammation in TB disease and discuss candidate pathways for host-directed therapies to achieve better clinical outcomes.",

We prospectively identified equivalent ethnicity-specific obesity cut-points for the estimation of diabetes risk in British South Asians, African-Caribbeans and Europeans. Methods: We studied a population-based cohort from London, UK (1356 Europeans, 842 South Asians, 335 African-Caribbeans) who were aged 40-69 years at baseline (1988-1991), when they underwent anthropometry, fasting and post-load (75 g oral glucose tolerance test) blood tests. Incident Type 2 diabetes was identified from primary care records, participant recall and/or follow-up biochemistry. Ethnicity-specific obesity cut-points in association with diabetes incidence were estimated using negative binomial regression. Results: Diabetes incidence rates (per 1000 person years) at a median follow-up of 19 years were 20.8 (95% CI: 18.4, 23.6) and 12.0 (8.3, 17.2) in South Asian men and women, 16.5 (12.7, 21.4) and 17.5 (13.0, 23.7) in African-Caribbean men and women, and 7.4 (6.3, 8.7), and 7.2 (5.3, 9.8) in European men and women. For incidence rates equivalent to those at a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in European men and women, age- and sex-adjusted cut-points were: South Asians, 25.2 (23.4, 26.6) kg/m2; and African-Caribbeans, 27.2 (25.2, 28.6) kg/m2. For South Asian and African-Caribbean men, respectively, waist circumference cut-points of 90.4 (85.0, 94.5) and 90.6 (85.0, 94.5) cm were equivalent to a value of 102 cm in European men. Waist circumference cut-points of 84.0 (74.0, 90.0) cm in South Asian women and 81.2 (71.4, 87.4) cm in African-Caribbean women were equivalent to a value of 88 cm in European women. Conclusions: In prospective analyses, British South Asians and African-Caribbeans had equivalent diabetes incidence rates at substantially lower obesity levels than the conventional European cut-points.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Copyright SPIE.The Smart X-ray Optics (SXO) Basic Technology project started in April 2006 and will end in October 2010. The aim is to develop new technologies in the field of X-ray focusing, in particular the application of active and adaptive optics. While very major advances have been made in active/adaptive astronomical optics for visible light, little was previously achieved for X-ray optics where the technological challenges differ because of the much shorter wavelengths involved. The field of X-ray astronomy has been characterized by the development and launch of ever larger observatories with the culmination in the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra missions which are currently operational. XMM-Newton uses a multi-nested structure to provide modest angular resolution (\u223c10 arcsec) but large effective area, while Chandra sacrifices effective area to achieve the optical stability necessary to provide sub-arc second resolution. Currently the European Space Agency (ESA) is engaged in studies of the next generation of X-ray space observatories, with the aim of producing telescopes with increased sensitivity and resolution. To achieve these aims several telescopes have been proposed, for example ESA and NASA's combined International X-ray Observatory (IXO), aimed at spectroscopy, and NASA's Generation-X. In the field of X-ray astronomy sub 0.2 arcsecond resolution with high efficiency would be very exciting. Such resolution is unlikely to be achieved by anything other than an active system. The benefits of a such a high resolution would be important for a range of astrophysics subjects, for example the potential angular resolution offered by active X-ray optics could provide unprecedented structural imaging detail of the Solar Wind bowshock interaction of comets, planets and similar objects and auroral phenomena throughout the Solar system using an observing platform in low Earth orbit. A major aim of the SXO project was to investigate the production of thin actively controlled grazing incident optics for the next generation of X-ray space telescopes. Currently telescope systems are limited in the resolution and sensitivity by the optical quality of the thin shell optics used. As part of its research programme an actively controlled prototype X-ray thin shell telescope optic of dimensions 30x10cm has been developed to bench test the technology. The design is based on thin nickel shells bonded to shaped piezo-electric unimorph actuators made from lead zirconate titanate (PZT).",

This review considers current knowledge of causes and mechanisms underlying OCD, as well as assessment and treatment. Issues relating to differential diagnosis are summarised, including the challenges of distinguishing OCD from autism spectrum disorders and tic disorders in youth. The recommended treatments, namely cognitive behaviour therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibiting/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications, are outlined along with the existing evidence-based and factors associated with treatment resistance. Finally, novel clinical developments that are emerging in the field and future directions for research are discussed.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) estimated by echocardiography in the multinational European League Against Rheumatism Scleroderma Trial and Research (EUSTAR) cohort.Methods. Data for patients with echocardiography documented between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2011 were extracted from the EUSTAR database. Stepwise forward multivariable statistical Cox pulmonary hypertension analysis was used to examine the independent effect on survival of selected variables.Results. Based on our selection criteria, 1476 patients were included in the analysis; 87% of patients were female, with a mean age of 56.3 years (s.d. 13.5) and 31% had diffuse SSc. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.0 years (s.d. 1.2, median 1.9). Taking index sPAP of <30 mmHg as reference, the hazard ratio (HR) for death was 1.67 (95% CI 0.92, 2.96) if the index sPAP was between 30 and 36 mmHg, 2.37 (95% CI 1.14, 4.93) for sPAP between 36 and 40 mmHg, 3.72 (95% CI 1.61, 8.60) for sPAP between 40 and 50 mmHg and 9.75 (95% CI 4.98, 19.09) if sPAP was >50 mmHg. In a multivariable Cox model, sPAP and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were independently associated with the risk of death [HR 1.833 (95% CI 1.035, 3.247) and HR 0.973 (95% CI 0.955, 0.991), respectively]. sPAP was an independent risk factor for death with a HR of 3.02 (95% CI 1.91, 4.78) for sPAP \u226536 mmHg.Conclusion. An estimated sPAP >36 mmHg at baseline echocardiography was significantly and independently associated with reduced survival, regardless of the presence of pulmonary hypertension based on right heart catheterization.",

Methods: IgG was obtained from 4 patients with LEMS (3 males, 1 female), including 2 patients with lung malignancy. Antibodies against P/Q-type VGCCs were detected in all 4 patients, and against N-type VGCCs in 2. We incubated neuronal cultures with LEMS IgG and determined the size of the total recycling pool of synaptic vesicles and the rate of action potential-evoked exocytosis using fluorescence imaging of the amphiphilic dye SynaptoRed C1. Pooled IgG from healthy volunteers was used as a control. We repeated the experiments on synapses lacking P/Q-type calcium channels from a Cacna1a knockout mouse to determine whether these channels account for the pathogenic effect of LEMS IgG. Results: LEMS IgG had no effect on the total recycling pool size but significantly reduced the rate of action potential-evoked synaptic exocytosis in wild-type neurons when compared with neurons treated with control IgG. In contrast, LEMS IgG had no effect on the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons lacking P/Q-type channels. Conclusions: These data provide direct evidence that LEMS IgG inhibits neurotransmitter release by acting on P/Q-type VGCCs.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Kanakov et al.For practical construction of complex synthetic genetic networks able to perform elaborate functions it is important to have a pool of relatively simple modules with different functionality which can be compounded together. To complement engineering of very different existing synthetic genetic devices such as switches, oscillators or logical gates, we propose and develop here a design of synthetic multi-input classifier based on a recently introduced distributed classifier concept. A heterogeneous population of cells acts as a single classifier, whose output is obtained by summarizing the outputs of individual cells. The learning ability is achieved by pruning the population, instead of tuning parameters of an individual cell. The present paper is focused on evaluating two possible schemes of multi-input gene classifier circuits. We demonstrate their suitability for implementing a multi-input distributed classifier capable of separating data which are inseparable for single-input classifiers, and characterize performance of the classifiers by analytical and numerical results. The simpler scheme implements a linear classifier in a single cell and is targeted at separable classification problems with simple class borders. A hard learning strategy is used to train a distributed classifier by removing from the population any cell answering incorrectly to at least one training example. The other scheme implements a circuit with a bell-shaped response in a single cell to allow potentially arbitrary shape of the classification border in the input space of a distributed classifier. Inseparable classification problems are addressed using soft learning strategy, characterized by probabilistic decision to keep or discard a cell at each training iteration. We expect that our classifier design contributes to the development of robust and predictable synthetic biosensors, which have the potential to affect applications in a lot of fields, including that of medicine and industry.",

Median age at diagnosis was 43 months (Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 24-68 months), stages: I (n = 140, 40%), II (n = 106, 30%), III (n = 105, 30%). BT-WTs were higher staged, showed greater volume decrease after pre-operative chemotherapy and were diagnosed at an older median age compared to other WT patients. Patient characteristics did not differ substantially between SIOP93-01 and SIOPWT2001. Univariate analysis showed a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 80% (95% confidence interval (CI): 75-86%) (SIOPWT2001) compared to 67% in SIOP93-01 (95% CI: 59-76%; p = 0.006) and overall survival (OS) of 88% (95% CI: 83-93%) (SIOPWT2001) compared to 84% (95% CI: 77-91%; p = 0.4) in SIOP93-01. 95% of relapses were distant metastases (SIOP93-01/SIOPWT2001). Treatment protocol, age at diagnosis, tumour stage (III versus I/II) and volume (at surgery), were prognostic variables for EFS (uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis). Independent prognosticators for OS were age at diagnosis, tumour stage and volume (at surgery). The most significant survival benefit of intensified treatment, was observed in Stage I (EFS 96% in SIOPWT2001 (OS 100%), 71% in SIOP93-01 (OS 90%)). BT-WT derived benefits from more intensive chemotherapy as reflected by a reduction in relapse risk. However, the benefit of the more intensive chemotherapy to improve OS was only observed in stage I BT-WTs, by adding doxorubicin.",

This paper analyses three cases based on interview data collected from Shanghai, Guizhou, and Henan between 2009 and 2012. Each case consists of an informal local resolution to one of the three farmland dilemmas, and involves a variety of actors\u2014local entrepreneurs, ethnic minority farmers, and village committee members\u2014who act as \u2018barefoot planners\u2019.

Here we describe, for the first time, an ultrasound-mediated system that can non-invasively facilitate gene transfer into cells entrapped within fibrin-based matrices. Since ultrasound-mediated gene transfer is enhanced using microbubbles, we compared the efficacy of neutral and cationic forms of these reagents on the ultrasound-stimulated gene transfer process in gel matrices. In doing so we demonstrated the beneficial effects associated with the use of cationic microbubble preparations that interact directly with cells and nucleic acid within matrices. In some cases, gene expression was increased two-fold in gel matrices when cationic microbubbles were compared with neutral microbubbles. In addition, incorporating collagen into fibrin gels yielded a 25-fold increase in gene expression after application of ultrasound to microbubble-containing matrices. We suggest that this novel system may facilitate non-invasive temporal and spatial control of gene transfer in gel-based matrices for the purposes of tissue regeneration.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.Most population studies on physical activity and health have involved largely inactive men and women, thus making it difficult to infer if health benefits occur at exercise levels above the current minimum guidelines. The aim was to examine associations between cycling volume and classical cardiovascular risk markers, including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, in a population sample of habitual cyclists. A nationwide sample comprising 6949 men and women (aged 47.6 years on average) completed questions about their cycling levels, demographics and health. Nearly the entire sample (96.3%) achieved the current minimum physical activity recommendation through cycling alone. There was a dose-response association between cycling volume and risk of diagnosed hypertension (P-trend =0.001), with odds ratios of 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-1.21), 0.86 (0.70, 1.06), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.53-0.83) across categories of 23-40, 40-61 and >61 metabolic equivalent hours/week (MET-h/week) compared with <23 MET-h/week. These associations persisted in models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, body mass index (BMI) and other moderatevigorous physical activities. We also observed inverse associations between cycling volume and other risk factors including BMI and hypercholesterolemia. In summary, results from a population sample of cyclists suggest that additional cardiovascular health benefits can be achieved beyond the current minimum physical activity recommendation.",

We aimed to analyze demographic, depression, and trauma characteristics of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with regard to inflammatory monocyte gene expression. Fifty-six naturalistically treated MDD patients (32\u00b112years) and 57 healthy controls (HC; 31\u00b111years) were analyzed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). We determined the expression of 38 inflammatory and immune activation genes including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)\u03b1 and GR\u03b2 genes in purified CD14+ monocytes using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Monocyte gene expression was age-dependent, particularly in MDD patients. Increased monocyte gene expression and decreased GR\u03b1/\u03b2 ratio were only present in MDD patients aged \u226528years. Post hoc analyses of monocyte immune activation in patients <28years showed two subgroups: a subgroup with a severe course of depression (recurrent type, onset <15years) - additionally characterized by panic/arousal symptoms and childhood trauma - that had a monocyte gene expression similar to HC, and a second subgroup with a milder course of the disorder (73% first episode depression, onset \u226515years) - additionally characterized by the absence of panic symptoms - that exhibited a strongly reduced inflammatory monocyte activation compared to HC.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020, The Author(s).Kernel Bayesian inference is a principled approach to nonparametric inference in probabilistic graphical models, where probabilistic relationships between variables are learned from data in a nonparametric manner. Various algorithms of kernel Bayesian inference have been developed by combining kernelized basic probabilistic operations such as the kernel sum rule and kernel Bayes\u2019 rule. However, the current framework is fully nonparametric, and it does not allow a user to flexibly combine nonparametric and model-based inferences. This is inefficient when there are good probabilistic models (or simulation models) available for some parts of a graphical model; this is in particular true in scientific fields where \u201cmodels\u201d are the central topic of study. Our contribution in this paper is to introduce a novel approach, termed the model-based kernel sum rule (Mb-KSR), to combine a probabilistic model and kernel Bayesian inference. By combining the Mb-KSR with the existing kernelized probabilistic rules, one can develop various algorithms for hybrid (i.e., nonparametric and model-based) inferences. As an illustrative example, we consider Bayesian filtering in a state space model, where typically there exists an accurate probabilistic model for the state transition process. We propose a novel filtering method that combines model-based inference for the state transition process and data-driven, nonparametric inference for the observation generating process. We empirically validate our approach with synthetic and real-data experiments, the latter being the problem of vision-based mobile robot localization in robotics, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Author.The clinico-neuroradiological syndrome posterior cortical atrophy is the cardinal 'visual dementia' and most common atypical Alzheimer's disease phenotype, offering insights into mechanisms underlying clinical heterogeneity, pathological propagation and basic visual phenomena (e.g. visual crowding). Given the extensive attention paid to patients' (higher order) perceptual function, it is surprising that there have been no systematic analyses of basic oculomotor function in this population. Here 20 patients with posterior cortical atrophy, 17 patients with typical Alzheimer's disease and 22 healthy controls completed tests of fixation, saccade (including fixation/target gap and overlap conditions) and smooth pursuit eye movements using an infrared pupil-tracking system. Participants underwent detailed neuropsychological and neurological examinations, with a proportion also undertaking brain imaging and analysis of molecular pathology. In contrast to informal clinical evaluations of oculomotor dysfunction frequency (previous studies: 38%, current clinical examination: 33%), detailed eyetracking investigations revealed eye movement abnormalities in 80% of patients with posterior cortical atrophy (compared to 17% typical Alzheimer's disease, 5% controls). The greatest differences between posterior cortical atrophy and typical Alzheimer's disease were seen in saccadic performance. Patients with posterior cortical atrophy made significantly shorter saccades especially for distant targets. They also exhibited a significant exacerbation of the normal gap/overlap effect, consistent with 'sticky fixation'. Time to reach saccadic targets was significantly associated with parietal and occipital cortical thickness measures. On fixation stability tasks, patients with typical Alzheimer's disease showed more square wave jerks whose frequency was associated with lower cerebellar grey matter volume, while patients with posterior cortical atrophy showed large saccadic intrusions whose frequency correlated significantly with generalized reductions in cortical thickness. Patients with both posterior cortical atrophy and typical Alzheimer's disease showed lower gain in smooth pursuit compared to controls. The current study establishes that eye movement abnormalities are near-ubiquitous in posterior cortical atrophy, and highlights multiple aspects of saccadic performance which distinguish posterior cortical atrophy from typical Alzheimer's disease. We suggest the posterior cortical atrophy oculomotor profile (e.g. exacerbation of the saccadic gap/overlap effect, preserved saccadic velocity) reflects weak input from degraded occipito-parietal spatial representations of stimulus location into a superior collicular spatial map for eye movement regulation. This may indicate greater impairment of identification of oculomotor targets rather than generation of oculomotor movements. The results highlight the critical role of spatial attention and object identification but also precise stimulus localization in explaining the complex real world perception deficits observed in posterior cortical atrophy and many other patients with dementia-related visual impairment.",

This sub-Riemannian optics allows planar designs to function effectively as 3- or higher-dimensional media, and bulk material as dimension 4 or higher. Valid for any waves modeled by the Helmholtz equation, including scalar optics and acoustics, and with properties derived from the behavior of waves in sub-Riemannian geometry, these arrays can be assembled from nonresonant metamaterial cells and are potentially broadband.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author.When addicted individuals are exposed to drug-related stimuli, dopamine release is thought to mediate incentive salience attribution, increasing attentional bias, craving and drug seeking. It is unclear whether dopamine acts specifically on drug cues versus other rewards, and if these effects correspond with craving and other forms of cognitive bias. Here, we administered the dopamine D2/D3 agonist pramipexole (0.5 mg) to 16 tobacco smokers in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Visual fixations on smoking and money images were recorded alongside smoking urges and fluency tasks. Pramipexole attenuated a marked bias in initial orienting towards smoking relative to money but did not alter a maintained attentional bias towards smoking. Pramipexole decreased urges to smoke retrospectively after the task but not on a state scale. Fewer smoking words were generated after pramipexole but phonological and semantic fluency were preserved. Although these treatment effects did not correlate with each other, changes in initial orienting towards smoking and money were inversely related to baseline scores. In conclusion, pramipexole can reduce the salience of an addictive drug compared with other rewards and elicit corresponding changes in smoking urges and cognitive bias. These reward-specific and baseline-dependent effects support an 'inverted-U' shaped profile of dopamine in addiction.",

            "Abstract": "Transgenerational effects of maternal nutrition or other environmental 'exposures' are well recognised, but the possibility of exposure in the male influencing development and health in the next generation(s) is rarely considered. However, historical associations of longevity with paternal ancestors' food supply in the slow growth period (SGP) in mid childhood have been reported. Using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we identified 166 fathers who reported starting smoking before age 11 years and compared the growth of their offspring with those with a later paternal onset of smoking, after correcting for confounders. We analysed food supply effects on offspring and grandchild mortality risk ratios (RR) using 303 probands and their 1818 parents and grandparents from the 1890, 1905 and 1920 \u00d6verkalix cohorts, northern Sweden. After appropriate adjustment, early paternal smoking is associated with greater body mass index (BMI) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters. Sex-specific effects were also shown in the \u00d6verkalix data; paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality RR of grandsons, while paternal grandmother's food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality RR. These transgenerational effects were observed with exposure during the SGP (both grandparents) or fetal/infant life (grandmothers) but not during either grandparent's puberty. We conclude that sex-specific, male-line transgenerational responses exist in humans and hypothesise that these transmissions are mediated by the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Such responses add an entirely new dimension to the study of gene-environment interactions in development and health. \u00a9 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",

            "Abstract": "Objective: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome are highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to share genetic risk factors. However, the identi fication of definitive susceptibility genes for these etiologically complex disorders remains elusive. The authors report a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Tourette's syndrome and OCD. Method: The authors conducted aGWAS in 2,723 cases (1,310 with OCD, 834 with Tourette's syndrome, 579 with OCD plus Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics), 5,667 ancestry-matched controls, and 290 OCD parent-child trios. GWAS summary statistics were examined for enrichment of functional variants associated with gene expression levels in brain regions. Polygenic score analyses were conducted to investigate the genetic architecture within and across the two disorders. Results: Although no individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) achieved genome-wide signi ficance, the GWAS signals were enriched for SNPs strongly associated with variations in brain gene expression levels (expression quantitative loci, or eQTLs), suggesting the presence of true functional variants that contribute to risk of these disorders. Polygenic score analyses identified a significant polygenic component for OCD (p=2x10-4), predicting 3.2% of the phenotypic variance in an independent data set. In contrast, Tourette's syndrome had a smaller, nonsignificant polygenic component, predicting only 0.6% of the phenotypic variance (p=0.06). No significant polygenic signal was detected across the two disorders, although the sample is likely underpowered to detect a modest shared signal. Furthermore, the OCD polygenic signal was significantly attenuated when cases with both OCD and co-occurring Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics were included in the analysis (p=0.01). Conclusions: Previous work has shown that Tourette's syndrome and OCD have some degree of shared genetic variation. However, the data from this study suggest that there are also distinct components to the genetic architectures of these two disorders. Furthermore,OCDwith co-occurring Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics may have different underlying genetic susceptibility compared with OCD alone.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background and objectives: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is seen as a way of helping to shape health policy and ensure a patient-focused health-care system. While evidence indicates that PPI can improve health-care decision making, it also consumes monetary and non-monetary resources. Given the financial climate, it is important to start thinking about the costs and benefits of PPI and how to evaluate it in economic terms. Design: We conducted a literature review to assess the potential benefits and costs of involvement and the challenges in carrying out an economic evaluation of PPI. Results: The benefits of PPI include effects on the design of new projects or services, on NHS governance, on research design and implementation and on citizenship and equity. Economic evaluation of PPI activities is limited. The lack of an appropriate analytical framework, data recording and understanding of the potential costs and benefits of PPI, especially from participants' perspectives, represent serious constraints on the full evaluation of PPI. Conclusions: By recognizing the value of PPI, health-care providers and commissioners can embed it more effectively within their organizations. Better knowledge of costs may prompt organizations to effectively plan, execute, evaluate and target resources. This should increase the likelihood of more meaningful activity, avoid tokenism and enhance organizational efficiency and reputation.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Background Cognitive theories of depression suggest that beliefs of low self-worth and the tendency to attribute negative events to causes that are global (widespread rather than specific) and stable (will persist rather than change in the future) are associated with the development of depressed mood. Such theories are supported by evidence from prospective studies and have guided the development of successful treatment and prevention strategies such as CBT. However, the relative importance of different psychological constructs within cognitive theories is unknown. This is important to refine cognitive theories and develop more efficient prevention strategies. Method We used prospective data from over 3500 young adults from the Avon Longitudinal Study for Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort in the UK to investigate the association between cognitive style, measured by short forms of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS) and Cognitive Styles Questionnaire-Short Form (CSQ-SF) at age 18, and future depressed mood at age 19. Structural equation modelling techniques were used to separate cognitive style constructs. Results Cognitive styles were associated with future depressed mood, independently of baseline mood, both as measured by the DAS-SF and the CSQ-SF. Of the different CSQ-SF constructs, only global attributions were associated with both baseline and future mood independently of other constructs. Limitations The study was subject to attrition and the follow-up was relatively short (10 months). Conclusion The findings suggest that the tendency to attribute negative events specifically to global causes could be particularly important for depression. Reducing global attributions is potentially important in the prevention and treatment of depression.",

            "Abstract": "Smoking is a notorious risk factor for chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH). CMH frequently occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The question arises whether the same single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are related to CMH in smokers with and without COPD. We performed two genome-wide association studies of CMH under an additive genetic model in male heavy smokers (\u226520 pack-years) with COPD (n=849, 39.9% CMH) and without COPD (n=1348, 25.4% CMH), followed by replication and meta-analysis in comparable populations, and assessment of the functional relevance of significantly associated SNPs. Genome-wide association analysis of CMH in COPD and non-COPD subjects yielded no genome-wide significance after replication. In COPD, our top SNP (rs10461985, p=5.43\u00d710 -5 ) was located in the GDNF-AS1 gene that is functionally associated with the GDNF gene. Expression of GDNF in bronchial biopsies of COPD patients was significantly associated with CMH (p=0.007). In non-COPD subjects, four SNPs had a p-value <10 -5 in the meta-analysis, including a SNP (rs4863687) in the MAML3 gene, the T-allele showing modest association with CMH (p=7.57\u00d710 -6 , OR 1.48) and with significantly increased MAML3 expression in lung tissue (p=2.59\u00d710 -12 ). Our data suggest the potential for differential genetic backgrounds of CMH in individuals with and without COPD.",

Becoming fairly well-established in mainstream Anglophone medicine by 1900, it was also communicated to the public in Britain, North America and New Zealand through newspaper reports. However, the limit also travelled to less familiar places, including life assurance offices, where a number of different strategies for separating moderate from excessive drinkers emerged from the dialogue between medicine and life assurance. Whilst these ideas of moderation seem to have disappeared into the background for much of the twentieth century, re-emerging as the \"J-shaped\" curve, these early developments anticipate many of the questions surrounding uses of the \"unit\" to quantify moderate alcohol consumption in Britain today. The article will therefore conclude by exploring some of the lessons of this story for contemporary discussions of moderation, suggesting that we should pay more attention to whether these metrics work, where they work and why.",

All rights reserved.Objectives: The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with bloodstream infections remains contentious, with concerns regarding both undertreatment and the encouragement of antibiotic resistance. In our ICU we traditionally use short-course antibiotic monotherapy as the mainstay of treatment. We sought to document the impact of this strategy on pathogen type, resistance patterns and patient outcomes. A comparison was made against data collected during a similar exercise in 2000. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on all patients with community-, hospital- and ICU-acquired bacteraemia over a 6 month period (1 December 2012 to 31 May 2013) in a general medical-surgical ICU in a London university hospital. Causative pathogens, resistance patterns, use and duration of monotherapy or combination therapy, breakthrough and relapse rates, and patient outcomes were assessed. Results: The 2013 cohort comprised 113 episodes in 87 patients. Short-course monotherapy (median course 4-5 days) was used in 65.7% of episodes (73.5% in 2000). As with the 2000 cohort, the incidence of antimicrobial resistance, fungaemia, bacteraemia breakthrough and relapse remained low. Of note, there was a decreasing incidence of ICU-acquired MRSA, MDR Gram-negative bacteraemia and fluconazole-resistant candidaemia. Hospital mortality was 32% (45% in 2000). Conclusions: Our strategy predominantly utilizing short-course antibiotic monotherapy remains effective in achieving good clinical outcomes among patients with bloodstream infections, with low rates of antibiotic resistance and clinical relapse. Prospective trials of short-course monotherapy are warranted to assess clinical efficacy and antimicrobial resistance.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2016.We present all-sky modelling of the high resolution Planck, IRAS, and WISE infrared (IR) observations using the physical dust model presented by Draine & Li in 2007 (DL, ApJ, 657, 810). We study the performance and results of this model, and discuss implications for future dust modelling. The present work extends the DL dust modelling carried out on nearby galaxies using Herschel and Spitzer data to Galactic dust emission. We employ the DL dust model to generate maps of the dust mass surface density \u03a3Md, the dust optical extinction AV, and the starlight intensity heating the bulk of the dust, parametrized by Umin. The DL model reproduces the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) satisfactorily over most of the sky, with small deviations in the inner Galactic disk and in low ecliptic latitude areas, presumably due to zodiacal light contamination. In the Andromeda galaxy (M31), the present dust mass estimates agree remarkably well (within 10%) with DL estimates based on independent Spitzer and Herschel data. We compare the DL optical extinction AV for the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) with optical estimates for approximately 2 \u00d7 105 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) observed inthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The DL AV estimates are larger than those determined towards QSOs by a factor of about 2, which depends on Umin. The DL fitting parameter Umin, effectively determined by the wavelength where the SED peaks, appears to trace variations in the far-IR opacity of the dust grains per unit AV, and not only in the starlight intensity. These results show that some of the physical assumptions of the DL model will need to be revised. To circumvent the model deficiency, we propose an empirical renormalization of the DL AV estimate, dependent of Umin, which compensates for the systematic differences found with QSO observations. This renormalization, made to match the AV estimates towards QSOs, also brings into agreement the DL AV estimates with those derived for molecular clouds from the near-IR colours of stars in the 2 micron all sky survey (2MASS). The DL model and the QSOs data are also used to compress the spectral information in the Planck and IRAS observations for the diffuse ISM to a family of 20 SEDs normalized per AV, parameterized by Umin, which may be used to test and empirically calibrate dust models. The family of SEDs and the maps generated with the DL model are made public in the Planck Legacy Archive.",

All rights reserved.Spinal neurodegeneration is an important determinant of disability progression in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Advanced imaging techniques, such as single-voxel 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and q-space imaging, have increased pathological specificity for neurodegeneration, but are challenging to implement in the spinal cord and have yet to be applied in early primary progressive multiple sclerosis. By combining these imaging techniques with new clinical measures, which reflect spinal cord pathology more closely than conventional clinical tests, we explored the potential for spinal magnetic resonance spectroscopy and q-space imaging to detect early spinal neurodegeneration that may be responsible for clinical disability. Data from 21 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis within 6 years of disease onset, and 24 control subjects were analysed. Patients were clinically assessed on grip strength, vibration perception thresholds and postural stability, in addition to the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Nine Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, and Modified Ashworth Scale. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy and q-space imaging of the cervical cord and conventional brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Multivariate analyses and multiple regression models were used to assess the differences in imaging measures between groups and the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging measures and clinical scores, correcting for age, gender, spinal cord cross-sectional area, brain T2 lesion volume, and brain white matter and grey matter volume fractions. Although patients did not show significant cord atrophy when compared with healthy controls, they had significantly lower total N-acetyl-aspartate (mean 4.01 versus 5.31 mmol/l, P = 0.020) and glutamate-glutamine (mean 4.65 versus 5.93 mmol/l, P = 0.043) than controls. Patients showed an increase in q-space imaging-derived indices of perpendicular diffusivity in both the whole cord and major columns compared with controls (P<0.05 for all indices). Lower total N-acetyl-aspartate was associated with higher disability, as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (coefficient =-0.41, 0.01<P<0.05), Modified Ashworth Scale (coefficient =-3.78, 0.01<P<0.05), vibration perception thresholds (coefficient =-4.37, P = 0.021) and postural sway (P<0.001). Lower glutamate-glutamine predicted increased postural sway (P = 0.017). Increased perpendicular diffusivity in the whole cord and columns was associated with increased scores on the Modified Ashworth Scale, vibration perception thresholds and postural sway (P<0.05 in all cases). These imaging findings indicate reduced structural integrity of neurons, demyelination, and abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways in the cervical cord of early primary progressive multiple sclerosis, in the absence of extensive spinal cord atrophy. The observed relationship between imaging measures and disability suggests that early spinal neurodegeneration may underlie clinical impairment, and should be targeted in future clinical trials with neuroprotective agents to prevent the development of progressive disability.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Ethnopharmacological relevance Bangladesh has a rich traditional plant-medicine use, drawing on Ayurveda and Unami medicine. How these practices translate into people's homes and lives vary. Furthermore, the overlap between food and medicine is blurred and context-specific. This paper explores the food-medicine interface as experienced by Bengali women in their homes, in the context of transnational and generational changes. Aim and objectives The aim is to explore the overlap of food and medicines in homes of Bengali women in Sylhet. The objectives are to explore the influences on medicinal plant practice and to scrutinise how catagories of food and medicine are decided. Material and methods The paper draws on in-depth ethnographic research conducted in Sylhet, North-east Bangladesh as part of a wider project looking at food and medicine use among Bengali women in both the UK and Bangladesh. Methods included participant observation, unstructured interviews and semi-structured interviews with a total of thirty women. Results The study indicates that the use of plants as food and medicine is common among Bengali women in Sylhet. What is consumed as a food and/or a medicine varies between individuals, generations and families. The use and perceptions of food-medicines is also dependent on multiple factors such as age, education and availability of both plants and biomedicine. Where a plant may fall on the food-medicine spectrum depends on a range of factors including its purpose, consistency and taste. Conclusions Previous academic research has concentrated on the nutritional and pharmacological properties of culturally constructed food-medicines (Etkin and Ross, 1982; Owen and Johns, 2002, Pieroni and Quave, 2006). However, our findings indicate a contextualisation of the food-plant spectrum based on both local beliefs and wider structural factors, and thus not necessarily characteristics intrinsic to the products' pharmacological or nutritional properties. The implications of this research are of both academic relevance and practical importance to informing health services.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.We present a large-scale study of commonality in liquidity and resilience across assets in an ultra high-frequency (millisecond-timestamped) Limit Order Book (LOB) data-set from a pan-European electronic equity trading facility. We first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through the degree of explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity (extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy-tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity measures in the asset cross section, but also reduces higher order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation proposed by Panayi et al. [Market resilience, 2014] for the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured by the majority of liquidity measures and has important ramifications for understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across a range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from the vast LOB data-set is then amenable to a functional data representation. This enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross section via functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components analysis) can explain between 10 and 40% of the variation in liquidity resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author.Background Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) effectively controls human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but does not eliminate HIV, and lifelong treatment is therefore required. HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses decline following cART initiation. Alterations in other HIV-specific immune responses that may assist in eliminating latent HIV infection, specifically antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), are unclear. Methods A cohort of 49 cART-naive HIV-infected subjects from Thailand (mean baseline CD4 count, 188 cells/\u03bcL; mean viral load, 5.4 log<inf>10</inf> copies/mL) was followed for 96 weeks after initiating cART. ADCC and ADP assays were performed using serum samples obtained at baseline and after 96 weeks of cART. Results A 35% reduction in HIV type 1 envelope (Env)-specific ADCC-mediated killing of target cells (P <. 001) was observed after 96 weeks of cART. This was corroborated by a significant reduction in the ability of Env-specific ADCC antibodies to activate natural killer cells (P <. 001). Significantly reduced ADP was also observed after 96 weeks of cART (P =. 018). Conclusions This longitudinal study showed that cART resulted in significant reductions of HIV-specific effector antibody responses, including ADCC and ADP. Therapeutic vaccines or other immunomodulatory approaches may be required to improve antibody-mediated control of HIV during cART.",

While some young child domestic workers work long hours, suffer physical punishment and are at risk of psychosocial harm, others are able to attend school and benefit from good relationships with their employers and networks of support. Child domestic workers in India and Togo were most at risk of psychosocial harm. We conclude that classification of this employment as hazardous would not be appropriate and could be counterproductive and instead propose that legislation focuses on protective factors such as a social and community support.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Early treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is vital. However, people often delay in seeking help at symptom onset. An assessment of the reasons behind patient delay is necessary to develop interventions to promote rapid consultation. Objective: Using a mixed methods design, we aimed to develop and test a questionnaire to assess the barriers to help seeking at RA onset. Design: Questionnaire items were extracted from previous qualitative studies. Fifteen people with a lived experience of arthritis participated in focus groups to enhance the questionnaire's face validity. The questionnaire was also reviewed by groups of multidisciplinary health-care professionals. A test-retest survey of 41 patients with newly presenting RA or unclassified arthritis assessed the questionnaire items' intraclass correlations. Results: During focus groups, participants rephrased questions, added questions and deleted items not relevant to the questionnaire's aims. Participants organized items into themes: early symptom experience, initial reactions to symptoms, self-management behaviours, causal beliefs, involvement of significant others, pre-diagnosis knowledge about RA, direct barriers to seeking help and relationship with GP. The test-retest survey identified seven items (out of 79) with low intraclass correlations which were removed from the final questionnaire. Conclusion: The involvement of people with a lived experience of arthritis and multidisciplinary health-care professionals in the preliminary validation of the DELAY (delays in evaluating arthritis early) questionnaire has enriched its development. Preliminary assessment established its reliability. The DELAY questionnaire provides a tool for researchers to evaluate individual, cultural and health service barriers to help-seeking behaviour at RA onset.",

This form of outbreeding depression provides an evolutionary incentive for self-fertilization. We show that the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus tends to self-fertilize when it is well adapted to its local environment but tends to outcross when it is poorly adapted. This behavior could preserve combinations of genes when they are beneficial and break them up when they are not, thereby helping adaptation. Haploid spores must germinate before mating, and we found that fitter spores had higher rates of germination across a 24-hour period, increasing the probability that they mate with germinated spores from the same meiotic tetrad. The ability of yeast spores to detect local conditions before germinating and mating suggests the novel possibility that these gametes directly sense their own adaptation and plastically adjust their breeding strategy accordingly.",

We report the experiences of visually impaired (VI) children and young people aged 10-15 years about growing up with impaired sight. Methods: The participants were 32 VI children and young people, aged 10-15 years [visual acuity logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) worse than 0.51] recruited through National Health Service (NHS) paediatric ophthalmology and developmental vision clinics and 11 VI pupils aged 12-17 attending a specialist school for pupils with disabilities. Individual semi-structured interviews with participants captured their experiences of living with a visual impairment. A child-centred interview topic guide was developed from a literature review, observations at ophthalmology clinics, consultation with health and education professionals working with VI children and young people, and interviews and a focus group with VI pupils from the specialist school. Collaborative qualitative thematic analysis by three researchers identified emergent themes. NVivo software was used for coding the data. Results: Analysis identified six themes concerning living with a visual impairment: (i) social relationships, participation and acceptance; (ii) independence and autonomy; (iii) psychological and emotional well-being; (iv) aspirations and concerns about the future; (v) functioning - home, school and leisure; and (vi) treatment of eye condition. Key issues included: the importance of family and peer support; balancing independence, support and safety; the emotional burden and adjustment of living with a disability; concerns about education and job prospects in the future; functional restrictions and limitations; and ongoing management of the eye condition. Conclusions: The findings offer insights into the complex realities of living with visual impairment. They provide the basis for development of patient-reported outcome measures. They can also serve to help enrich the understanding of health professionals working with VI children and young people, potentially enabling them to better support them.",

One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions (MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as \u201csingle-spike information\u201d to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based perspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical single-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a Poisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find maximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as Poisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive a lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete time bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality reduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that they can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic terms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of stimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the non-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model. We illustrate these methods with simulations and data from primate visual cortex.",

Cross sections are measured as functions of a variety of observables, including angular correlations and invariant masses of the objects in the final state, \u03b3 + jet + jet. Measurements are also performed in phase-space regions enriched in each of the two underlying physical mechanisms, namely direct and fragmentation processes. The measurements cover the range of photon (jet) transverse momenta from 150 GeV (100 GeV) to 2 TeV. The tree-level plus parton-shower predictions from Sherpa and Pythia as well as the next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from Sherpa are compared with the measurements. The next-to-leading-order QCD predictions describe the data adequately in shape and normalisation except for regions of phase space such as those with high values of the invariant mass or rapidity separation of the two jets, where the predictions overestimate the data.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.GABAA receptors are important for inhibition in the CNS where neurosteroids and protein kinases are potent endogenous modulators. Acting individually, these can either enhance or depress receptor function, dependent upon the type of neurosteroid or kinase and the receptor subunit combination. However, in vivo, these modulators probably act in concert to fine-tune GABAA receptor activity and thus inhibition, although how this is achieved remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between these modulators at synaptic-type \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32L and extrasynaptic-type \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 GABAA receptors using electrophysiology. For \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32L, potentiation of GABA responses by tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone was reduced after inhibiting protein kinase C, and enhanced following its activation, suggesting this kinase regulates neurosteroid modulation. In comparison, neurosteroid potentiation was reduced at \u03b11\u03b23S408A,S409A\u03b32L receptors, and unaltered by PKC inhibitors or activators, indicating that phosphorylation of \u03b23 subunits is important for regulating neurosteroid activity. To determine whether extrasynaptic-type GABAA receptors were similarly modulated, \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 and \u03b14\u03b23S408A,S409A\u03b4 receptors were investigated. Neurosteroid potentiation was reduced at both receptors by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. By contrast, neurosteroid-mediated potentiation at \u03b14S443A\u03b23S408A,S409A\u03b4 receptors was unaffected by protein kinase inhibition, strongly suggesting that phosphorylation of \u03b14 and \u03b23 subunits is required for regulating neurosteroid activity at extrasynaptic receptors. Western blot analyses revealed that neurosteroids increased phosphorylation of \u03b23S408,S409 implying that a reciprocal pathway exists for neurosteroids to modulate phosphorylation of GABAA receptors. Overall, these findings provide important insight into the regulation of GABAA receptors in vivo, and into the mechanisms by which GABAergic inhibitory transmission may be simultaneously tuned by two endogenous neuromodulators.

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies 2014.Background: Studies of both clinical and non-clinical voice hearers suggest that distress is rather inconsistently associated with the perceived relationship between voice and hearer. It is also not clear if their beliefs about voices are relevant. Aims: This study investigated the links between attachment anxiety/avoidance, interpersonal aspects of the voice relationship, and distress whilst considering the impact of beliefs about voices and paranoia. Method: Forty-four voice-hearing participants completed a number of self-report measures tapping attachment, interpersonal processes in the voice relationship, beliefs about voices, paranoia, distress and depression. Results: Attachment avoidance was related to voice intrusiveness, hearer distance and distress. Attachment anxiety was related to voice intrusiveness, hearer dependence and distress. A series of simple mediation analyses were conducted that suggest that the relationship between attachment and voice related distress may be mediated by interpersonal dynamics in the voice-hearer relationship, beliefs about voices and paranoia. Conclusions: Beliefs about voices, the hearer's relationship with their voices, and the distress voices sometimes engender appear to be meaningfully related to their attachment style. This may be important to consider in therapeutic work.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).We design logic circuits based on the notion of zero forcing on graphs; each gate of the circuits is a gadget in which zero forcing is performed. We show that such circuits can evaluate every monotone Boolean function. By using two vertices to encode each logical bit, we obtain universal computation. We also highlight a phenomenon of \u201cback forcing\u201d as a property of each function. Such a phenomenon occurs in a circuit when the input of gates which have been already used at a given time step is further modified by a computation actually performed at a later stage. Finally, we show that zero forcing can be also used to implement reversible computation. The model introduced here provides a potentially new tool in the analysis of Boolean functions, with particular attention to monotonicity. Moreover, in the light of applications of zero forcing in quantum mechanics, the link with Boolean functions may suggest a new directions in quantum control theory and in the study of engineered quantum spin systems. It is an open technical problem to verify whether there is a link between zero forcing and computation with contact circuits.",

Yet, as the essays in this volume make clear, there are in fact a number of shared features and points of contact that make the study of these issues a particularly fertile area for scholars of the Reformation period. Whether it be the concept of an individual's relationship with God-so often articulated in familial terms, the place of domestic devotions, or the difficulties that faced families split by rival confessional beliefs and mixed marriages, this book demonstrates how piety and family life were interwoven in the social and theological landscape of early modern Europe. Inspired by the works of Steven Ozment, the volume is divided into two sections, each of which deals with a particular concern of his writings. The first four chapters address issues of Reformation theology and the medieval heritage, whilst the remaining seven examine the spiritual life of families. Together they underline how modern scholarship by broadening its conceptual outlook and bringing together seemingly unrelated subjects, can provide a more sophisticated understanding of the past.",

Margaret Mahler's separation- individuation processes and Joseph Sandler's object relations theory are then discussed as critical contributions to the psychoanalytic developmental theory. All three psychoanalysts started from the basis of the structural approach, but ended up modifying the structural tradition in various ways.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2015.The interrelated operation of different regimes of international economic law (IEL) may involve the presence of mutually contradictory or inconsistent elements.1 It would not be unreasonable to expect a further sharpening of these considerations during and after crises. This chapter addresses a tangle of rules, regimes, and paradigms, exploring the limits of the consistency of countermeasures in international economic law, on the basis of a case study taken from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The starting point of the discussion on countermeasures is that rules of international law on the issue display considerable tensions, wavering between recognition of their conceptual and practical importance and nothing the structural inevitability of abuse. Kelsen famously considered the presence and effectiveness of countermeasures an appropriate benchmark for evaluating the validity of international law as a legal order; other authors have emphasised the great possibilities for abuse inherent in a regime permitting decentralised breaches of law (even with wrongfulness precluded). In the last decade, elaboration of the law of countermeasures has, somewhat unexpectedly, taken place through adjudication in international economic law. The immortal trio of cases which have shaped the modern law have been supplemented by the reports of the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body (WTO DSB) and by three awards given by investment treaty Tribunals. The twists and pulls of these different regimes - investor-state and inter-state - provide a fascinating case study of the operation of international economic law, permitting an exploration of uncertainties within and between trade and investment regimes, and raising the question of the possibility of certainty at the \u2018meta-level\u2019 of legal reasoning. The operation of countermeasures in international economic law has been addressed in legal writings, both regarding the lex specialis countermeasures in WTO law and the general international law countermeasures in investment protection law. Their possible interplay has also been dealt with.",

            "Abstract": "Background: Involving service users in research can be an effective way of improving the practicalities and acceptability of interventions for target end users. Objectives: The current paper presented two consensus methods, not commonly used in consultation with service users, to develop a peer support intervention for family carers of people with dementia (SHIELD Carer Supporter Programme). Design: Study 1 was a modified Delphi process combined with a consensus conference to explore details of the intervention from the carer and volunteer perspective. Study 2 was an anonymous reader consultation to develop informed consent documents for the intervention trial. Median scores were used to measure and establish consensus. Open-ended responses were thematically analysed. Setting and participants: Study 1: twenty-five delegates participated (eight were current/former carers) in the first round Delphi questionnaire, with 21 attending the conference. Five completed the Round 2 questionnaire. Study 2: six family carers and 11 people with dementia took part in the consultation. Results: Study 1: the role of the peer supporters was developed in terms of relational and practical aspects of the intervention. Study 2: changes were made to the documents, reflecting service user input, but the effectiveness of this less discursive type of service user involvement was unclear. Discussion and conclusions: Study 1 methods allowed for service users to contribute significantly and meaningfully, but maybe limiting some design innovation. Study 2 took a more traditional and less collaborative approach. This has implications for balancing the needs of the research with meaningful service user involvement in research. copy; 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

More recently, it has been recognized as a pathogen for those admitted to intensive care units, for the elderly and for the general population. The epidemiology and molecular and cellular pathology of this virus are summarized to provide an overarching model of pathogenesis, able to account for these varying clinical presentations. In brief, HCMV has the potential to spread in the bloodstream to all organs, but only produces overt disease if the viral load increases to high levels. This is normally prevented by a robust immune response, so that the infected individual usually remains asymptomatic. However, this benefit comes at the cost of committing more and more immunological resources to controlling HCMV with time, so that the overall function of the immune system is impaired. Fortunately, recent progress in developing novel antiviral drugs and vaccines suggests the possibility that the diverse effects of HCMV may soon become controllable at the individual and population level, respectively.",

This paper represents an effort to move beyond the preference centricity. In this paper, an ideal Pigovian regulatory intervention is emulated and added into Schelling's (1971) classic spatial proximity model of racial segregation, with an aim to preserve collective welfare against the negative externalities induced by the changing local racial compositions after individual relocations. A key discovery from a large number of cellular automata is that the Pigovian regulation tends to result in less segregated but also less efficient (in terms of aggregate utility) residential patterns than laissez faire. This finding, albeit from a highly stylized model, bears intellectual relations to an important practical question: What are the potential racial effects of Pigovian local planning interventions, such as financially motivated anti-density zoning or the collection of a development impact fee?

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.It is known that an n-dimensional convex body, which is typical in the sense of Baire category, shows a simple, but highly non-intuitive curvature behaviour: at almost all of its boundary points, in the sense of measure, all curvatures are zero, but there is also a dense and uncountable set of boundary points at which all curvatures are infinite. The purpose of this paper is to find a counterpart to this phenomenon for typical convex bodies of given constant width. Such bodies cannot have zero curvatures. A main result says that for a typical n-dimensional convex body of constant width 1 (without loss of generality), at almost all boundary points, in the sense of measure, all curvatures are equal to 1. (In contrast, note that a ball of width 1 has radius 1/2, hence all its curvatures are equal to 2.) Since the property of constant width is linear with respect to Minkowski addition, the proof requires recourse to a linear curvature notion, which is provided by the tangential radii of curvature.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.Cells exposed to extreme physicochemical or mechanical stimuli die in an uncontrollable manner, as a result of their immediate structural breakdown. Such an unavoidable variant of cellular demise is generally referred to as 'accidental cell death' (ACD). In most settings, however, cell death is initiated by a genetically encoded apparatus, correlating with the fact that its course can be altered by pharmacologic or genetic interventions. 'Regulated cell death' (RCD) can occur as part of physiologic programs or can be activated once adaptive responses to perturbations of the extracellular or intracellular microenvironment fail. The biochemical phenomena that accompany RCD may be harnessed to classify it into a few subtypes, which often (but not always) exhibit stereotyped morphologic features. Nonetheless, efficiently inhibiting the processes that are commonly thought to cause RCD, such as the activation of executioner caspases in the course of apoptosis, does not exert true cytoprotective effects in the mammalian system, but simply alters the kinetics of cellular demise as it shifts its morphologic and biochemical correlates. Conversely, bona fide cytoprotection can be achieved by inhibiting the transduction of lethal signals in the early phases of the process, when adaptive responses are still operational. Thus, the mechanisms that truly execute RCD may be less understood, less inhibitable and perhaps more homogeneous than previously thought. Here, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death formulates a set of recommendations to help scientists and researchers to discriminate between essential and accessory aspects of cell death.",

Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferationinducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75 mg or atacicept 150 mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4 weeks, then weekly for 48 weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively. Results: Enrolment in the atacicept 150 mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75 mg and placebo. Analysis of patients treated with atacicept 150 mg suggested beneficial effect versus placebo in flare rates (OR: 0.48, p=0.002) and time to first flare (HR: 0.56, p=0.009). Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and antidsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.OBJECTIVES: Perhexiline is thought to modulate metabolism by inhibiting mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, reducing fatty acid uptake and increasing carbohydrate utilization. This study assessed whether preoperative perhexiline improves markers of myocardial protection in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and analysed its effect on the myocardial metabolome. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients at two centres were randomized to receive either oral perhexiline or placebo for at least 5 days prior to surgery. The primary outcome was a low cardiac output episode in the first 6 h. All pre-specified analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle with a statistical power of 90% to detect a relative risk of 0.5 and a conventional one-sided \u03b1-value of 0.025. A subset of pre-ischaemic left ventricular biopsies was analysed using mass spectrometrybased metabolomics. RESULTS: Over a 3-year period, 286 patients were randomized, received the intervention and were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of a low cardiac output episode in the perhexiline arm was 36.7% (51/139) vs 34.7% (51/147) in the control arm [odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-1.50, P = 0.74]. Perhexiline was associated with a reduction in the cardiac index at 6 h [difference in means 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.31, P = 0.001] and an increase in inotropic support in the first 12 h (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34-0.89, P = 0.015). There were no significant differences in myocardial injury with troponin-T or electrocardiogram, reoperation, renal dysfunction or length of stay. No difference in the preischaemic left ventricular metabolism was identified between groups onmetabolomics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative perhexiline does not improve myocardial protection in patients undergoing coronary surgery and in fact reduced perioperative cardiac output, increasing the need for inotropic support. Perhexiline has no significant effect on the mass spectrometry- visible polar myocardial metabolome in vivo in humans, supporting the suggestion that it acts via a pathway that is independent of myocardial carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibition and may explain the lack of clinical benefit observed following surgery.",

Methods Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. Objective We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. Results Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 \u00d7 106/L (range, 11-440 \u00d7 106/L) and 200 \u00d7 106/L (range, 5-310 \u00d7 106/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/106 T cells (range, 320-8,807/106 T cells) and 4,184/106 T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/106 T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in 7 of 12 patients. In 2 patients early transient autoimmune hemolysis settled after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis (3), hemolysis (1), thrombocytopenia (4), and neutropenia (1). Conclusions This study confirms the previous reports that thymus transplantation can reconstitute T cells in patients with cDGS but with frequent autoimmune complications in survivors.",

(2001) [35] and Alf\u00e8 and Gillan, (2004) [36] has demonstrated the reduction of the O(N3) cost of evaluating the Slater determinant with planewaves to O(N2) using localized basis functions. We compare four polynomial approximations as basis functions - interpolating Lagrange polynomials, interpolating piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-) splines, and basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and smoothing). All these basis functions provide a similar speedup relative to the planewave basis. The pp-splines have eight times the memory requirement of the other methods. To test the accuracy of the basis functions, we apply them to the ground state structures of Si, Al, and MgO. The polynomial approximations differ in accuracy most strongly for MgO, and smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the planewave value for of the variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate approximations for the Laplacian of the orbitals increases the accuracy sufficiently to justify the increased memory requirement, making smoothing B-splines, with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred choice for approximating planewave-represented orbitals in QMC calculations.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Quintessenz all rights reserved.Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of various formulations of chlorhexidine 0.2% (CHX) in terms of plaque and gingival bleeding control compared to each other and to saline rinse (CTRL) over a 35-day rinsing period. Materials and Methods: Seventy subjects were randomly allocated to one of 4 groups rinsing twice daily for 35 days. The different groups used CHX 0.2% rinse with alcohol (CHX1) and without alcohol (CHX2), with an antidiscolouration system (CHX3) or saline rinse (CTRL). Clinical examinations to evaluate full-mouth plaque scores (FMPS) and periodontal parameters were performed at baseline, 7, 21 and 35 days. Tooth discolouration (TD) was measured at each time point using digital photographs and spectrophotometric analysis. Results: At 35 days, CTRL showed the highest levels of plaque. The mean changes in FMPS from baseline were 69.8% \u00b1 6.8 for CHX1, 57.5% \u00b1 9.8 for CHX2, 43.7% \u00b1 9.8 for CHX3 and 25.8% \u00b1 7.7 for CTRL. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between CHX1 and CHX3 (p = 0.02), CHX2 vs CHX3 (p \u2264 0.05) and CHX1/CHX2 vs CHX3 (p < 0.05). In contrast, CHX3 appeared more effective in reducing inflammatory indexes. TD increased over time in 60% to 70% of participants, although lighter staining was found in the CHX3 group. Greater FMPS reduction was observed in participants with staining vs without staining (26.0% \u00b1 12.3, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Conventional CHX appeared more effective in terms of plaque reduction. Interestingly, the newest formulation showed a higher control of gingival inflammation. Staining was associated with lower plaque levels.",

The field has evolved from the use of gammaretroviral vectors to more sophisticated lentiviral platforms that offer an improved biosafety profile alongside greater efficiency for hematopoietic stem cells gene transfer. Here we review more recent developments including licensing of gene therapies, use of gene corrected autologous T cells as an alternative strategy for some PIDs and the potential of targeted gene correction using various gene editing platforms.

All rights reserved.Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric condition characterized by severe weight loss and secondary problems associated with malnutrition. AN predominantly develops in adolescence in the peripubertal period. Without early effective treatment, the course is protracted with physical, psychological and social morbidity and high mortality. Despite these effects, patients are noted to value the beliefs and behaviours that contribute to their illness rather than regarding them as problematic, which interferes with screening, prevention and early intervention. Involving the family to support interventions early in the course of the illness can produce sustained changes; however, those with a severe and/or protracted illness might require inpatient nursing support and/or outpatient psychotherapy. Prevention programmes aim to moderate the overvaluation of 'thinness' and body dissatisfaction as one of the proximal risk factors. The low prevalence of AN limits the ability to identify risk factors and to study the timing and sex distribution of the condition. However, genetic profiles, premorbid features, and brain structures and functions of patients with AN show similarities with other psychiatric disorders and contrast with obesity and metabolic disorders. Such studies are informing approaches to address the neuroadaptation to starvation and the other various physical and psychosocial deficits associated with AN. This Primer describes the epidemiology, diagnosis, screening and prevention, aetiology, treatment and quality of life of patients with AN.",

Membrane filtration was the most common technique, albumin the most frequently used substitution fluid, and heparin the preferred anticoagulant. PE achieved full disease remission in 25 patients (37.3 %), partial remission in 22 (32.8 %), and had no effect in 20 (29.9 %). The response to IA/DFPP was complete in seven patients (53.8 %), partial in five (38.5 %), and absent in one (7.7 %). Minor adverse events occurred during 6.9 % of PE and 9.7 % of IA/DFPP sessions.Conclusions: PE, IA, and DFPP are safe apheresis methods in children.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2015.There is an acknowledged need for improved conservation of plastic and rubber objects within collections, including improved methods of condition assessment, material identification, and better understanding of material degradation. This reflects the inherent instability and wide-ranging formulations of many such objects and also the relative lack of knowledge in this field. Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a useful method for understanding the chemical processes involved in polymer degradation and for the identification of materials. Conservators and curators have used odor analysis to identify historical plastics for many years, and techniques ranging from acid detection strips to laboratory-based techniques such as solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry have been used to characterize plastic and rubber materials and to understand their degradation. VOC analysis also has potential as a technique for bulk material identification, as a complementary tool to spectroscopic analysis of the surface. A significant advantage of VOC analysis is its potential to be non-invasive, avoiding destructive sampling or even contact with an object. However, there is a greater potential for VOC analysis to be of benefit within conservation than is currently being exploited and significant scope for future research. In fields such as construction or waste management, there is also significant research into analysis of VOC emissions from plastic and rubber materials. The goal of this paper is to systematically review research from a range of fields including conservation, polymer degradation, and plastics recycling and it includes the use of VOC analysis to understand the causes of damage to plastic and rubber objects, to provide evidence of degradation and to monitor degradation progress, and to identify materials and distinguish between different formulations. Summaries of relevant studies are given, and volatile markers of object damage and polymer degradation and key volatile identifiers of a particular material are highlighted.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 .Cognitive impairment is an important predictor of functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia, yet its neurobiology is still incompletely understood. Neuropathological evidence of impaired synaptic connectivity and NMDA receptor-dependent transmission in superior temporal cortex motivated us to explore the correlation of in vivo mismatch negativity (MMN) with cognitive status in patients with schizophrenia. MMN elicited in a roving stimulus paradigm displayed a response proportional to the number of stimulus repetitions (memory trace effect). Preliminary evidence in patients with chronic schizophrenia suggests that attenuation of this MMN memory trace effect was correlated with the degree of neuropsychological memory dysfunction. Here we present data from a larger confirmatory study in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, probable Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls. We observed that the diminution of the MMN memory trace effect and its correlation with memory impairment was only found in the schizophrenia group. Recent pharmacological studies using the roving paradigm suggest that attenuation of the MMN trace effect can be understood as abnormal modulation of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity. We suggest that the convergence of the previously identified synaptic pathology in supragranular cortical layers with the intracortical locus of MMN generation accounts for the remarkable robustness of MMN impairments in schizophrenia. We further speculate that this layer-specific synaptic pathology identified in supragranular neurons plays a pivotal computational role, by weakening the encoding and propagation of prediction errors to higher cortical modules. According to predictive coding theory such breakdown will have grave implications not only for perception, but also for higher-order cognition and may thus account for the MMN-cognition correlations observed here. Finally, MMN is a sensitive and specific biomarker for detecting the early prodromal phase of schizophrenia and is well suited for the exploration of novel cognition-enhancing agents in humans.",

A diverse sample of 32 ICE investigators across all nine Australian jurisdictions individually participated in anonymous in-depth interviews. Participants were asked to discuss their subjective experience of viewing ICE material and its effect on them and to describe a case that evoked an adverse reaction, the nature of the reaction, and the characteristics of the material that contributed to it. The results revealed that ICE investigators experience salient emotional, cognitive, social and behavioural consequences due to viewing ICE material and their reactions can be short and long term. The degree of negative impact appears to vary markedly across individuals, types and content of material and viewing context, with variation based on individual, case-related and contextual factors both in and outside the workplace.",

It is shown, however, that the modal extension has unsavoury consequences for both absolutism and dialetheism. While the logic commits the absolutist to dialetheism, it commits the dialetheist to the impossibility of the actual world. A new modal logic AV is then proposed which avoids these unsavoury consequences by invalidating the interdefinability rules for the modal operators with the use of two valuation relations. However, while using AV carries no significant cost for the absolutist, the same isn't true for the dialetheist. Although using AV allows her to avoid the consequence that the actual world is an impossible world, it does so only on the condition that the dialetheist admits that she cannot give a dialetheic solution to all self-referential semantic paradoxes. Thus, unless there are any further available modal logics that don't commit her to the impossibility of the actual world, the dialetheist is faced with a dilemma. Either admit that the actual world is an impossible world, or admit that her research programme cannot give a comprehensive solution to the self-referential paradoxes.",

Measurement artefacts may limit the use of OCT to MS research. Objective: An expert task force convened with the aim to provide guidance on the use of validated quality control (QC) criteria for the use of OCT in MS research and clinical trials. Methods: A prospective multi-centre (n = 13) study. Peripapillary ring scan QC rating of an OCT training set (n = 50) was followed by a test set (n = 50). Inter-rater agreement was calculated using kappa statistics. Results were discussed at a round table after the assessment had taken place. Results: The inter-rater QC agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.7). Disagreement was found highest for judging signal strength (kappa = 0.40). Future steps to resolve these issues were discussed. Conclusion: Substantial agreement for QC assessment was achieved with aid of the OSCAR-IB criteria. The task force has developed a website for free online training and QC certification. The criteria may prove useful for future research and trials in MS using OCT as a secondary outcome measure in a multicentre setting.",

The real effects are computed as asymmetric impulse responses of output to inflation separately in the regimes with different signs of the differences between the expected inflation and the predicted output-neutral inflation. It is found that, with the increase in inflation, such effects increase in the regime with the positive sign, relatively to the effects in the regime with the negative sign. It is also shown that this finding is valid for most countries with high inflation episodes, where inflation is greater than 4.8% for at least 25% of quarterly observations. This leads to a simple policy prescription that, in economies with frequent high inflation episodes, anti-inflationary monetary decisions are least damaging for output if undertaken in the periods when the difference between the expected and output-neutral inflation is negative.",

Patients and Methods In all, 58 men with NOA underwent m-TESE. All the patients had previously undergone either single/multiple TESE or TESA with no sperm found. All the patients underwent an m-TESE using a standard technique. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and histopathological diagnosis were examined as predictive factors for sperm recovery. All patients underwent preoperative genetic screening. One patient was found to have an azoospermic factor c (AZFc) micro-deletion and five were diagnosed with Kleinfelter's syndrome. Results The mean (range) patient age was 39.0 (26-57) years. Spermatozoa were successfully retrieved in 27 men by m-TESE (46.5%). The mean (range) FSH level was 19.4 (1.6-58.5) IU/L. There was no correlation in age (mean age retrieved 38.1 years, not retrieved 39.7 years, P = 0.38), FSH levels (mean FSH retrieved 21.4 IU/L, not retrieved 17.7 IU/L, P = 0.3) and the ability to find sperm by m-TESE. However, there was a significant difference in testosterone levels and sperm retrieval (mean testosterone retrieved 14.99 nmol/L, not retrieved 11.39 nmol/L, P < 0.05). Patients with a diagnosis of Sertoli-cell-only (SCO) syndrome [14/35 (40%)] and maturation arrest [four of 11 (36%)] had lower sperm retrieval rates than those in the hypospermatogenesis group [nine of 12 (75.0%)] (P < 0.05). There were no significant complications after m-TESE. Conclusions In men with NOA who have undergone previous attempts at sperm retrieval with negative results, a salvage m-TESE offers a significant chance of finding sperm even in SCO syndrome. There does seem to be a correlation between preoperative testosterone levels and the ability to successfully find sperm.",

However, the panel has become warped over time and there is a join on the left side, where it has suffered a break in the past. It has been connected with two metal pins and adhesive in a previous conservation treatment but there is now concern that these could be having an adverse influence on natural movements within the ivory. Given the importance of the panel, the decision was made to leave the pins in place and monitor the stability of the panel. As the geometry of the panel is complex, it was felt that microscopic imaging would not be suitable and 3D laser scanning was used instead. This engineering metrology technique is increasingly used in cultural heritage and conservation to record minute three-dimensional changes with high spatial accuracy. The resulting dataset is a detailed metric 3D record of the object surface in-the-round and comparison of subsequent scans with a reference scan can indicate dimensional changes. As part of a monitoring campaign, the ivory panel was first scanned in January 2012 to provide a reference scan. It was then scanned again in autumn 2012 (no significant movement was detected) and will be scanned at regular intervals in the future. This case study demonstrates the potential of 3D laser scanning to monitor the dimensional stability of complex artefacts.",

Key independent variables include levels of technical expertise, cadre age, counter-terrorism policies experienced, brigade size, and IED components and delivery methods. We find that technical expertise within a brigade allows for careful IED usage, which significantly minimizes civilian casualties (a specific strategic goal of PIRA) while increasing the ability to kill more high value targets with IEDs. Lethal counter-terrorism events also significantly affect a brigade's likelihood of killing both civilians and high-value targets but in different ways. Killing PIRA members significantly decreases IED fatalities but also significantly decreases the possibility of zero civilian IED-related deaths in a given year. Killing innocent Catholics in a Brigade's county significantly increases total and civilian IED fatalities. Together the results suggest the necessity to analyze dynamic situational variables that impact terrorist group behavior at the sub-unit level.",

The availability of family clusters in the data is leveraged to show that these results are robust to a sibling fixed-effects specification. The way that personality might interact with environmental influences in the development of ideology is also explored. A variety of childhood experiences are studied that may have a differential effect on political ideology based on a respondent's personality profile. Childhood trauma is found to interact with \"openness\" in predicting ideology, and this complex relationship is investigated using mediation analysis.

These bacteria use type 1 and P pili for host recognition and attachment. These pili are assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway of pilus biogenesis. Scope of review The review examines the biogenesis and adhesion of the UPEC type 1 and P pili. Particular emphasis is drawn to the role of the outer membrane usher protein. The structural properties of the complete pilus are also examined to highlight the strength and functionality of the final assembly. Major conclusions The usher orchestrates the sequential addition of pilus subunits in a defined order. This process follows a subunit-incorporation cycle which consists of four steps: recruitment at the usher N-terminal domain, donor-strand exchange with the previously assembled subunit, transfer to the usher C-terminal domains and translocation of the nascent pilus. Adhesion by the type 1 and P pili is strengthened by the quaternary structure of their rod sections. The rod is endowed with spring-like properties which provide mechanical resistance against urine flow. The distal adhesins operate differently from one another, targeting receptors in a specific manner. The biogenesis and adhesion of type 1 and P pili are being therapeutically targeted, and efforts to prevent pilus growth or adherence are described. General significance The combination of structural and biochemical study has led to the detailed mechanistic understanding of this membrane spanning nano-machine. This can now be exploited to design novel drugs able to inhibit virulence. This is vital in the present era of resurgent antibiotic resistance.

            "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.Pulmonary hypertension is associated with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although pulmonary vascular changes occur early in the course of the disease. Pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement (PAE) measured by computed tomography correlates with pulmonary hypertension and COPD exacerbation frequency. Genome-wide association studies of PAE in subjects with COPD have not been reported. To investigate whether genetic variants are associated with PAE within subjects with COPD, we investigated data from current and former smokers from the COPDGene Study and the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints study. The ratio of the diameter of the PA to the diameter of the aorta (A) was measured using computed tomography. PAE was defined as PA/A greater than 1. A genome-wide association study for COPD with PAE was performed using subjects with COPD without PAE (PA/A \u2264 1) as a control group. A secondary analysis used smokers with normal spirometry as a control group. Genotyping was performed on Illumina platforms. The results were summarized using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Both meta-analyses revealed a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 15q25.1 in IREB2 (COPD with versus without PAE, rs7181486; odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; P = 2.10 \u00d7 10-8; versus smoking control subjects, rs2009746; OR = 1.42; P = 1.32 \u00d7 10-9). PAE was also associated with a region on 14q31.3 near the GALC gene (rs7140285; OR = 1.55; P = 3.75 \u00d7 10-8). Genetic variants near IREB2 and GALC likely contribute to genetic susceptibility to PAE associated with COPD. This study provides evidence for genetic heterogeneity associated with a clinically important COPD vascular subtype.",

All rights reserved.Huntington disease is devastating to patients and their families - with autosomal dominant inheritance, onset typically in the prime of adult life, progressive course, and a combination of motor, cognitive and behavioural features. The disease is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat (of variable length) in HTT, the gene that encodes the protein huntingtin. In mutation carriers, huntingtin is produced with abnormally long polyglutamine sequences that confer toxic gains of function and predispose the protein to fragmentation, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. In this Primer, we review the epidemiology of Huntington disease, noting that prevalence is higher than previously thought, geographically variable and increasing. We describe the relationship between CAG repeat length and clinical phenotype, as well as the concept of genetic modifiers of the disease. We discuss normal huntingtin protein function, evidence for differential toxicity of mutant huntingtin variants, theories of huntingtin aggregation and the many different mechanisms of Huntington disease pathogenesis. We describe the genetic and clinical diagnosis of the condition, its clinical assessment and the multidisciplinary management of symptoms, given the absence of effective disease-modifying therapies. We review past and present clinical trials and therapeutic strategies under investigation, including impending trials of targeted huntingtin-lowering drugs and the progress in development of biomarkers that will support the next generation of trials.

Quantum spin Hall states are predicted to allow current flow at the edges of an insulating bulk, as demonstrated in various experiments. A key prediction yet to be experimentally verified is the breakdown of the edge conduction under broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we first establish a systematic framework for the magnetic field dependence of electrostatically gated quantum spin Hall devices. We then study edge conduction of an inverted quantum well device under broken time-reversal symmetry using microwave impedance microscopy, and compare our findings to a non-inverted device. At zero magnetic field, only the inverted device shows clear edge conduction in its local conductivity profile, consistent with theory. Surprisingly, the edge conduction persists up to 9 T with little change. This indicates physics beyond simple quantum spin Hall model, including material-specific properties and possibly many-body effects.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2015.Planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwave frequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. We use these data to characterize the frequency dependence of dust emission. We make use of the Planck 353 GHz I, Q, and U Stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with the Planck and WMAP data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz, over circular patches with 10\u00b0 radius. The cross-correlation analysis is performed for both intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. The results are corrected for the chance correlation between the templates and the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. We use a mask that focuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediate Galactic latitudes. We determine the spectral indices of dust emission in intensity and polarization between 100 and 353 GHz, for each sky patch. Both indices are found to be remarkably constant over the sky. The mean values, 1.59 \u00b1 0.02 for polarization and 1.51 \u00b1 0.01 for intensity, for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 K, are close, but significantly different (3.6\u03c3). We determine the mean spectral energy distribution (SED) of the microwave emission, correlated with the 353 GHz dust templates, by averaging the results of the correlation over all sky patches. We find that the mean SED increases for decreasing frequencies at \u03bd< 60 GHz for both intensity and polarization. The rise of the polarization SED towards low frequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated with dust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. We use a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and to characterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. The polarization fraction (p) of the dust emission decreases by (21 \u00b1 6)% from 353 to 70 GHz. We discuss this result within the context of existing dust models. The decrease in p could indicate differences in polarization efficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicate grains). Our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize the separation between Galactic and cosmological polarization.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.We present radio observations of the Moon between 35 and 80 MHz to demonstrate a novel technique of interferometrically measuring large-scale diffuse emission extending far beyond the primary beam (global signal) for the first time. In particular, we show that (i) the Moon appears as a negative-flux source at frequencies 35 < \u03bd < 80 MHz since it is 'colder' than the diffuse Galactic background it occults, (ii) using the (negative) flux of the lunar disc, we can reconstruct the spectrum of the diffuse Galactic emission with the lunar thermal emission as a reference, and (iii) that reflected RFI (radio-frequency interference) is concentrated at the centre of the lunar disc due to specular nature of reflection, and can be independently measured. Our RFI measurements show that (i) Moon-based Cosmic Dawn experiments must design for an Earth-isolation of better than 80 dB to achieve an RFI temperature <1 mK, (ii) Moon-reflected RFI contributes to a dipole temperature less than 20 mK for Earth-based Cosmic Dawn experiments, (iii) man-made satellite-reflected RFI temperature exceeds 20 mK if the aggregate scattering cross-section of visible satellites exceeds 175 m<sup>2</sup> at 800 km height, or 15 m<sup>2</sup> at 400 km height. Currently, our diffuse background spectrum is limited by sidelobe confusion on short baselines (10-15 per cent level). Further refinement of our technique may yield constraints on the redshifted global 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn (40 > z >12) and the Epoch of Reionization (12 > z>5).",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, The Author(s).In addition to motor functions, it has become clear that in humans the cerebellum plays a significant role in cognition too, through connections with associative areas in the cerebral cortex. Classical anatomy indicates that neo-cerebellar regions are connected with the contralateral cerebral cortex through the dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, red nucleus and ventrolateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anatomical existence of these connections has been demonstrated using virus retrograde transport techniques in monkeys and rats ex vivo. In this study, using advanced diffusion MRI tractography we show that it is possible to calculate streamlines to reconstruct the pathway connecting the cerebellar cortex with contralateral cerebral cortex in humans in vivo. Corresponding areas of the cerebellar and cerebral cortex encompassed similar proportion (about 80 %) of the tract, suggesting that the majority of streamlines passing through the superior cerebellar peduncle connect the cerebellar hemispheres through the ventrolateral thalamus with contralateral associative areas. This result demonstrates that this kind of tractography is a useful tool to map connections between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex and moreover could be used to support specific theories about the abnormal communication along these pathways in cognitive dysfunctions in pathologies ranging from dyslexia to autism.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013, Springer-Verlag London.Labial frenulums are sagittal fibrous folds of oral mucosa with a periosteal insertion that extend from the lips to the alveolar or gingival mucosa. Occasionally, they assume inadequate size or location and may lead to functional and esthetic limitations. The aim of the present study was to compare pre-, trans-, and postsurgical clinical parameters of labial frenectomies performed with conventional surgery and neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Forty individuals were assessed as a convenience sample and were divided into two groups according to the treatment: group 1 (G1), conventional surgery (n = 22), and G2, Nd:YAG laser surgery (n = 18). Clinical parameters such as frenulum insertion, location, bleeding, surgical time, suturing, preoperative fear, and postoperative discomfort/functional limitations were evaluated. All surgeries were performed by the same operator, and the level of fear, pain, and discomfort related to oral functions were assessed with a visual numeric scale. Most of the frenulums (90 %) were classified as papillary or transpapillary insertion. Preoperative fear was similar between groups (p = 0.593). All G2 patients did not require suture (p < 0.001), did not bleed during the procedure (p < 0.001), and had surgical time diminished (p < 0.001). No significant statistical difference regarding pain or oral function could be observed. Three individuals (7.5 %) experienced postsurgical complications. Nd:YAG laser frenectomies reduces transoperative bleeding, avoiding the need of suturing, and promotes a significant reduction of surgical time in comparison with conventional surgery. Therefore, further studies are necessary to provide a complete understanding and standardization of the technique as well as the expected clinical results.",

Unlike inflammatory hyperalgesia that has a protective role, allodynia has no obvious biological utility. Allodynia is associated with nerve damage in conditions such as diabetes, and is likely to become an increasing clinical problem. Unfortunately, the mechanistic basis of this enhanced sensitivity is incompletely understood. In this review, we describe evidence for the involvement of candidate mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo2 and their role in allodynia, as well as the peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms that have also been implicated in this form of pain. Specific treatments that block allodynia could be very useful if the cell and molecular basis of the condition could be determined. There are many potential mechanisms underlying this condition ranging from alterations in mechanotransduction and sensory neuron excitability to the actions of inflammatory mediators and wiring changes in the CNS. As with other pain conditions, it is likely that the range of redundant mechanisms that cause allodynia will make therapeutic intervention problematic.",

The response of these structures when subjected to cyclic loads, such as that induced by earthquakes, is strongly influenced by the bond properties between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. This paper describes the results of a testing campaign composed of seven unidirectional cyclic tests and one monotonic test performed on full-scale columns built with plain bars, without adequate reinforcement detailing for seismic demands. An additional unidirectional cyclic test was carried out on a specimen with deformed bars for reference. The influence of bond properties, a cold joint at the base, lapping of longitudinal reinforcing bars, amount of reinforcing steel, cross-section dimensions and imposed loading history (monotonic or cyclic) is discussed. Finally, a correction coefficient to the expressions of EC8-3 for the calculation of ultimate rotation capacity of columns with plain reinforcing bars is proposed.",

It theorises the nature of these streets, developing an analytical framework through which to investigate them through their four high street functions - physical fabric, exchange, movement and real estate - and the overarching question of management. It then explores the challenges and issues facing such streets in British cities before turning specifically to the London case. Through a complimentary set of empirical investigations, London's local high streets are explored across two scales, in terms of their strategic city-wide contribution, and through their local impact. They are examined both with regard to their situation today and their future potential. The policy context across London is also, explored, before conclusions and recommendations are drawn out of relevance to London and to mixed street corridors across the world. Mixed streets represent a particularly 'wicked' problem for cities, yet, as the research shows, they are also some of the most important spaces in the city, of far greater complexity and local significance than is realised, and possessing untapped strategic growth potential.",

Using data obtained on crime events from adult child sexual offenders incarcerated in Queensland (Australia), mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of potential guardianship on the severity of abuse. Controlling for victim and situational characteristics, the analyses showed that the presence of a potential guardian reduced the duration of sexual contact and the occurrence of penetration. Presence of a potential guardian decreased the risk of sexual penetration by 86%. The study highlights the importance of the presence of a potential guardian for reducing the severity of child sexual abuse, and suggests more broadly that guardianship may be an important protective factor in sexual offending.",

Of these, 16 were detected in at least two Planck frequencies. The radio-through-microwave spectral energy distributions were compiled to determine the mechanism for microwave emission. In only one case, IC 443, is there high-frequency emission clearly from dust associated with the supernova remnant. In all cases, the low-frequency emission is from synchrotron radiation. As predicted for a population of relativistic particles with energy distribution that extends continuously to high energies, a single power law is evident for many sources, including the Crab and PKS 1209-51/52. A decrease in flux density relative to the extrapolation of radio emission is evident in several sources. Their spectral energy distributions can be approximated as broken power laws, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd-\u03b1, with the spectral index, \u03b1, increasing by 0.5-1 above a break frequency in the range 10-60 GHz.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We present optical and ultraviolet (UV) photometry and spectra of the very nearby and highly reddened supernova (SN) 2014J in M82 obtained with the Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT). Comparison of the UVOT grism spectra of SN 2014J with Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN2011fe or UVOT grism spectra of SN 2012fr are consistent with an extinction law with a low value of RV \u223c1.4. The high reddening causes the detected photon distribution in the broadband UV filters to have a much longer effective wavelength than for an unreddened SN. The light curve evolution is consistent with this shift and does not show a flattening due to photons being scattered back into the line of sight (LOS). The light curve shapes and color evolution are inconsistent with a contribution scattered into the LOS by circumstellar dust. We conclude that most or all of the high reddening must come from interstellar dust. We show that even for a single dust composition, there is not a unique reddening law caused by circumstellar scattering. Rather, when considering scattering from a time-variable source, we confirm earlier studies that the reddening law is a function of the dust geometry, column density, and epoch. We also show how an assumed geometry of dust as a foreground sheet in mixed stellar/dust systems will lead to a higher inferred RV. Rather than assuming the dust around SNe is peculiar, SNe may be useful probes of the interstellar reddening laws in other galaxies.",

We used repetitive TMS to temporarily disrupt neural information processing in two anatomical fields of the IPL, namely, the angular (ANG) and supramarginal (SMG) gyri, and observed the effects on reading tasks that focused attention on either themeaning or sounds of written words. Relative to no TMS, stimulation of the left ANG selectively slowed responses in the meaning, but not sound, task, whereas stimulation of the left SMG affected responses in the sound, but not meaning, task. These results demonstrate that ANG and SMG doubly dissociate in their contributions to visual word recognition. We suggest that this functional division of labor may be understood in terms of the distinct patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity resulting in separable functional circuits.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Successful choice under risk requires the integration of information about outcome probabilities and values and implicates a brain network including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (pPAR). Damage to the vmPFC is linked to poor decision-making and increased risk-taking. Electrophysiological and neuroimaging data implicate the pPAR in the processing of reward probability during choice, but the causal contribution of this area has not been established. We compared patients with lesions to the pPAR (n = 13), vmPFC (n = 13), and healthy volunteers (n = 22) on the Roulette Betting Task, a measure of risk-sensitive decision-making. Both lesion groups were impaired in adjusting their bets to the probability of winning. This impairment was correlated with the extent of pPAR, but not vmPFC, damage. In addition, the vmPFC group chose higher bets than healthy controls overall, an effect that correlated with lesion volume in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Both lesion groups earned fewer points than healthy controls. The groups did not differ on 2 tasks assessing probabilistic reasoning outside of a risk-reward context. Our results demonstrate the causal involvement of both the pPAR and vmPFC in risk-sensitive choice and indicate distinguishable roles of these areas in probability processing and risk appetite.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014, IPNA.Hyperphosphatemia is a serious complication of late-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen in this patient group. Results from retrospective studies suggest that small increases in serum phosphate concentration, within the normal or near-normal range, also correlate with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and have led to the suggestion that detection and preventative treatment of positive phosphate balance is important in healthy individuals as well as in those with CKD. Phosphate homeostasis is maintained by the crosstalk between intestinal phosphate absorption and renal phosphate excretion; however, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of intestinal phosphate transport. Our current understanding is that the intestinal type II sodium phosphate cotransporter, NaPi-IIb, plays a significant role in absorption. It may also be involved in the sensing of dietary phosphate composition and the release of hormonal factors that modulate renal phosphate reabsorption to achieve phosphate balance. Interestingly, studies using NaPi-IIb knockout mice with adenine-induced CKD show only partial attenuation of hyperphosphatemia, suggesting that an additional sodium-independent pathway is involved in phosphate absorption. The aim of this review is to discuss our current knowledge of the processes and role of the intestine in phosphate homeostasis and to provide evidence that this organ could be targeted for the treatment of hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphatemia.",

            "Abstract": "Based on a multilevel and quantile hedonic analysis regarding the local public bus system and the prices of residential properties in Cardiff, Wales, we find strong evidence to support two research hypotheses: (a) the number of bus stops within walking distance (300-1500. m) to a property is positively associated with the property's observed sale price, and (b) properties of higher market prices, compared with their cheaper counterparts, tend to benefit more from spatial proximity to the bus stop locations. Given these statistical findings, we argue that, land value tax (LVT), albeit a classic political idea dating back to the early 20th century, does have contemporary relevance and, with modern geographic information technologies, can be rigorously analysed and empirically justified with a view to actual implementation. Levying LVT will not only generate additional fiscal revenues to help finance the development and maintenance of local public infrastructures, but will also ensure a more just distribution of the economic welfare yielded by public investment. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Whether criteria for MCI are applicable in the context of stroke and can be used to predict dementia in stroke cases is not known.OBJECTIVES: to determine the prevalence of MCI in individuals with stroke and identify predictors of 2-year incident dementia in stroke cases.METHODS: individuals were from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. MCI prevalence in individuals with stroke was determined. Logistic regression, with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, was used to identify variables associated with risk of dementia in stroke cases including MCI criteria, demographic, health and lifestyle variables.FINDINGS: of 2,640 individuals seen at the first assessment, 199 reported stroke with no dementia. In individuals with stroke, criteria for MCI are not appropriate, with less than 1% of stroke cases being classified as having MCI. However, in individuals with stroke two components of the MCI definition, subjective memory complaint and cognitive function (memory and praxis scores) predicted 2-year incident dementia (area under the curve = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.77-0.94, n = 113).CONCLUSION: criteria for MCI do not appear to capture risk of dementia in the context of stroke in the population. In stroke cases, subjective and objective cognitive performance predicts dementia and these variables could possibly be incorporated into dementia risk models for stroke cases. Identifying individuals with stroke at greatest risk of dementia has important implications for treatment and intervention.",

(Int J Eat Disord 2015; 48:383-391) \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Objective To investigate which parental mental illnesses are associated with eating disorders in their offspring. Method We used data from a record-linkage cohort study of 158,679 children aged 12-24 years at the end of follow-up, resident in Stockholm County from 2001 to 2007, to investigate whether different parental mental illnesses are risk factors for eating disorders in their offspring. The outcome measure was diagnosis of any eating disorder, either from an ICD or DSM-IV code, or inferred from an appointment at a specialist eating disorder clinic. Results Mental illness in parents is a risk factor for eating disorders in female offspring (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) 1.57 (95% CI 1.42, 1.92), p < 0.0001). Risk of eating disorders is increased if there is a parental diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (AHR 2.28 (95% CI 1.39, 3.72), p = 0.004), personality disorder (AHR 1.57 (95% CI 1.01, 2.44), p = 0.043) or anxiety/depression (AHR 1.57 (95% CI 1.32, 1.86), p < 0.0001). There is a lack of statistical evidence for an association with parental schizophrenia (AHR 1.41 (95% CI 0.96, 2.07), p = 0.08), and somatoform disorder (AHR 1.25 (95% CI 0.74, 2.13), p = 0.40). There is no support for a relationship between parental substance misuse and eating disorders in children (AHR 1.08 (95% CI 0.82, 1.43), p = 0.57). Discussion Parental mental illness, specifically parental anxiety, depression, bipolar affective disorder, and personality disorders, are risk factors for eating disorders in their offspring.",

Journal of Viral Hepatitis Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Viral hepatitis is responsible for great health, social and economic burden both globally and in the UK. This study aimed to assess the research funding awarded to UK institutions for viral hepatitis research and the relationship of funded research to clinical and public health burden of viral hepatitis. Databases and websites were systematically searched for information on infectious disease research studies funded for the period 1997-2010. Studies specifically related to viral hepatitis research were identified and categorized in terms of funding by pathogen, disease and by a research and development value chain describing the type of science. The overall data set included 6165 studies (total investment \u00a32.6 billion) of which \u00a376.9 million (3.0%) was directed towards viral hepatitis across 323 studies (5.2%). By pathogen, there were four studies specifically investigating hepatitis A (\u00a33.8 million), 69 studies for hepatitis B (21.4%) with total investment of \u00a314.7 million (19.1%) and 236 (73.1%) hepatitis C studies (\u00a362.7 million, 81.5%). There were 4 studies investigating hepatitis G, and none specifying hepatitis D or E. By associated area, viral hepatitis and therapeutics research received \u00a317.0 million, vaccinology \u00a33.1 million and diagnostics \u00a32.9 million. Preclinical research received \u00a350.3 million (65.4%) across 173 studies, whilst implementation and operational research received \u00a319.4 million (25.3%) across 128 studies. The UK is engaged in much hepatology research, but there are areas where the burden is great and may require greater focus, such as hepatitis E, development of a vaccine for hepatitis C, and further research into hepatitis-associated cancers. Private sector data, and funding information from other countries, would also be useful in priority setting.",

The toolkit provides the option of execution on fast graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, numerous constitutive models and solid-element options, membrane and shell elements, and contact modelling facilities, in a simple to use library. Methods: The toolkit is founded on the total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLEDs) algorithm, which has been shown to be efficient and accurate for simulation of soft tissues. The base code is written in C$$++$$++, and GPU execution is achieved using the nVidia CUDA framework. In most cases, interaction with the underlying solvers can be achieved through a single Simulator class, which may be embedded directly in third-party applications such as, surgical guidance systems. Advanced capabilities such as contact modelling and nonlinear constitutive models are also provided, as are more experimental technologies like reduced order modelling. A consistent description of the underlying solution algorithm, its implementation with a focus on GPU execution, and examples of the toolkit\u2019s usage in biomedical applications are provided. Results: Efficient mapping of the TLED algorithm to parallel hardware results in very high computational performance, far exceeding that available in commercial packages. Conclusion: The NiftySim toolkit provides high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities using GPU technology for biomechanical simulation research applications in medical image computing, surgical simulation, and surgical guidance applications.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 IEEE.Video-based object or face recognition services on mobile devices have recently garnered significant attention, given that video cameras are now ubiquitous in all mobile communication devices. In one of the most typical scenarios for such services, each mobile device captures and transmits video frames over wireless to a remote computing cluster (a.k.a. \"cloud\" computing infrastructure) that performs the heavy-duty video feature extraction and recognition tasks for a large number of mobile devices. A major challenge of such scenarios stems from the highly varying contention levels in the wireless transmission, as well as the variation in the task-scheduling congestion in the cloud. In order for each device to adapt the transmission, feature extraction and search parameters and maximize its object or face recognition rate under such contention and congestion variability, we propose a systematic learning framework based on multi-user multi-armed bandits. The performance loss under two instantiations of the proposed framework is characterized by the derivation of upper bounds for the achievable short-term and long-term loss in the expected recognition rate per face recognition attempt against the \"oracle\" solution that assumes a-priori knowledge of the system performance under every possible setting. Unlike well-known reinforcement learning techniques that exhibit very slow convergence when operating in highly-dynamic environments, the proposed bandit-based systematic learning quickly approaches the optimal transmission and cloud resource allocation policies based on feedback on the experienced dynamics (contention and congestion levels). To validate our approach, time-constrained simulation results are presented via: (i) contention-based H.264/AVC video streaming over IEEE 802.11 WLANs and (ii) principal-component based face recognition algorithms running under varying congestion levels of a cloud-computing infrastructure. Against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods, our framework is shown to provide 17.8% \u223c 44.5% reduction of the number of video frames that must be processed by the cloud for recognition and 11.5% \u223c 36.5% reduction in the video traffic over the WLAN.",

All rights reserved.Following the discovery of a higher than expected incidence of Parkinson Disease (PD) in Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder, mutations in the glucocerebrocidase (GBA) gene, which encodes a lysosomal enzyme involved in sphingolipid degradation were explored in the context of idiopathic PD. GBA mutations are now known to be the single largest risk factor for development of idiopathic PD. Clinically, on imaging and pharmacologically, GBA PD is almost identical to idiopathic PD, other than certain features that can be identified in the specialist research setting but not in routine clinical practice. In patients with a known GBA mutation, it is possible to monitor for prodromal signs of PD. The clinical similarity with idiopathic PD and the chance to identify PD at a pre-clinical stage provides a unique opportunity to research therapeutic options for early PD, before major irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms which lead to this increased PD risk in GBA mutation carriers are not fully elucidated. Experimental models to define the molecular mechanisms and test therapeutic options include cell culture, transgenic mice and other in vivo models amenable to genetic manipulation, such as drosophilia. Some key pathological pathways of interest in the context of GBA mutations include alpha synuclein aggregation, lysosomal-autophagy axis changes and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Therapeutic agents that exploit these pathways are being developed and include the small molecule chaperone Ambroxol. This review aims to summarise the main features of GBA-PD and provide insights into the pathological relevance of GBA mutations on molecular pathways and the therapeutic implications for PD resulting from investigation of the role of GBA in PD.",

BJU International \u00a9 2014 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective To compare the performance of three continence management devices and absorbent pads used by men with persistent urinary incontinence (>1 year) after treatment for prostate cancer. Patients and Methods Randomised, controlled trial of 56 men with 1-year follow-up. Three devices were tested for 3 weeks each: sheath drainage system, body-worn urinal (BWU) and penile clamp. Device and pad performance were assessed. Quality of life (QoL) was measured at baseline and follow-up with the King's Health Questionnaire. Stated (intended use) and revealed (actual use) preference for products were assessed. Value-for-money was gathered. Results Substantial and significant differences in performance were found. The sheath was rated as 'good' for extended use (e.g. golf and travel) when pad changing is difficult; for keeping skin dry, not leaking, not smelling and convenient for storage and travel. The BWU was generally rated worse than the sheath and was mainly used for similar activities but by men who could not use a sheath (e.g. retracted penis) and was not good for seated activities. The clamp was good for short vigorous activities like swimming/exercise; it was the most secure, least likely to leak, most discreet but almost all men described it as uncomfortable or painful. The pads were good for everyday activities and best for night-time use; most easy to use, comfortable when dry but most likely to leak and most uncomfortable when wet. There was a preference for having a mixture of products to meet daytime needs; around two-thirds of men were using a combination of pads and devices after testing compared with baseline. Conclusions This is the first trial to systematically compare different continence management devices for men. Pads and devices have different strengths, which make them particularly suited to certain circumstances and activities. Most men prefer to use pads at night but would choose a mixture of pads and devices during the day. Device limitations were important but may be overcome by better design.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Dietetic Association.Background: The present study aimed to explore parental perceptions of overweight children and associated health risks after receiving National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) weight feedback. Methods: Fifty-two parents of overweight and obese children aged 4-5 years and 10-11 years enrolled in the NCMP programme in England in 2010-2011 participated in qualitative, semi-structured interviews about their perceptions of their child's weight and health risk after receiving weight feedback. Interviews were audio tape recorded and were conducted either by telephone (n = 9) or in the respondents' homes (n = 41). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative thematic analysis. Results: Parents who received NCMP written feedback informing them that their child was overweight disregarded the results because they viewed 'health and happiness as being more important than weight'. The feedback was viewed as less credible because it did not consider the individual child's lifestyle. 'Broad definitions of healthy' were described that did not include weight, such as reference to the child having good emotional and physical health and a healthy diet. Parents attributed weight to 'inherited/acquired factors' such as genetics or puppy fat, or did not regard their child's 'appearance' as reflecting being overweight. 'Cultural influence' also meant that being overweight was not viewed negatively by some non-white parents. Conclusions: After receiving written weight feedback, parents use methods other than actual weight when evaluating their child's weight status and health risks. Parents' conceptions of health and weight should be considered when communicating with parents, with the aim of bridging the gap between parental recognition of being overweight and subsequent behaviour change.

The response of these structures when loaded cyclically, as occurs during the earthquakes, is partially controlled by the bond properties between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign of unidirectional cyclic tests carried out on six full-scale beam-column joints built with plain bars. These joint specimens are representative of existing reinforced concrete structures, that is, built without adequate reinforcement detailing for seismic demands. For comparison, an additional specimen is built with deformed bars and tested. The seven specimens are designed and detailed to allow the investigation of the influence of bond properties, lapping of the longitudinal bars in columns and beams, bent-up bars in the beams, slab contribution and concrete strength. The lateral force-drift relationships, global dissipated energy evolution, contribution of the joint, beams and columns to the global dissipated energy, ductility, equivalent damping, final damage observed, homogenized reinforced concrete damage index, displacement components, curvature evolutions and Eurocode requirements are presented and discussed.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.All developing organs need to be connected to both the nervous system (for sensory and motor control) as well as the vascular system (for gas exchange, fluid and nutrient supply). Consequently both the nervous and vascular systems develop alongside each other and share striking similarities in their branching architecture. Here we report embryonic manipulations that allow us to study the simultaneous development of neural crest-derived nervous tissue (in this case the enteric nervous system), and the vascular system. This is achieved by generating chicken chimeras via transplantation of discrete segments of the neural tube, and associated neural crest, combined with vascular DiI injection in the same embryo. Our method uses transgenic chickGFP embryos for intraspecies grafting, making the transplant technique more powerful than the classical quail-chick interspecies grafting protocol used with great effect since the 1970s. ChickGFP-chick intraspecies grafting facilitates imaging of transplanted cells and their projections in intact tissues, and eliminates any potential bias in cell development linked to species differences. This method takes full advantage of the ease of access of the avian embryo (compared with other vertebrate embryos) to study the co-development of the enteric nervous system and the vascular system.",

Such abuse experiences are usually associated with marked distress, impairments in mental health, social and academic functioning. There are also physical changes including alterations in brain structure and an impact of chronic stress on inflammatory responses associated with physical health impairments. Awareness of such physical effects further adds to the importance of prompt recognition of maltreatment, effective treatment of its sequelae, and above all primary prevention.

The main disaster-producing agents are reviewed systematically in terms of geophysical processes and effects, monitoring, mitigation and warning. The relationship between disasters and society is examined with respect to a wide variety of themes, including damage assessment and prevention, hazard mapping, emergency preparedness, the provision of shelter and the nature of reconstruction. Medical emergencies and the epidemiology of disasters are described, and refugee management and aid to the Third World are discussed. A chapter is devoted to the sociology, psychology, economics and history of disasters.; In many parts of the world the toll of death, injury, damage and deprivation caused by natural disasters is becoming increasingly serious. Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods and other similar catastrophes are often followed by large relief operations characterized by substantial involvement of the international community. The years 1990-2000 have therefore been designated by the United Nations as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.; The book goes beyond mere description and elevates the field of natural catastrophes to a serious academic level. The author's insights and perspectives are also informed by his practical experience of being a disaster victim and survivor, and hence the unique perspective of a participant observer. Only by surmounting the boundaries between disciplines can natural catastrophe be understood and mitigation efforts made effective. Thus, this book is perhaps the first completely interdisciplinary, fully comprehensive survey of natural hazards and disasters. It has a clear theoretical basis and it recognizes the importance of six fundamental approaches to the field, which it blends carefully in the text in order to avoid the p.",

The obtained measurements were compared with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Society of Light and Lighting.Results: Recordings were within recommended levels for light and humidity overnight. Average noise levels were above the recommended levels. There were abrupt increases of light and noise levels which were high enough to cause sleep fragmentation. Mean temperature levels were higher than recommended.Conclusions: Our results indicated that the patients are at risk of disturbed sleep for the duration of their stay in rehabilitation unit. Exposure to generally high noise levels, as well as the sudden increases of noise and light intensities can prevent reaching restful night-time sleep and may negatively impact on rehabilitation process due to impaired memory, learning and well-being.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.Background: Telomere length is a putative biomarker of ageing, morbidity and mortality. Its application is hampered by lack of widely applicable reference ranges and uncertainty regarding the present limits of measurement reproducibility within and between laboratories. Methods: We instigated an international collaborative study of telomere length assessment: 10 different laboratories, employing 3 different techniques [Southern blotting, single telomere length analysis (STELA) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)] performed two rounds of fully blinded measurements on 10 human DNA samples per round to enable unbiased assessment of intra- and inter-batch variation between laboratories and techniques. Results: Absolute results from different laboratories differed widely and could thus not be compared directly, but rankings of relative telomere lengths were highly correlated (correlation coefficients of 0.63-0.99). Intra-technique correlations were similar for Southern blotting and qPCR and were stronger than inter-technique ones. However, inter-laboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) averaged about 10% for Southern blotting and STELA and more than 20% for qPCR. This difference was compensated for by a higher dynamic range for the qPCR method as shown by equal variance after z-scoring. Technical variation per laboratory, measured as median of intra- and inter-batch CVs, ranged from 1.4% to 9.5%, with differences between laboratories only marginally significant (P = 0.06). Gel-based and PCR-based techniques were not different in accuracy. Conclusions: Intra- and inter-laboratory technical variation severely limits the usefulness of data pooling and excludes sharing of reference ranges between laboratories. We propose to establish a common set of physical telomere length standards to improve comparability of telomere length estimates between laboratories.",

The Introduction considers this interplay from the standpoint of classical scholarship, and suggests that a renewed engagement with philosophical thought on tragedy could be especially important as a means of mediating between the transhistorical focus of reception studies and the historicizing tendencies of traditional scholarship. Looking beyond the figures who have most dominated discussions of the tragic, Hegel and Nietzsche, the volume concentrates on three areas in particular: the persistence of questions associated with poetics, the cultural politics of tragedy, and the impact of canons on thinking about tragedy.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center.Paranoia is receiving increasing attention in its own right, since it is a central experience of psychotic disorders and a marker of the health of a society. Paranoia is associated with use of the most commonly taken illicit drug, cannabis. The objective was to determine whether the principal psychoactive ingredient of cannabis - \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - causes paranoia and to use the drug as a probe to identify key cognitive mechanisms underlying paranoia. A randomized, placebo-controlled, between-groups test of the effects of intravenous THC was conducted. A total of 121 individuals with paranoid ideation were randomized to receive placebo, THC, or THC preceded by a cognitive awareness condition. Paranoia was assessed extensively via a real social situation, an immersive virtual reality experiment, and standard self-report and interviewer measures. Putative causal factors were assessed. Principal components analysis was used to create a composite paranoia score and composite causal variables to be tested in a mediation analysis. THC significantly increased paranoia, negative affect (anxiety, worry, depression, negative thoughts about the self), and a range of anomalous experiences, and reduced working memory capacity. The increase in negative affect and in anomalous experiences fully accounted for the increase in paranoia. Working memory changes did not lead to paranoia. Making participants aware of the effects of THC had little impact. In this largest study of intravenous THC, it was definitively demonstrated that the drug triggers paranoid thoughts in vulnerable individuals. The most likely mechanism of action causing paranoia was the generation of negative affect and anomalous experiences.",

Aims: To systematically review the literature for interventions intended to increase the detection of dementia or suspected dementia or people presenting with memory complaints. Method: We searched electronic databases, hand searched references and contacted authors of included papers, contacted field experts and UK charities and councils for data about their dementia awareness programmes. Results: We included 13 studies, of which four were randomised controlled trials (RCT). Two RCTs found that general practitioner (GP) education increased suspected dementia cases. One RCT found up to six home visits from a specialist geriatric nurse over 30 months increased the rate of accurately diagnosed dementia. There was preliminary evidence from non-randomised studies that memory clinics increase timely diagnosis, but no evidence they increase the overall diagnosis rate. Conclusions: There is good quality evidence that GP education increases the number of suspected dementia cases but not accurate or earlier dementia diagnoses. One RCT reported that multiple visits from a trained nurse increase the diagnosis rate. There is no cost effectiveness evidence. Our findings suggest good quality RCTs are needed to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase dementia detection.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 MENCAP.Background: Studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are aware of stigma and are able to describe experiences of being treated negatively. However, there have been no cross-cultural studies examining whether self-reported experiences of stigma vary between ethnic groups. Method: Participants with mild and moderate ID were recruited from a number of different settings in Cape Town, South Africa. Self-reported experiences of stigma in three ethnic groups were measured using the South African version of the Perceived Stigma of Intellectual Disability tool, developed by the authors. One-way anova was used to test whether there were differences in the total stigma score between the ethnic groups. Regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with stigma. Results: A total of 191 participants agreed to take part; 53 were Black, 70 were of mixed ethnicity and 68 were Caucasian. There were no differences in the levels of stigma reported by the three groups but the Black African ethnic group were more likely to report being physically attacked and being stared at, but were also more likely to report that they thought they were 'the same as other people'. There was an interaction effect between ethnicity and level of ID, with participants with mild ID from the Black African group reporting higher levels of stigma compared with those with moderate ID. Younger age was the only factor that was associated with stigma but there was a trend towards ethnicity, additional disability and socio-economic status being related to stigma. Conclusion: Interventions should target the Black African community in South Africa and should include the reduction of both public stigma and self-reported stigma.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Platelet responsiveness to aspirin in people with cerebrovascular disease is poorly understood. Objectives: To determine: (i) normal reference range, imprecision and reproducibility of the Multiplate instrument in healthy volunteers naive to aspirin; (ii) imprecision and reproducibility of the Multiplate instrument in acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA); (iii) the relationship between aspirin responsiveness and clinical outcome. Materials and Methods: We evaluated platelet function response to three agonists [Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), Arachidonic Acid (AA), Collagen (Col)] using the Mulitplate platelet function analyser in a two-phase pilot study. In phase 1, we recruited healthy volunteers to determine the normal reference range and imprecision of the Multiplate instrument. In phase 2, we assessed platelet function in acute stroke or TIA patients presenting to hospital. These patients were bled within 24 h of presentation and between 12 and 24 h after \u226575 mg dose of Aspirin. Patients were followed up to 1 yr to assess mortality and recurrent cardiovascular event. Results: Overall, 29 healthy volunteers and 81 stroke/TIA patients were recruited. On assessing components of variance, Multiplate testing is reproducible and precise in volunteers and stroke/TIA patients. In stroke patients receiving aspirin, Bland-Altman plots show initial day 1 measurement provided a reliable measure of continuing response to aspirin at day 3. We defined one-third of patients as aspirin resistant [31.8% (95% CI: 22.1%-42.8%)] using cut off mean aggregation of \u226523.08% for AA and mean aggregation of \u226580.76% for ADP. Conclusion: The Multiplate device gives reproducible, precise results in volunteers and stroke/TIA patients.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors.The hypothesis of a universal initialmass function (IMF) -motivated by observations in nearby stellar systems - has been recently challenged by the discovery of a systematic variation of the IMF with the central velocity dispersion, \u03c3, of early-type galaxies (ETGs), towards an excess of low-mass stars in high-\u03c3 galaxies. This trend has been derived so far from integrated spectra, and remains unexplained at present. To test whether such trend depends on the local properties within a galaxy, we have obtained new, extremely deep, spectroscopic data, for three nearby ETGs, two galaxies with high \u03c3 (\u223c 300 km s-1), and one lower mass system, with \u03c3 \u223c 100 km s-1. From the analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral features, we find that the IMF depends significantly on galactocentric distance in the massive ETGs, with the enhanced fraction of low-mass stars mostly confined to their central regions. In contrast, the low-\u03c3 galaxy does not show any significant radial gradient in the IMF, well described by a shallower distribution, relative to the innermost regions of massive galaxies, at all radii. Such a result indicates that the IMF should be regarded as a local (rather than global) property, and suggests a significant difference between the formation process of the core and the outer regions of massive ETGs.",

Method Cross-sectional survey using a webbased questionnaire. Setting UK specialist paediatric palliative care services. Participants Volunteer managers/coordinators from all UK hospice providers (n=37) and one National Health Service palliative care service involving volunteers (covering 53 services in total). Main outcomes Service characteristics, number of volunteers, extent of volunteer involvement in care services, use of volunteers' professional skills and volunteer activities by setting. Results A total of 21 providers covering 31 hospices/palliative care services responded (30 evaluable responses). Referral age limit was 16-19 years in 23 services and 23-35 years in seven services; three services were Hospice at Home or home care only. Per service, there was a median of 25 volunteers with direct patient/family contact. Services providing only home care involved fewer volunteers than hospices with beds. Volunteers entirely ran some services, notably complementary therapy and pastoral/faith-based care. Complementary therapists, school teachers and spiritual care workers most commonly volunteered their professional skills. Volunteers undertook a wide range of activities including emotional support and recreational activities with children and siblings. Conclusions This is the most detailed national survey of volunteer activity in palliative care services for children and young people to date. It highlights the range and depth of volunteers' contribution to specialist paediatric palliative care services and will help to provide a basis for future research, which could inform expansion of volunteers' roles.",

However, the epidemiology of symptomatic VDD is largely undetermined; existing studies are limited to local case series, and national incidence estimates of disease burden are lacking. Objective: To estimate the incidence of hypocalcaemic seizures secondary to VDD in children in the UK and Ireland, and describe the demographic and clinical features of cases. Design and Setting: Prospective, population-based active surveillance study using the established British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) methodology. Population: Children aged 0-15 years, resident in the UK and Ireland, who developed a hypocalcaemic seizure due to VDD between September 2011 and September 2013. Main Outcome Measure: Overall incidence of hypocalcaemic seizures due to VDD in children age 0-15, and incidence stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity. Results: Ninety one confirmed or probable cases were reported, equating to an overall annual incidence of 3.49 per million children age 0-15 years (95% CI: 2.81-4.26). Incidence was significantly greater in males compared to females, in infants compared to older children, and in children of South Asian or Black ethnicity compared to children from white ethnic backgrounds. Conclusions: Current implementation of public health policy in the UK is not successful in preventing children from developing one of the severe manifestations of VDD. Further studies are required to evaluate the epidemiology of symptomatic VDD more broadly in order to guide future public health policy decisions.",

This study evaluated predictors of vocational activity for first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients during the first year of EIS care. It was hypothesized that longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and minority ethnic status would predict poorer vocational outcomes, whereas a history of good vocational functioning would predict better vocational functioning during follow up. Methods: FEP patients aged 14-35 years, who presented to seven EIS in London, UK, between 2003 and 2010, were followed for 1 year. Sociodemographic, clinical and vocational information (qualifications obtained and paid employment) were collected using the MiData audit tool at entry to EIS and 1 year later. Results: Approximately one-third of patients (n=345/1013) were studying or employed at some point during the first year of EIS care. Baseline vocational activity was the strongest predictor of vocational functioning during 1 year of follow up. Moreover, employment prior to entry into EIS strongly predicted change in vocational activity during 1 year of follow up. Individuals with DUP <6 months or of Asian or black African origin were more likely to be studying than their white British counterparts. Conclusion: This study confirms that a significant proportion of FEP patients are able to engage in meaningful vocational activities even within the first year of EIS care. However, services need to focus more resources on getting patients with poor educational or employment histories into training programmes to improve their vocational outcomes.",

RP2 patients frequently present with nonsense mutations and no treatments are currently available to restore RP2 function. In this study, we reprogrammed fibroblasts from an RP2 patient carrying the nonsense mutation c.519C>T (p.R120X) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and differentiated these cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) to study the mechanisms of disease and test potential therapies. RP2 protein was undetectable in the RP2 R120X patient cells, suggesting a disease mechanism caused by complete lack of RP2 protein. The RP2 patient fibroblasts and iPSC-derived RPE cells showed phenotypic defects in IFT20 localization, Golgi cohesion and G\u03b21 trafficking. These phenotypes were corrected by over-expressing GFP-tagged RP2. Using the translational read-through inducing drugs (TRIDs) G418 and PTC124 (Ataluren), we were able to restore up to 20% of endogenous, full-length RP2 protein in R120X cells. This level of restored RP2 was sufficient to reverse the cellular phenotypic defects observed in both the R120X patient fibroblasts and iPSC-RPE cells. This is the first proof-of-concept study to demonstrate successful read-through and restoration of RP2 function for the R120X nonsense mutation. The ability of the restored RP2 protein level to reverse the observed cellular phenotypes in cells lacking RP2 indicates that translational read-through could be clinically beneficial for patients.",

Insect Conservation and Diversity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Entomological Society.This study investigated the effects of plant diversity, habitat type and landscape structure on the functional diversity of the carabid assemblages in the agro-landscape of the North China Plain. We hypothesise (i) small, herbivorous and omnivorous carabids are more strongly affected by local plant diversity, while large and predatory carabids are strongly affected by landscape structure, and (ii) habitat type influences the diversity across functional groups. In 2010, carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall traps in six typical habitats of the agro-landscape: wheat/maize fields, peanut fields, orchards, field margins, windbreaks and woodland. Our results showed that (i) habitat type played a predominant role in driving the changes in the diversity of carabid assemblages, followed by local plant diversity while the landscape structure had little effect; (ii) small and omnivorous carabid were strongly affected by local plant diversity, while the composition of large and predatory carabid was strongly associated with the landscape structure; and (iii) habitats dominated by woody species harboured different assemblages to habitats dominated by herbaceous plants for overall carabids and three functional groups excluding omnivorous beetles. Informed by our results, we suggest the differentiated responses between functional groups should be appreciated in conservation management. In the intensively managed agro-landscape, maintenance of diverse habitats and creating a more complex vegetation structure would be the most efficient measures to enhance the diversity of carabid assemblages. Particularly, the maintenance of extensively managed habitats coupled with a targeted increase in the local plant diversity is crucial to optimise the biological pest control by carabid assemblages.",

The emphasis is on the job insecurity generated by the process, and explanations for observed effects on health and well-being are sought in changes in other characteristics of the psychosocial work environment, health-related behaviors and individual differences. Causation always remains a matter of belief or judgment based on all the available evidence. However, it is rare for the evidence on causation to be as unequivocal as that for cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Thus, there comes a point at which it becomes prudent to act on the premise that a causal relationship exists, rather than await further evidence.",

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.Background Psychoeducation is an essential component of postdiagnostic care for people with ASD (autism spectrum disorder), but there is currently no evidence base for clinical practice. We designed, manualised and evaluated PEGASUS (psychoeducation group for autism spectrum understanding and support), a group psychoeducational programme aiming to enhance the self-awareness of young people with ASD by teaching them about their diagnosis. Methods This single-blind RCT (randomised control trial) involved 48 young people (9-14 years) with high-functioning ASD. Half were randomly assigned to PEGASUS, administered in six weekly group sessions, with the others receiving no additional intervention. ASD-related self-awareness, the primary outcome, was evaluated using the bespoke Autism Knowledge Quiz (AKQ). Secondary outcome measures included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. All measures were collected during home visits and scored by researchers blind to group assignment. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials (NCT01187940, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and was funded by the Baily Thomas Charitable Trust. Results Bootstrap multiple regression showed ASD knowledge (\u03b2 =.29, p <.001, 95% CIs [0.13, 0.44]) and ASD self-awareness (\u03b2 =.42, p =.001, 95% CIs [0.17, 0.67]), measured by number of ASD-related personal strengths and difficulties listed by participants, increased for those who attended PEGASUS (n = 24) compared with controls (n = 24). There was no effect of PEGASUS on self-esteem by self-report (\u03b2 =.10, p =.404, 95% CIs [-0.14, 0.35]) or parent report (\u03b2 =.12, p =.324, 95% CIs [-0.12, 0.36]). Conclusions After PEGASUS, participants had more general knowledge about ASD, and showed a greater awareness of their collection of unique strengths and difficulties associated with ASD. Psychoeducation did not lower self-esteem. This RCT provides initial evidence for PEGASUS's efficacy as a psychoeducation programme for people with ASD.",

To identify the functional anatomy of the RHI, we used multichannel EEG, acquired under three conditions of tactile stimulation. Evoked potentials were averaged from EEG signals registered to the timing of brushstrokes to the participant\u02bcs hand. The participant \u02bcs hand was stroked either in the absence of an artificial hand (REAL) or synchronously with an artificial hand, which either lay in an anatomically plausible (CONGRUENT) or impossible (INCONGRUENT) position. The illusion was reliably elicited in the CONGRUENT condition. For right-hand stimulation, significant differences between conditions emerged at the sensor level around 55 msec after the brushstroke at left frontal and right parietal electrodes. Response amplitudes were smaller for illusory (CONGRUENT) compared with nonillusory (INCONGRUENT and REAL) conditions in the contralateral perirolandic region (pre- and postcentral gyri), superior and inferior parietal lobule, whereas veridical perception of the artificial hand (INCONGRUENT) amplified responses at a scalp region overlying the contralateral postcentral gyrus and inferior parietal lobule compared with the remaining two conditions. Left-hand stimulation produced similar contralateral patterns. These results are consistent with predictive coding models of multisensory integration and may reflect the attenuation of somatosensory precision that is required to resolve perceptual hypotheses about conflicting multisensory input.",

Fungal sinusitis represents a wide spectrum of disorders, including acute or chronic and invasive or non-invasive forms. Invasive fungal sinusitis may develop in an immunocompromised or diabetic patient, whereas non-invasive fungal sinusitis should be considered in a chronic situation, resistant to antibiotics in immunocompetent patients. Allergic fungal sinusitis is related to hypersensitivity of the host to the fungus. The diagnosis of these infections requires radiological examination and endoscopy with mucosal biopsies examined histologically and mycologically in order to distinguish the different types of sinusitis. In the non-invasive forms, surgical treatment is essential, sometimes combined with antifungal and anti-inflammatory treatment. The invasive forms require antifungal treatment, combined with surgery in some forms, particularly mucormycosis.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2015.Brands and brand management have become a central feature of the modern economy and a staple of business theory and business practice. In the business world it is common wisdom that brands have important effects on competition and the marketplace. Yet the two areas of law most concerned with competition - trademark and antitrust - have not yet fully come to grips with the importance of branding. In simplest terms, the law conflates trademarks and brands. Those scholars who contend that this is a mistake argue that brands are seen as indicating source and quality but that the other functions of brands are missed. Marketing and consumer literature brims with studies about the way brands use identity, emotion, and behavioral levers to compete beyond price. A brand-loyal customer may pay a premium for a brand for reasons other than quality and price. If one's brand cannot be copied, one's product may be so differentiated that competitors cannot compete and commodities such as wheat can be sold at higher margins than would otherwise be possible. Until recently, these effects were lost in trademark and competition law (antitrust) discussions. Part of the problem flows from reliance in both Europe and the USA on price theory for both intellectual property and antitrust law. Embracing other social science perspectives should bridge the gap. Current brand literature tends to describe competitive advantages a brand can offer, but the welfare and consumer effects are less clear. At first, understanding brands may challenge current models of competition law, as it may not offer the seemingly crisp outcomes regarding whether preferences and related market results are endogenous or exogenous. Nonetheless, given the importance of branding, the explicit desire to use brands to compete, and the way in which brands evade price theory, there is a vigorous debate regarding the extent to which competition law and trademark law must delve into these literatures. Thus the goal of this volume and our broader project on the nature of brands is to bring together scholars and practitioners from all of the relevant disciplines to learn from each other and explore what would constitute an appropriate legal framework for the treatment of brands in the modern economy.",

            "Abstract": "Background - Cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnostically challenging. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can assess abnormal myocardial interstitium. Methods and Results - Late gadolinium enhancement CMR was performed in 30 patients with cardiac amyloidosis. In 22 of these, myocardial gadolinium kinetics with T1 mapping was compared with that in 16 hypertensive controls. One patient had CMR and autopsy only. Subendocardial T1 in amyloid patients was shorter than in controls (at 4 minutes: 427\u00b173 versus 579\u00b175 ms; P<0.01), was shorter than subepicardium T1 for the first 8 minutes (P\u22640.01), and was correlated with markers of increased myocardial amyloid load, as follows: left ventricular (LV) mass (r= -0.51, P=0.013); wall thickness (r=-0.54 to -0.63, P<0.04); interatrial septal thickness (r=-0.52, P=0.001); and diastolic function (r=-0.42, P=0.025). Global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement was found in 20 amyloid patients (69%); these patients had greater LV mass (126\u00b130 versus 93\u00b125 g/m2; P=0.009) than unenhanced patients. Histological quantification showed substantial interstitial expansion with amyloid (30.5%) but only minor fibrosis (1.3%). Amyloid was dominantly subendocardial (42%) compared with midwall (29%) and subepicardium (18%). There was 97% concordance in diagnosis of cardiac amyloid. by combining the presence of late gadolinium enhancement and an optimized T1 threshold (191 ms at 4 minutes) between myocardium and blood. Conclusions - In cardiac amyloidosis, CMR shows a characteristic pattern of global subendocardial late enhancement coupled with abnormal myocardial and blood-pool gadolinium kinetics. The findings agree with the transmural histological distribution of amyloid protein and the cardiac amyloid load and may prove to have value in diagnosis and treatment follow-up.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 ESO, 2015.This paper presents an overview of the polarized sky as seen by Planck HFI at 353 GHz, which is the most sensitive Planck channel for dust polarization. We construct and analyse maps of dust polarization fraction and polarization angle at 1\u00b0 resolution, taking into account noise bias and possible systematic effects. The sensitivity of the Planck HFI polarization measurements allows for the first time a mapping of Galactic dust polarized emission on large scales, including low column density regions. We find that the maximum observed dust polarization fraction is high (p<inf>max</inf> = 19.8%), in particular in some regions of moderate hydrogen column density (N<inf>H</inf> < 2 \u00d7 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>). The polarization fraction displays a large scatter at N<inf>H</inf> below a few 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. There is a general decrease in the dust polarization fraction with increasing column density above N<inf>H</inf> \u223c 1 \u00d7 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> and in particular a sharp drop above N<inf>H</inf> \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. We characterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angle dispersion function. We find that the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas of several square degrees, separated by filamentary structures of high angle dispersion function. These appear as interfaces where the sky projection of the magnetic field changes abruptly without variations in the column density. The polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with the dispersion of polarization angles. These results suggest that, at the resolution of 1\u00b0, depolarization is due mainly to fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight, rather than to the loss of grain alignment in shielded regions. We also compare the polarization of thermal dust emission with that of synchrotron measured with Planck, low-frequency radio data, and Faraday rotation measurements toward extragalactic sources. These components bear resemblance along the Galactic plane and in some regions such as the Fan and North Polar Spur regions. The poor match observed in other regions shows, however, that dust, cosmic-ray electrons, and thermal electrons generally sample different parts of the line of sight.",

An extended structure is found in an incomplete arc of \u223c22'\u00e2\u20ac\u20ac diameter, which is cospatial with the termination shock due to interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM) as defined by Sahai & Chronopoulos from ultraviolet GALEX images. Fluxes are derived in the 70, 160, 250, 350, and 550 \u03bcm bands in the region where the interaction with the ISM takes place, and this can be fitted with a modified black body with a temperature of 25 \u00b1 3 K. Using the published proper motion and radial velocity for the star, we derive a heliocentric space motion of 25.1 km s-1. Using the PACS and SPIRE data and the analytical formula of the bow shock structure, we infer a de-projected standoff distance of the bow shock of R0 = (8.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1017 cm. We also derive a relative velocity of the star with respect to the ISM of (106.6 \u00b1 8.7)/$$ km s -1, where nISM is the number density of the local ISM. \u00a9 ESO, 2010.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.We used the Eulerian-Eulerian modeling approach to investigate lateral solid dispersion in fluidized beds. To estimate the lateral dispersion coefficient (Dsr) we fitted the void-free solid volume fraction radial profiles obtained from the numerical simulations of multifluid models with those obtained analytically by solving Fick's law. The profiles match very well. The values of Dsr obtained numerically are larger than the experimental ones, but the two do have the same order of magnitude. We believe that the overestimation is due to how we modeled the frictional solid stress; we used the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) model for the frictional solid pressure and the model of Schaeffer[20] for the frictional solid viscosity. To investigate how sensitive the numerical results are on the constitutive model used for the frictional stress, we ran the simulations again using a different frictional stress model, and changing the solid volume fraction at which the bed is assumed to enter the frictional flow regime (\u03c6min). We observed from the results that Dsr is quite sensitive to \u03c6min. This is because the latter influences the size and behavior of the bubbles in the bed. We obtained the best predictions for Dsr when \u03c6min is 0.50. The results show that accurate prediction of lateral solid dispersion in fluidized beds depends on adequate understanding of the frictional flow regime, and accurate modeling of the parameters that characterize the latter, in particular the frictional pressure.",

All rights reserved.Introduction: Smoking cessation is one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. Physicians are in a strong position to encourage smokers to make a quit attempt and to help them achieve long-term abstinence. Formal teaching on tobacco-related disease, the evidence base of smoking cessation, and practical skills training regarding cessation advice and counseling are therefore important parts of undergraduate medical education. A survey of U.K. medical schools conducted 11 years ago revealed substantial deficits in the curricular coverage of these topics. This study aimed at establishing whether the situation has improved since then. Methods: In 2013, all U.K. medical schools were invited to participate in an online survey of their curricular coverage of tobacco addiction and smoking cessation. Results: Of the 33 medical schools, 22 (67%) schools responded. Health effects of smoking were addressed in more than 90% of curricula, and factual knowledge on nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms was covered in 50% of curricula. Only 1 in 3 medical schools offered practical skills training in artificial (i.e., role play) or clinical settings, and 50% of schools did not address smoking in summative assessments. Conclusions: Practical skills training regarding cessation counseling is insufficient at most U.K. medical schools and may have become worse during the last 11 years. Increased curricular coverage-including summative assessments-of these topics would ensure that future physicians are adequately equipped to encourage and support effective evidence-based quit attempts in their patients.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014.Anaemia is common in patients with cardiac disease and also in those undergoing cardiac surgery. There is increasing evidence that preoperative anaemia is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality following surgery. We performed a systematic literature review to assess the impact of anaemia and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation on outcomes in cardiac surgery. Sixteen studies examined preoperative anaemia in detail. One study examined the role of preoperative IV iron administration and a further three, the effect of postoperative iron supplementation on haemoglobin (Hb) levels and the need for transfusion. Preoperative anaemia was associated with higher mortality, more postoperative blood transfusions, longer intensive care unit (ICU) and total hospital stay and also a greater incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events. In the single study that examined preoperative IV iron in combination with erythropoietin treatment, there was decreased blood transfusion, shorter hospital stay and an increase in patient survival. However, this was a small retrospective cohort study, with the observation and treatment groups analysed over different time periods. Postoperative administration of IV iron therapy, either alone or in combination with erythropoietin, was not effective in raising Hb levels or reducing red cell concentrate transfusion. On the basis of currently available evidence, the effect of perioperative administration of IV iron to cardiac surgery patients, alone or in combination with erythropoietin, remains unproven. Well-designed and appropriately powered prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate perioperative iron supplementation in the context of cardiac surgery.",

The standard paradigm for the design and analysis of computer experiments is to employ Gaussian random fields to model computer simulators. Gaussian process models are trained on input-output data obtained from simulation runs at various input values. Following this approach, we propose a sequential design algorithm MICE (mutual information for computer experiments) that adaptively selects the input values at which to run the computer simulator in order to maximize the expected information gain (mutual information) over the input space. The superior computational efficiency of the MICE algorithm compared to other algorithms is demonstrated by test functions and by a tsunami simulator with overall gains of up to 20% in that case.",

These equilibria involve a run on the central bank[U+05F3]s interest target, whereby money grows fast, private agents borrow as much as possible against the central bank, and the shadow interest rate is different from the policy target. We argue that these equilibria represent a particular danger when banks hold large excess reserves, such as is the case following periods of quantitative easing. Our analysis suggests that successfully managing the exit strategy requires additional tools beyond setting interest-rate targets and paying interest on reserves; in particular, freezing excess reserves or fiscal-policy intervention may be needed to fend off adverse expectations.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.Collagen 6-related dystrophies and myopathies (COL6-RD) are a group of disorders that form a wide phenotypic spectrum, ranging from severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, intermediate phenotypes, to the milder Bethlem myopathy. Both inter- and intrafamilial variable expressivity are commonly observed. We present clinical, immunohistochemical, and genetic data on four COL6-RD families with marked intergenerational phenotypic heterogeneity. This variable expression seemingly masquerades as anticipation is due to parental mosaicism for a dominant mutation, with subsequent full inheritance and penetrance of the mutation in the heterozygous offspring. We also present an additional fifth simplex patient identified as a mosaic carrier. Parental mosaicism was confirmed in the four families through quantitative analysis of the ratio of mutant versus wild-type allele (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) in genomic DNA from various tissues, including blood, dermal fibroblasts, and saliva. Consistent with somatic mosaicism, parental samples had lower ratios of mutant versus wild-type allele compared with the fully heterozygote offspring. However, there was notable variability of the mutant allele levels between tissues tested, ranging from 16% (saliva) to 43% (fibroblasts) in one mosaic father. This is the first report demonstrating mosaicism as a cause of intrafamilial/intergenerational variability of COL6-RD, and suggests that sporadic and parental mosaicism may be more common than previously suspected.",

Dyadic accuracy and that of the more competent member of each dyad matched closely, supporting the hypothesis that meritocratic leadership arises spontaneously between dyadically interacting fish, rather than the 'many wrongs' principle that has been used to explain group superiority in many species.",

All rights reserved.Objective: PI susceptibility results from a complex interplay between protease and Gag proteins, with Gag showing wide variation across HIV-1 subtypes. We explored the impact of pre-treatment susceptibility on the outcome of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Methods: Treatment-naive individuals who experienced lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy failure from the MONARK study were matched (by subtype, viral load and baseline CD4 count) with those who achieved virological response ('successes'). Successes were defined by viral load <400 copies/mL after week 24 and <50 copies/mL from week 48 to week 96. Full-length Gag-protease was amplified from patient samples for in vitro phenotypic susceptibility testing, with susceptibility expressed as fold change (FC) relative to a subtype B reference strain. Results: Baseline lopinavir susceptibility was lower in viral failures compared with viral successes, but the differences were not statistically significant (median lopinavir susceptibility: 4.4 versus 8.5, respectively, P=0.17). Among CRF02_AG/G patients, there was a significant difference in lopinavir susceptibility between the two groups (7.1 versus 10.4, P=0.047), while in subtype B the difference was not significant (2.7 versus 3.4, P=0.13). Subtype CRF02_AG/G viruses had a median lopinavir FC of 8.7 compared with 3.1 for subtype B (P=0.001). Conclusions: We report an association between reduced PI susceptibility (using full-length Gag-protease sequences) at baseline and subsequent virological failure on lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy in antiretroviral-naive patients harbouring subtype CRF02_AG/G viruses. We speculate that this may be important in the context of suboptimal adherence in determining viral failure.",

Riemannian HMC (RHMC) further improves the performance of HMC by exploiting the geometric properties of the parameter space. However, the geometric integrator used for RHMC involves implicit equations that require fixed-point iterations. In some cases, the computational overhead for solving implicit equations undermines RHMC\u2019s benefits. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, we propose an explicit integrator that replaces the momentum variable in RHMC by velocity. We show that the resulting transformation is equivalent to transforming Riemannian Hamiltonian dynamics to Lagrangian dynamics. Experimental results suggest that our method improves RHMC\u2019s overall computational efficiency in the cases considered.

We concentrate on the lower energy range of future instruments (E 50 EeV), where, if the UHECR source number density is not too low, the sources should be numerous enough to imprint a clustering pattern in the sky, and thus possibly in the UHECR arrival directions. Under these limits, the anisotropy signal should be dominated by the clustering of astrophysical sources per se in the large-scale structures, and not the clustering of events around individual sources. We study the potential for a statistical discrimination between different astrophysical models which we parametrise by the number density of UHECR sources, the possible bias of the UHECR accelerators with respect to the galaxy distribution, and the unknown fraction of UHECRs that have been deflected by large angles. We demonstrate that an order-of-magnitude increase in statistics would allow to discriminate between a variety of astrophysical models, provided that a sub-sample of light elements can be extracted, and that it represents a fraction 70% of the overall flux, sensitive to the UHECR source number density. Discrimination should be possible even without knowledge of the composition of the UHECRs, as long as the data are proton-dominated. We find that an anisotropy at the 99.7% level should be detectable when the number of detected events exceeds 2000 beyond 50 EeV, as long as the composition is proton dominated, and the number density of UHECR sources is relatively high, 10-3 Mpc-3. If the UHECR sources are strongly biased relative to the galaxy distribution, as are for example galaxy clusters, in which the sources might be embedded, an anisotropy at the 99.7% level should be detectable once the number of detected events exceeds 1000, if the fraction of protons at the highest energies is 60%.",

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Congenital aniridia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by varying degrees of iris hypoplasia that are associated with additional ocular abnormalities. More than 90% of the causal mutations identified are found in the PAX6 gene, a transcription factor of critical importance in the process of neurogenesis and ocular development. Here, we investigate clinical, molecular, and craniofacial features of a large Brazilian family with congenital aniridia. Among the 56 eyes evaluated, phenotype variation encompassed bilateral total aniridia to mild iris defects with extensive variation between eyes of the same individual. PAX6 molecular screening indicated a heterozygous splice mutation (c.141+1G>A). Thus, we hypothesize that this splicing event may cause variation in the expression of the wild-type transcript, which may lead to the observed variation in phenotype. Affected individuals were more brachycephalic, even though their face height and cephalic circumference were not significantly different when compared to those of non-affected relatives. From this, we infer that the head shape of affected subjects may also be a result of the PAX6 splice-site mutation. Our data summarize the clinical variability associated with the ocular phenotype in a large family with aniridia, and help shed light on the role of PAX6 in neurocranial development.",

Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the nature of imagery associated with mental contamination. Method: Fifteen people with contaminated-based OCD completed a semi-structured imagery interview designed specifically for this study. Results: Ten participants reported images associated with contamination. These images were vivid and distressing and evoked feelings of dirtiness. Participants engaged in a number of behaviours to neutralize their images, including compulsive washing. A small number of participants also reported images that protected them from contamination. Conclusions: In support of the theory of mental contamination (Rachman, 2006), images can lead to feelings of pollution and compulsive washing. Further research is needed to explore the role of imagery in maintaining contamination fears.",

These topics and their relationships have attracted the interest of scholars who have scrutinized the implications of accessibility and rurality for policy making and planning.The aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical modeling of accessibility and rurality and to develop an empirical study of their spatial patterns, with reference to the municipalities of the region of Sardinia, Italy. We study accessibility through an indicator constructed using a doubly constrained spatial interaction model and propose the Composite Index of Rurality that aims to evaluate rurality in a regional setting employing multivariate analysis. We investigate the spatial dependence of these indicators through general and local spatial autocorrelation analysis to verify the hypothesis that scarcely accessible spatial units are classifiable as rural areas. The results show that, for the case study of Sardinia, this hypothesis is not always true, as some urban areas are not always highly accessible.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Purpose: To explore the use and reproducibility of magnetic resonance-derived myocardial T1 mapping in patients with iron overload. Materials and Methods: The research received ethics committee approval and all patients provided written informed consent. This was a prospective study of 88 patients and 67 healthy volunteers. Thirty-five patients underwent repeat scanning for reproducibility. T1 mapping used the shortened modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence (ShMOLLI) with a second, confirmatory MOLLI sequence in the reproducibility group. T2\u2217 was performed using a commercially available sequence. The analysis of the T2\u2217 interstudy reproducibility data was performed by two different research groups using two different methods. Results: Myocardial T1 was lower in patients than healthy volunteers (836 \u00b1 138 msec vs. 968 \u00b1 32 msec, P < 0.0001). Myocardial T1 correlated with T2\u2217 (R = 0.79, P < 0.0001). No patient with low T2\u2217 had normal T1, but 32% (n = 28) of cases characterized by a normal T2\u2217 had low myocardial T1. Interstudy reproducibility of either T1 sequence was significantly better than T2\u2217, with the results suggesting that the use of T1 in clinical trials could decrease potential sample sizes by 7-fold. Conclusion: Myocardial T1 mapping is an alternative method for cardiac iron quantification. T1 mapping shows the potential for improved detection of mild iron loading. The superior reproducibility of T1 has potential implications for clinical trial design and therapeutic monitoring.",

All rights reserved.Background: Most pediatric lipodystrophy data come from high-income/middle-income countries, but most HIV-infected children live in sub-Saharan Africa, where lipodystrophy studies have predominantly investigated stavudine-based regimens. Methods: Three years after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses were measured (n = 590), and fasted lipid profile assayed (n = 325), in children from 2 ARROW trial centres in Uganda/Zimbabwe. Analyses compared randomization to long-term versus short-term versus no zidovudine from ART initiation [unadjusted; latter 2 groups receiving abacavir+lamivudine+non-nucleoside-reverse-transciptase-inhibitor (nNRTI) long-term], and nonrandomized (confounder-adjusted) receipt of nevirapine versus efavirenz. Results: Body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses were similar regardless of zidovudine exposure (P > 0.1), except for subscapular and supra-iliac skinfolds-for-age which were greater with long-term zidovudine (0.006 <P < 0.047). Circumferences/skinfolds were also similar with efavirenz and nevirapine (adjusted P > 0.09; 0.02 < P < 0.03 for waist/waist-hip-ratio). Total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, HDL/triglycerideratio (P < 0.0001) and triglycerides (P = 0.01) were lower with long-term zidovudine. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was higher with efavirenz than nevirapine (P < 0.001). Most lipids remained within normal ranges (75% cholesterol, 85% LDL and 100% triglycerides) but more on long-term zidovudine (3 NRTI) had abnormal HDL-cholesterol (88% vs. 40% short/no-zidovudine, P < 0.0001). Only 8/579(1.4%) children had clinical fat wasting (5 grade 1; 3 grade 2); 2(0.3%) had grade 1 fat accumulation. Conclusions: Long-term zidovudine-based ART is associated with similar body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses to abacavir-based ART, with low rates of lipid abnormalities and clinical lipodystrophy, providing reassurance where national programs now recommend long-term zidovudine. Efavirenz and nevirapine were also similar; however, the higher LDL observed with efavirenz and lower HDL observed with zidovudine suggests that zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz should be investigated in future.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2014.Background: Infective endocarditis (IE) causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Patient and pathogen profiles, as well as microbiological and operative strategies, continue to evolve. The impact of these changes requires evaluation to inform optimum management and identify individuals at high risk of early mortality. Aim: Identification of clinical and microbiological features, and surgical outcomes, among patients presenting to a UK tertiary cardiothoracic centre for surgical management of IE between 1998 and 2010. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Methods: Clinical, biochemical, microbiological and echocardiographic data were identified from clinical records. Principal outcomes were all-cause 28-day mortality and duration of post-operative admission. Results: Patients (n = 336) were predominantly male (75.0%); median age 52 years (IQR = 41-67). Most cases involved the aortic (56.0%) or mitral (53.9%) valves. Microbiological diagnoses, obtained in 288 (85.7%) patients, included streptococci (45.2%); staphylococci (34.5%); Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella (HACEK) organisms (3.0%); and fungi (1.8%); 11.3% had polymicrobial infection. Valve replacement in 308 (91.7%) patients included mechanical prostheses (69.8%), xenografts (24.0%) and homografts (6.2%). Early mortality was 12.2%, but fell progressively during the study (P = 0.02), as did median duration of post-operative admission (33.5 to 10.5 days; P = 0.0003). Multivariable analysis showed previous cardiothoracic surgery (OR = 3.85, P = 0.03), neutrophil count (OR = 2.27, P = 0.05), albumin (OR = 0.94, P = 0.04) and urea (OR = 2.63, P<0.001) predicted early mortality. Conclusions: This study demonstrates reduced post-operative early mortality and duration of hospital admission for IE patients over the past 13 years. Biomarkers (previous cardiothoracic surgery, neutrophil count, albumin and urea), predictive of early post-operative mortality, require prospective evaluation to refine algorithms, further improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs associated with IE.",

A main effects plan plus its foldover was used to estimate weights for each of the four levels of all five attributes. The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that 'attachment' and 'stability' each account for around 22% of the space, and 'autonomy', 'achievement' and 'enjoyment' account for around 18% each. Across all attributes, greater value was placed on the difference between the lowest levels of capability than between the highest. This tariff will enable ICECAP-A to be used in economic evaluation both within the field of health and across public policy generally.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background and Aims: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by acute deterioration of cirrhosis, systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure. Inflammation is also key to the pathobiology of portal hypertension. This study aims to define the relationship between systemic and hepatic haemodynamics in patients with ACLF. Methods: Sixty patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled - stable cirrhosis (SC, n = 27), acute decompensation without ACLF (AD, n = 14) and ACLF (n = 19) - and managed with standard therapy. Systemic and hepatic haemodynamic studies were performed, and patients were followed up for 3 months. Plasma norepinephrine, cytokine profile, nitrate/nitrite and malondialdehyde levels were measured. Results: Three-month mortality was as follows: SC - none; AD - 14%; ACLF - 47.2% (P < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure was lowest in the ACLF group (P < 0.001). ACLF patients had significantly higher hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG), while the hepatic blood flow was markedly reduced with an increase in intrahepatic resistance, which predicted mortality (AUROC: 0.87, P < 0.0001). In ACLF, the severity of intrahepatic resistance correlated with markers of inflammatory response, norepinephrine levels, creatinine levels and severity of encephalopathy. Modelling data showed that the high norepinephrine levels in ACLF may contribute to the right shift of the HVPG-hepatic blood flow relationship and its levels correlated with inflammatory markers and mortality (AUROC: 0.90; P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The disturbances in systemic and hepatic haemodynamics in alcohol-related ACLF are associated with dysregulated inflammation, multi-organ failure and marked activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These abnormalities predict high mortality rates in alcohol-related ACLF patients.",

While there is substantial individual variability in such evaluation, its neural basis is unknown. Here we asked whether individual differences in preconscious evaluation of social face traits were associated with local variability in brain structure. Adult human participants (n=36) monocularly viewed faces varying in dominance and trustworthiness, which were suppressed from awareness by a dynamic noise pattern shown to the other eye. The time taken for faces to emerge from suppression and become visible (t2e) was used as a measure of potency in competing for visual awareness. Both dominant and untrustworthy faces resulted in slower t2e than neutral faces, with substantial individual variability in these effects. Individual differences in t2e were correlated with gray matter volume in right insula for dominant faces, and with gray matter volume in medial prefrontal cortex, right temporoparietal junction and bilateral fusiform face area for untrustworthy faces. Thus, individual differences in preconscious social processing can be predicted from local brain structure, and separable correlates for facial dominance and untrustworthiness suggest distinct mechanisms of preconscious processing.",

The eye is an ideal organ to develop cell therapies as it is immune privileged, and modern surgical techniques enable precise delivery of cells to the retina. Furthermore, a range of noninvasive diagnostic tests and high-resolution imaging techniques facilitate the evaluation of any therapeutic intervention.

In 2012, door-to-door surveys with household residents (N = 304) were completed in areas of high, low, and ostensibly no flood risk. Using a probit model as a regression technique through the statistical software STATA, we explored factors that potentially influence coping and adaptation. Overall, coping and adaptation measures for flooding were not undertaken extensively and the rate of change to adopt measures was slow, even amongst flood-affected households. More work is needed to understand the reasons behind their reticence, especially to confirm how much financial factors are a limiting agent. The regression analysis indicated that more children and more men in the household supported the adoption of adaptation measures. As well, when people perceive that they live in a low or high flood risk zone, the likelihood of taking some adaptation measurements increases compared with the perception of living in a no flood risk zone. Meanwhile, the highest negative correlation was that living in a house elevated off the ground decreases the likelihood of taking other adaptation measurements by 20 %.",

Yet, little is currently known on the role of health insurance in facilitating access to care for children. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design made possible through a policy to provide health insurance to pre-school aged children in Vietnam, this paper evaluates the impact of health insurance on the health care utilization outcomes of children at the eligibility threshold of six years. Using three rounds of the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey, the study finds a positive impact on inpatient and outpatient visits and no significant impact on expenditures per visit at public facilities. We find moderately high use of private outpatient services and no evidence of a switch from private to covered public facilities under insurance. Results suggest that adopting public health insurance programs for children under age 6 may be an important vehicle to improving service utilization in a low- and middle-income country context. Challenges remain in providing adequate protections from the costs and other barriers to care.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2009 Taylor & Francis.Written by international experts in their respective fields, Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity provides a comprehensive overview of global issues of raw materials supply and resource use. It also introduces new views and perspectives on the sustainable growth of emerging economies and develops a rationale for a new resource economics. This book emphasises why resources are back on the agenda: firstly, because of their fundamental economic role in technological progress and long-term prosperity; secondly, because deficits in raw material markets are now intertwined with deficits in the financial markets; and, thirdly, because the sustainable management of natural resources is a crucial element in responses to new global challenges such as climate change. Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity analyses raw materials supply and resource use in a global context. The contributions present state-of-the-art results and perspectives on the availability of resources and discuss factors such as limited supply, demand from emerging and other economies and the critical shortage of some materials - particularly some metals - that are essential inputs in many high-tech processes and may put certain industries at risk. Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity sheds new light on the economics of sustainable growth. Linking the current financial crisis with stock market pricing and innovation dynamics, it argues for reforms in international macro-economic policies. It also critically discusses the implications of valuing labour productivity over capital and resource productivity and argues that policies favouring capital productivity will increase both social and economic sustainability. Further contributions are made on the business dimensions of material efficiency as well as on policy recommendations. The book examines the overall empirical trend towards decoupling resource use from economic growth. It undertakes a rigorous cross-country comparison and looks in more detail at the cases of Finland and Greece, as well as at emerging economies and their role in the global governance of natural resources. A key focus is placed on China, with discussion of recent findings regarding Chinese domestic policy on energy, climate and resources as well as on developing Chinese foreign policy in Africa. The book concludes with the positing of a new theory of resource economics: an emerging sub-discipline that puts resources at its heart but clearly aligns with other fields of economics, and transcends the borderlines of geology, geography, material science, recycling and waste, as well as elements of other social sciences. This important new book will be essential reading for economic researchers, governmental officials, businesses and NGOs with an interest in understanding the policy links to sustainable growth and in learning more about the emerging field of resource productivity.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of social support group interventions for people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Methods: A systematic review was performed. We searched electronic databases for randomised controlled trials. Two reviewers worked independently to select trials, extract data and assess risk of bias. Results: A total of 546 studies were identified of which two met the inclusion criteria. We were not able to pool data for further analyses, as the interventions tested in the studies meeting the inclusion criteria were too dissimilar in content. The first trial (n = 136) showed a benefit of early-stage memory loss social support groups for depression and quality of life in people with dementia. The second trial (n = 33) showed that post-treatment self-reported self-esteem was higher in the group receiving a multicomponent intervention of social support compared with that in the no intervention control group. Conclusions: Limited data from two studies suggest that support groups may be of psychological benefit to people with dementia by reducing depression and improving quality of life and self-esteem. These findings need to be viewed in light of the small number, small sample size and heterogeneous characteristics of current trials, indicating that it is difficult to draw any conclusions. More multicentre randomised controlled trials in social support group interventions for people with dementia are needed.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology \u00a9 2014 EAN.Background and purpose: Traditionally dystonia has been considered a disorder of basal ganglia dysfunction. However, recent research has advocated a more complex neuroanatomical network. In particular, there is increasing interest in the pathophysiological role of the cerebellum. Patients with cervical and focal hand dystonia have impaired cerebellar associative learning using the paradigm eyeblink conditioning. This is perhaps the most direct evidence to date that the cerebellum is implicated in patients. Methods: Eleven patients with DYT1 dystonia and five patients with DYT6 dystonia were examined and rates of eyeblink conditioning were compared with age-matched controls. A marker of brainstem excitability, the blink reflex recovery, was also studied in the same groups. Results: Patients with DYT1 and DYT6 dystonia have a normal ability to acquire conditioned responses. Blink reflex recovery was enhanced in DYT1 but this effect was not seen in DYT6. Conclusions: If the cerebellum is an important driver in DYT1 and DYT6 dystonia our data suggest that there is specific cerebellar dysfunction such that the circuits essential for conditioning function normally. Our data are contrary to observations in focal dystonia and suggest that the cerebellum may have a distinct role in different subsets of dystonia. Evidence of enhanced blink reflex recovery in all patients with dystonia was not found and recent studies calling for the blink recovery reflex to be used as a diagnostic test for dystonic tremor may require further corroboration.

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The development of an osteogenic bone graft substitute has important practical and cost implications in many branches of medicine where bone regeneration is required. Previous in vitro and small animal (murine) in vivo studies highlighted a porous hydroxyapatite/poly (DL-lactic acid) composite scaffold in combination with skeletal stem cells (SSCs) as a potential bone graft substitute candidate. The aim of the current study was to scale up the bone cell-scaffold construct to large animals and examine the potential for repair of a critical-sized defect via an ovine model. SSC seeded scaffolds (and unseeded scaffold controls) were implanted bilaterally into ovine femoral condyle critical defects for 3 months. A parallel in vitro analysis of ovine SSC seeded scaffolds was also performed. Post mortem mechanical indentation testing showed the bone strengths of the defect sites were 20% (controls) and 11% (SSC seeded scaffolds) those of normal cancellous bone (p < 0.01). MicroCT analysis demonstrated new bone formation within all defects with a mean increase of 13.4% in the control scaffolds over the SSC seeded scaffolds (p = 0.14). Histological examination confirmed these findings, with enhanced quality new bone within the control defects. This study highlights important issues and steps to overcome in scale-up and translation of tissue engineered products. The scaffold demonstrated encouraging results as an osteoconductive matrix; however, further work is required with cellular protocols before any human trials.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 American Psychological Association.The poor outcomes for cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage have been the driver behind research into techniques to detect disease before symptoms are manifest. For cervical and colorectal cancer, detection and treatment of \"precancers\" can prevent the development of cancer, a form of primary prevention. For other cancers-breast, prostate, lung, and ovarian-screening is a form of secondary prevention, aiming to improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis. International and national expert organizations regularly assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening technologies, issuing clinical guidelines for population-wide implementation. Psychological research has made important contributions to this process, assessing the psychological costs and benefits of possible screening outcomes (e.g., the impact of false positive results) and public tolerance of overdiagnosis. Cervical, colorectal, and breast screening are currently recommended, and prostate, lung, and ovarian screening are under active review. Once technologies and guidelines are in place, delivery of screening is implemented according to the health care system of the country, with invitation systems and provider recommendations playing a key role. Behavioral scientists can then investigate how individuals make screening decisions, assessing the impact of knowledge, perceived cancer risk, worry, and normative beliefs about screening, and this information can be used to develop strategies to promote screening uptake. This article describes current cancer screening options, discusses behavioral research designed to reduce underscreening and minimize inequalities, and considers the issues that are being raised by informed decision making and the development of risk-stratified approaches to screening.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.Background Focal therapy as a treatment option for localized prostate cancer (PCa) is an increasingly popular and rapidly evolving field. Objective To gather expert opinion on patient selection, interventions, and meaningful outcome measures for focal therapy in clinical practice and trial design. Design, setting, and participants Fifteen experts in focal therapy followed a modified two-stage RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Methodology process. All participants independently scored 246 statements prior to rescoring at a face-to-face meeting. The meeting occurred in June 2013 at the Royal Society of Medicine, London, supported by the Wellcome Trust and the UK Department of Health. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Agreement, disagreement, or uncertainty were calculated as the median panel score. Consensus was derived from the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry level. Results and limitations Of 246 statements, 154 (63%) reached consensus. Items of agreement included the following: patients with intermediate risk and patients with unifocal and multifocal PCa are eligible for focal treatment; magnetic resonance imaging-targeted or template-mapping biopsy should be used to plan treatment; planned treatment margins should be 5 mm from the known tumor; prostate volume or age should not be a primary determinant of eligibility; foci of indolent cancer can be left untreated when treating the dominant index lesion; histologic outcomes should be defined by targeted biopsy at 1 yr; residual disease in the treated area of \u22643 mm of Gleason 3 + 3 did not need further treatment; and focal retreatment rates of \u226420% should be considered clinically acceptable but subsequent whole-gland therapy deemed a failure of focal therapy. All statements are expert opinion and therefore constitute level 5 evidence and may not reflect wider clinical consensus. Conclusions The landscape of PCa treatment is rapidly evolving with new treatment technologies. This consensus meeting provides guidance to clinicians on current expert thinking in the field of focal therapy. Patient summary In this report we present expert opinion on patient selection, interventions, and meaningful outcomes for clinicians working in focal therapy for prostate cancer.",

In contrast, in this article, we study canonical service models where customers do not have such full information or capability. We assume that customers lack full capability or ample opportunities to perfectly infer the service rate or estimate the expected waiting time, and thus can only rely on past experiences and anecdotal reasoning to make their joining decisions. We fully characterize the steady-state equilibrium in this service system. Compared with the fully rational benchmark, we find that customers with anecdotal reasoning are less price-sensitive. Consequently, with a higher market potential (higher arrival rate), a revenue-maximizing firm may increase the price if the service rate is exogenous, and it may decrease the price if the service rate is at the firm's discretion. Both results go against the commonly accepted pricing recommendations in the fully rational benchmark. We also show that revenue maximization and welfare maximization lead to fundamentally different pricing strategies with anecdotal reasoning, whereas they are equivalent in the fully rational benchmark.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 British Journal of General Practice.Background The benefits of work for physical, psychological, and financial wellbeing are well documented. Return to work (RTW) after unintentional injury is often delayed, and psychological morbidity may contribute to this delay. The impact of psychological morbidity on RTW after a wide range of unintentional injuries in the UK has not been adequately quantified. Aim To quantify the role of psychological factors, including anxiety, depression, and post-Traumatic distress, on RTW following unintentional injuries. Design and setting A longitudinal multicentre prospective study was undertaken in Nottingham, Bristol, Leicester, and Guildford, UK. Method Participants (n = 273) were 16-69-year-olds admitted to hospital following unintentional injury, who were in paid employment prior to injury. They were surveyed at baseline, then at 1, 2, 4, and 12 months following injury; demographic data were collected along with injury characteristics, psychological morbidity, and RTW status. Associations between demographic, injury and psychological factors, and RTW between 2 and 12 months after injury were quantified using random effects logistic regression. Results The odds of RTW between 2 and 12 months after injury reduced as depression scores early in the recovery period (1 month after injury) increased (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79 to 0.95) and as length of hospital stay increased (OR 0.91, 95% CI] = 0.86 to 0.96). For those experiencing threatening life events following injury (OR 0.27, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.72) and with higher scores on the Crisis Support Scale (OR 0.93, 95% CI] = 0.88 to 0.99), the odds of RTW between 2 and 12 months after injury were lower. Multiple imputation analysis found similar results, but those relating to crisis support did not remain statistically significant. Conclusion Primary care professionals can identify patients at risk of delayed RTW who may benefit from management of psychological morbidity and support to RTW.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.Background: The aim was to examine the association of objective measures of physical functioning (PF) with education and material circumstances and the decline in PF with age by socioeconomic position (SEP). Methods: In 3,205 subjects (60-75 years) from the Czech Republic, we assessed relationship between PF, SEP, and age. Linear regression was used to assess PF measures and SEP measures. Results: Crosssectional decline in PF by age was similar in all individuals. Differences between SEP groups were similar across age groups, except for the difference in walk speed by material circumstances in men-bigger at older ages (p =.004). Men and women with the highest education were about 2 s faster at the chair rise test than those with the lowest education. Discussion: Findings suggest strong educational gradient in PF, an inconsistent role of self-assessed material circumstances, and virtually no interaction of SEP with the cross-sectional decline in PF by age.",

            "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016.The rapid population growth in urban India has outpaced the municipal capacity to build essential infrastructures that make life in cities safe and healthy. Local and national governments alike are grappling with the challenges of urbanization with thousands migrating from villages to cities. Thus, urbanization in India has been accompanied by a concentration of poverty and urban public healthcare has emerged as one of the most pressing priorities facing our country. Newborn mortality rates in urban settings are lower than rural areas, early neonatal deaths account for greater proportion than late neonatal deaths. The available evidence suggests that socio-economic inequalities and poor environment pose major challenges for newborn health. Moreover, fragmented and weak public health system, multiplicity of actors and limited capacity of public health planning further constrain the delivery of quality and affordable health care service. Though healthcare is concentrated in urban areas, delay in deciding to seek health care, reaching a source of it and receiving appropriate care affects the health outcomes disproportionately. However, a few city initiatives and innovations piloted in different states and cities have brought forth the evidences of effectiveness of different strategies. Recently launched National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) provides an opportunity for strategic thinking and actions to improve newborn health outcomes in India. There is also an opportunity for coalescence of activities around National Health Mission (NHM) and Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health+Adolescent (RMNCH+A) strategy to develop feasible and workable models in different urban settings. Concomitant operational research needs to be carried out so that the obstacles, approaches and response to the program can be understood.",
