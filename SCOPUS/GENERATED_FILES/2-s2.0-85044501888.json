The need to effectively manage the provision of these announcements has led to a substantial growth in the body of literature which is devoted to that topic. In this survey paper, we systematically review the relevant literature, summarize some of its key ideas and findings, describe the main challenges that the different approaches to the problem entail, and formulate research directions that would be interesting to consider in future work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delay announcements", "Queueing models", "Service systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delay announcements", "In-service systems", "Literature survey", "Queueing model", "Service provider", "Service systems", "Waiting time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044501888", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"26031398500": {"Name": "Ibrahim R.", "AuthorID": "26031398500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}}}
