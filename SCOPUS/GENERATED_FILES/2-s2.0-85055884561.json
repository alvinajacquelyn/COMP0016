Computational models exist that simulate this ability, however they predict listener confusions poorly, particularly in the case where the two vowels have the same fundamental frequency. Presented here is a model that is uniquely able to predict the combined representation of concurrent vowels. The given model is able to predict listener\u2019s systematic perceptual decisions to a high degree of accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational model", "Critical case", "Fundamental frequencies", "High degree of accuracy", "Pitch differences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055884561", "SubjectAreas": [["Music", "ARTS", "1210"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57204513795": {"Name": "Smith S.S.", "AuthorID": "57204513795", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research, University of Nottingham"}, "16508104900": {"Name": "Sumner C.J.", "AuthorID": "16508104900", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research, University of Nottingham"}, "14068506500": {"Name": "Chintanpalli A.", "AuthorID": "14068506500", "AffiliationID": "60000414", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science"}, "7004584074": {"Name": "Heinz M.G.", "AuthorID": "7004584074", "AffiliationID": "60122579, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, Purdue University"}}}
