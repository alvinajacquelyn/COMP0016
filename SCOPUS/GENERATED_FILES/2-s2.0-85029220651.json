All over the world, dedicated programs have been founded and implemented at single institutions or as national programs, variously involving healthcare providers, national societies, governments and charitable institutions. A major issue to address regards the model of care to be used, as the traditional pediatric and adult health care systems have shown to be inadequate to deal with these patients\u2019 peculiarities. This chapter discusses the possible models of care and whether a single new model should exist for AYA as well as it could feasibly be implemented; the key themes for an ideal AYA model; the various models of AYA cancer care which have been implemented internationally, with similarities or differences reflecting variations in local medical culture and resources. In addition, this chapter aims to address the way in which various barriers and enablers interact with each component of the definition of access to care, i.e. timeliness, utilization, and structure of health services, to influence outcomes for this patient group.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029220651", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7401587230": {"Name": "Ferrari A.", "AuthorID": "7401587230", "AffiliationID": "60006583", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Oncology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori"}, "57191926318": {"Name": "Albritton K.", "AuthorID": "57191926318", "AffiliationID": "107632730", "AffiliationName": "Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology, Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center"}, "56506539400": {"Name": "Osborn M.", "AuthorID": "56506539400", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57203102859": {"Name": "Barr R.", "AuthorID": "57203102859", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics, Pathology and Medicine, McMaster University"}, "55364132700": {"Name": "Johnson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55364132700", "AffiliationID": "60033034", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Adolescent and Young, Mary Bridge Hospital/MultiCare Health System"}, "7102909647": {"Name": "Stark D.", "AuthorID": "7102909647", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "The Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, Leeds Institute of Oncology, St James\u2019s University Hospital"}, "7202609757": {"Name": "Whelan J.", "AuthorID": "7202609757", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "The London Sarcoma Service, University College Hospital"}}}
