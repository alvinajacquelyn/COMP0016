We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anonymity", "Computer-mediated communication", "Intergroup contact", "Prejudice", "Social presence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anonymity", "Computer mediated communication", "Intergroup contacts", "Prejudice", "Social presence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028744719", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"35746852100": {"Name": "Schumann S.", "AuthorID": "35746852100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "7006311271": {"Name": "Klein O.", "AuthorID": "7006311271", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "7004399921": {"Name": "Hewstone M.", "AuthorID": "7004399921", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "7101692693": {"Name": "Douglas K.", "AuthorID": "7101692693", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}}}
