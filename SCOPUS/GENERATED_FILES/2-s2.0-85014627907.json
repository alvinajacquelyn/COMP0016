Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and the accumulation of APP-derived amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides are key processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We designed a phenotypic small-molecule screen to identify modulators of APP processing in trisomy 21/Down syndrome neurons, a complex genetic model of AD. We identified the avermectins, commonly used as anthelmintics, as compounds that increase the relative production of short A\u03b2 peptides at the expense of longer, potentially more toxic peptides. Further studies demonstrated that this effect is not due to an interaction with the core \u03b3-secretase responsible for A\u03b2 production. This study demonstrates the feasibility of phenotypic drug screening in human stem cell models of Alzheimer-type dementia, and points to possibilities for indirectly modulating APP processing, independently of \u03b3-secretase modulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid beta", "dementia", "Down syndrome", "human neurons", "iPSCs", "ivermectin", "neural stem cells", "phenotypic screening", "selamectin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Anthelmintics", "Cells, Cultured", "Down Syndrome", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Ivermectin", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014627907", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57193536317": {"Name": "Brownjohn P.W.", "AuthorID": "57193536317", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "The Gurdon Institute and Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57194223879": {"Name": "Smith J.", "AuthorID": "57194223879", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "The Gurdon Institute and Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004675619": {"Name": "Livesey F.J.", "AuthorID": "7004675619", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "The Gurdon Institute and Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56520148100": {"Name": "Kvartsberg H.", "AuthorID": "56520148100", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603064153": {"Name": "Serneels L.", "AuthorID": "6603064153", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetics (CME), Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease (LIND), University of Leuven (KU Leuven)"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
