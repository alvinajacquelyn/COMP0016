To deliver a sustainable city for all requires a more frank and comprehensive focus on procedure: On who makes decisions, under which frameworks, based upon what kind of data or knowledge, and with what degree and direction of accountability? Acting on these procedural questions is the promise of transformative urban development. This paper explores the status of risk sensitive and transformative urban development and the scope for transition towards these components of sustainability in urban sub-Saharan Africa through the lens of diverse city cases: Karonga (Malawi), Ibadan (Nigeria), Niamey (Niger) and Nairobi (Kenya). The paper draws from a 3-year research and capacity building programme called Urban Africa: Risk Knowledge that aims to address gaps in data, understandings and capacity to break cycles of risk accumulation. A common analytical framework is presented to help identify blockages and opportunities for transition towards a risk-sensitive and transformative urban development. This framework is then illustrated through each city in turn and a concluding discussion reflects on city observations to draw out recommendations for city level and wider action and research partnerships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Risk-sensitive development", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Transformative urban development", "Transition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051058955", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55053404800": {"Name": "Leck H.", "AuthorID": "55053404800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, School of Global Affairs, King's College London"}, "7003350514": {"Name": "Pelling M.", "AuthorID": "7003350514", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, School of Global Affairs, King's College London"}, "6506385136": {"Name": "Adelekan I.", "AuthorID": "6506385136", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Ibadan"}, "15050934700": {"Name": "Nwokocha E.", "AuthorID": "15050934700", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Ibadan"}, "24831833300": {"Name": "Dodman D.", "AuthorID": "24831833300", "AffiliationID": "60092016", "AffiliationName": "Human Settlements Research Group, International Institute for Environment and Development"}, "57197744340": {"Name": "Issaka H.", "AuthorID": "57197744340", "AffiliationID": "60072712", "AffiliationName": "Agro\u00e9conomiste D\u00e9partement de Sociologie et Economie Rurales, Facult\u00e9 d'Agronomie, Universit\u00e9 Abdou Moumouni"}, "57194170209": {"Name": "Boubacar S.", "AuthorID": "57194170209", "AffiliationID": "60072712", "AffiliationName": "Agro\u00e9conomiste D\u00e9partement de Sociologie et Economie Rurales, Facult\u00e9 d'Agronomie, Universit\u00e9 Abdou Moumouni"}, "13405704500": {"Name": "Johnson C.", "AuthorID": "13405704500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}, "57193237979": {"Name": "Osuteye E.", "AuthorID": "57193237979", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}, "56418744100": {"Name": "Manda M.", "AuthorID": "56418744100", "AffiliationID": "60116777", "AffiliationName": "Urban and Regional Department, Mzuzu University"}, "14031638400": {"Name": "Mberu B.", "AuthorID": "14031638400", "AffiliationID": "106632915", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Centre, APHRC Campus, Manga Cl"}}}
