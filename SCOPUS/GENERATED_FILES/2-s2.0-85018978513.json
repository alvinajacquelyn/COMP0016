We prospectively evaluated carotid plaque 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in patients with recent carotid events, assessed inter- and intraobserver variability of such measurements, and explored the mechanism of any plaque DOTATATE activity with immunohistochemistry in resected specimens. Methods: Twenty consecutively consenting patients with recent symptomatic carotid events (transient ischemic attack, stroke, or amaurosis fugax), due for carotid endarterectomy, were prospectively recruited. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT of the neck was performed before surgery. 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake was measured by drawing regions of interest along the carotid plaques and contralateral plaques/carotid arteries by an experienced radionuclide radiologist and radiographer. Two PET quantification methods with inter- and intraobserver variability were assessed. Resected carotid plaques were retrieved for somatostatin receptor subtype-2 (sst2) immunohistochemical staining. Results: The median time delay between research PET and surgery was 2 d. SUVs and target-to-background ratios for the symptomatic plaques and the asymptomatic contralateral carotid arteries/plaques showed no significant difference (n = 19, P > 0.10), regardless of quantification method. The intraclass correlation coefficient was greater than 0.8 in all measures of carotid artery/plaque uptake (SUV) and greater than 0.6 in almost all measures of target-to-background ratio. None of the excised plaques was shown to contain cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, vessel-associated cells) expressing sst2 on their cell membrane. Conclusion: 68Ga-DOTATATE activity on PET in recently symptomatic carotid plaques is not significantly different fromcontralateral carotids/plaques. Any activity seen on PET is not shown to be from specific sst2 receptor-mediated uptake in vitro. It is therefore unlikely that sst2 PET/CT imaging will have a role in the detection and characterization of symptomatic carotid plaques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carotid", "DOTATATE", "PET/CT", "Somatostatin", "Vulnerable plaques"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carotid Stenosis", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Molecular Imaging", "Observer Variation", "Organometallic Compounds", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Receptors, Somatostatin", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tissue Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018978513", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56609752400": {"Name": "Wan M.Y.S.", "AuthorID": "56609752400", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23027243700": {"Name": "Endozo R.", "AuthorID": "23027243700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "35311408700": {"Name": "Michopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "35311408700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "56004642300": {"Name": "Shortman R.", "AuthorID": "56004642300", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "24335636100": {"Name": "Menezes L.", "AuthorID": "24335636100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "22036034000": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Justo M.", "AuthorID": "22036034000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London"}, "7202749095": {"Name": "Yusuf S.", "AuthorID": "7202749095", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals"}, "56427569500": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "56427569500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, University College London"}, "8906575900": {"Name": "Wild D.", "AuthorID": "8906575900", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, University of Basel Hospital"}, "7003958079": {"Name": "Waser B.", "AuthorID": "7003958079", "AffiliationID": "60059332, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Experimental Cancer Research, Institute of Pathology, University of Berne"}, "35430766900": {"Name": "Reubi J.C.", "AuthorID": "35430766900", "AffiliationID": "60059332, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Experimental Cancer Research, Institute of Pathology, University of Berne"}}}
