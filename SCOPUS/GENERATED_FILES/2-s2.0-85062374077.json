We believe assessing mind wandering could be especially relevant to individuals, including many females, who present with less externalising manifestations of ADHD. Using a new measure based on ADHD patient reports, the Mind Excessively Wandering Scale (MEWS), we previously found adults with ADHD had elevated levels of mind wandering that contributed to impairment independently of core ADHD symptoms. Using data from an online general population survey, the current study assessed the factor-structure, reliability, validity and measurement invariance of the MEWS. We also investigated sex differences in mind wandering, as well as ADHD symptoms, impairment and wellbeing in those with and without ADHD. The MEWS had a unidimensional structure, was invariant across sex, age and ADHD status, and accounted for unique variance in impairment and wellbeing beyond core ADHD symptoms. Among those with ADHD, we found no evidence for sex differences in mind wandering and among those without ADHD males had higher scores. We also found similar levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity, emotional lability, and impairment in males and females with ADHD, but males reported greater inattention and lower wellbeing. Results suggest the MEWS is a reliable and valid instrument measuring the same construct across sex, age and ADHD status, which could aid diagnosis and monitoring of outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attention", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sex Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062374077", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55747911000": {"Name": "Mowlem F.D.", "AuthorID": "55747911000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Centre (SGDP), Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "21738936300": {"Name": "Agnew-Blais J.", "AuthorID": "21738936300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Centre (SGDP), Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35402700900": {"Name": "Asherson P.", "AuthorID": "35402700900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Centre (SGDP), Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
