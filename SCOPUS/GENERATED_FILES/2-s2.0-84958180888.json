AMD is characterized by accumulation of toxic amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2); the question we raise is as follows: is P2X7 receptor, known to play an important role in several degenerative diseases, involved in A\u03b2 toxicity on M\u00fcller cells? Retinal M\u00fcller glial cells were incubated with A\u03b2 for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the alamarBlue assay and cytotoxicity using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. P2X7 receptor expression was highlighted by immunolabeling observed on confocal microscopy and its activation was evaluated by YO-PRO-1 assay. Hoechst 33342 was used to evaluate chromatin condensation, and caspases 8 and 3 activation was assessed using AMC assays. Lipid formulation rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) used in Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 was incubated on cells for 15 min prior to A\u03b2 incubation. For the first time, we showed that A\u03b2 induced caspase-independent apoptosis through P2X7 receptor activation on our retinal model. DHA and EPA are polyunsaturated fatty acids recommended in food supplement to prevent AMD. We therefore modulated A\u03b2 cytotoxicity using a lipid formulation rich in DHA and EPA to have a better understanding of the results observed in clinical studies. We showed that fish oil rich in EPA and DHA, in combination with a potent P2X7 receptor antagonist, represents an efficient modulator of A\u03b2 toxicity and that P2X7 could be an interesting therapeutic target to prevent AMD.
