Normalization of an intervention is essential to have a population impact, which is defined as \u2018the process of getting a new intervention into routine practice\u2019. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the normalization potential of a complex mHealth intervention for adolescents with asthma (ADolescent Adherence Patient Tool; ADAPT) in community pharmacy practice. Methods: The Normalization Process Theory (NPT), a sociological action theory, was retrospectively applied to study the normalization potential of ADAPT. NPT explains factors that promote or hinder implementation, embedding, and integration of new interventions in clinical practice. Evaluation data (structured interviews and questionnaires) of 23 pharmacists who used the ADAPT intervention were used for this study. Results: Pharmacists understood the purpose of the ADAPT intervention and were prepared to undertake the necessary work of implementation. However changes at different levels are needed to support full normalization, such as changes in the intervention itself and changes in the pharmacist's work flow. The potential for normalization could also be enhanced by the use of product champions and appropriate reimbursement guidelines, to ensure uptake of the intervention by other pharmacists. Support from professional bodies for the use of mHealth could also promote normalization. Conclusions: Normalization of mHealth is a complex continuous process. The ADAPT intervention has the potential to be normalized in community pharmacy practice, but full normalization would require changes in both daily pharmacy practice and reimbursement models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Adolescents", "Asthma", "Community pharmacy", "mHealth", "Normalization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065781658", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57193721311": {"Name": "Kosse R.C.", "AuthorID": "57193721311", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Faculty of Science, Utrecht University"}, "7005167271": {"Name": "Bouvy M.L.", "AuthorID": "7005167271", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Faculty of Science, Utrecht University"}, "35094113700": {"Name": "Koster E.S.", "AuthorID": "35094113700", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Faculty of Science, Utrecht University"}, "7202670002": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "7202670002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "7102016915": {"Name": "de Vries T.W.", "AuthorID": "7102016915", "AffiliationID": "60070191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Medical Centre Leeuwarden (MCL)"}}}
