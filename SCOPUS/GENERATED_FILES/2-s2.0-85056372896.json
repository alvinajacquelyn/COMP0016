This answers a question of Messuti and Schacht. We deduce that the homomorphism threshold of {\ud835\udc363, \ud835\udc365}-free graphs is 1/5, thus answering a question of Oberkampf and Schacht.", "AuthorKeywords": ["homomorphic threshold", "large minimum degree", "odd girth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Free graphs", "homomorphic threshold", "Minimum degree", "odd girth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056372896", "SubjectAreas": [["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"55227074100": {"Name": "Letzter S.", "AuthorID": "55227074100", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge"}, "57201493985": {"Name": "Snyder R.", "AuthorID": "57201493985", "AffiliationID": "60028599", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis"}}}
