Data for four markets over a period from Q1 2007 to Q1 2011 is used. EnergyStar certification scores are used to determine the level of energy efficiency and a hedonic pricing method to model operating expenses. The results indicate a positive but non-linear relationship between costs and efficiency. Out of a number of considered explanations this seems to be best explained by initial technological difficulties in implementing energy efficiency, a self-selection bias influencing the data or a combination of different effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corporate sustainability", "Energy efficiency", "Green buildings", "Green real estate", "Low-energy office buildings", "Operating expenses", "Sustainable consumer behaviour", "Sustainable finance", "Sustainable strategies implementation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Corporate-sustainability", "Green buildings", "Operating expense", "Real estate", "Sustainable strategies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928791081", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56613389900": {"Name": "Szumilo N.", "AuthorID": "56613389900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge"}}}
