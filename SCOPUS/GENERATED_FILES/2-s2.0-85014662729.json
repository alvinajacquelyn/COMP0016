A number of studies also indicate that the molecule plays a beneficial role in skin homoeostasis. In this review, we describe the physicochemical properties of hexamidine diisethionate (HEX D) and the corresponding hydrochloride salt (HEX H). The biocidal and protease inhibition properties of HEX are outlined as well as the effects of HEX on lipid processing enzymes, corneocyte maturity, stratum corneum thickness and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Skin permeation properties of HEX D and HEX H are summarized, and formulation approaches for effective dermal targeting of HEX are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biocide", "formulation", "hexamidine", "protease inhibitor", "salt", "skin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Topical", "Benzamidines", "Cosmetics", "Humans", "Salts", "Skin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014662729", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56780056200": {"Name": "Parisi N.", "AuthorID": "56780056200", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7004473297": {"Name": "Lever R.", "AuthorID": "7004473297", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57213994372": {"Name": "Hadgraft J.", "AuthorID": "57213994372", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8560630100": {"Name": "Matts P.J.", "AuthorID": "8560630100", "AffiliationID": "60025856", "AffiliationName": "Procter & Gamble Technical Centres Ltd, London Innovation Centre"}}}
