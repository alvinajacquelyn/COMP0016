Their use in orthopaedics is increasing and has been trialed in fracture management, spinal fusion and tendon and ligament healing. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a significant economic burden and often require surgical reconstruction. This review article used laboratory and clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of PRP and growth factors as an adjunct to ACL reconstruction. Overall, the results of studies to date have been disappointing especially given the success in other specialties. PRP has been relatively successful in improving vascularization within the tibial tunnel but less so in the femoral tunnels. The targeting of specific growth factors seems to show more promise than generic PRP injections with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) showing the most significant results in graft healing. Further trials are still required before a definitive conclusion can be reached.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior cruciate ligament", "Growth factors", "Platelet rich plasma", "Repair", "Surgical reconstruction", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction", "Humans", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Platelet-Rich Plasma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989244694", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"56015658700": {"Name": "Tibrewal S.", "AuthorID": "56015658700", "AffiliationID": "60087965", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Orthopaedics Research Institute"}, "57191372781": {"Name": "Bissell L.", "AuthorID": "57191372781", "AffiliationID": "60000468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Manly Hospital"}, "57191371774": {"Name": "Sahni V.", "AuthorID": "57191371774", "AffiliationID": "60000468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Manly Hospital"}, "35229756200": {"Name": "Khan W.S.", "AuthorID": "35229756200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
