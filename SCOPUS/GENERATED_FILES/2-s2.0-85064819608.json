Recently, we demonstrated the utility of the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test to stratify prognosis in PSC. We observed that patients with PSC + CCA had significantly higher ELF score than those with PSC alone. In this study, we aimed to investigate further this association in a larger cohort of PSC patients with CCA compared with patients with PSC or CCA alone. Materials and methods: Stored sera from patients with PSC (n = 119), CCA without known chronic liver disease (n = 36) and PSC + CCA (n = 32) were tested for ELF. ELF score, gender, age, age at disease diagnosis, inflammatory bowel disease, PSC duration and severity, and CCA features were compared amongst the three cohorts. Factors related to an elevated ELF score were investigated. Results: Enhanced liver fibrosis score was significantly higher in patients with CCA without underlying chronic liver disease and in patients with PSC + CCA compared to those with PSC alone (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, elevated ELF score was associated with the diagnosis of CCA independently of age and PSC status (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Enhanced liver fibrosis score was elevated in patients with CCA irrespective of the presence of PSC, and independently of liver disease stage. Our results indicate that the association between high ELF score and CCA may be related to the tumour\u2019s desmoplastic nature, independent of background liver fibrosis, suggesting that ELF score could be used to risk stratify for CCA in PSC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cholangiocarcinoma", "enhanced liver fibrosis score", "noninvasive markers", "primary sclerosing cholangitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Bile Duct Neoplasms", "Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic", "Biomarkers", "Cholangiocarcinoma", "Cholangitis, Sclerosing", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Klatskin Tumor", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064819608", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57202711839": {"Name": "Saffioti F.", "AuthorID": "57202711839", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Clinical and Molecular Hepatology, University of Messina"}, "22958739600": {"Name": "Roccarina D.", "AuthorID": "22958739600", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London & Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London & Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London & Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205414322": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "57205414322", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London & Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55217322300": {"Name": "Thorburn D.", "AuthorID": "55217322300", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London & Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23490689300": {"Name": "Vesterhus M.", "AuthorID": "23490689300", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen"}, "25621160900": {"Name": "Hov J.R.", "AuthorID": "25621160900", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "7003633701": {"Name": "Boberg K.M.", "AuthorID": "7003633701", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}}}
