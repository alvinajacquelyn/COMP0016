In this paper we present the AR-Rift 2 system, a cost-effective prototype VSAR system based around the Oculus Rift CV1 head-mounted display (HMD). Current consumer camera systems however typically have latencies far higher than the rendering pipeline of current consumer HMDs. They also have lower update rate than the display. We thus measure the latency of the video and implement a simple image-warping method to ensure smooth movement of the video.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Augmented reality", "Image-based rendering", "Latency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost effective", "Head mounted displays", "Human computer interfaces", "Image based rendering", "Latency", "Rendering pipelines", "Smooth movement", "Virtual scenes"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018371669", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"18435050200": {"Name": "Steed A.", "AuthorID": "18435050200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57194038390": {"Name": "Adipradana Y.", "AuthorID": "57194038390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56095032700": {"Name": "Friston S.", "AuthorID": "56095032700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
