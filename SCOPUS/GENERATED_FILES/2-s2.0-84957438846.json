This study compares 6-month clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) compared with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the setting of a randomized clinical trial. Methods: Patients with symptomatic primary varicose veins were randomized to EVLA or RFA and followed up for 6 months to evaluate clinical improvements, health related quality of life (HRQOL) and cost-effectiveness. Results: A total of 131 patients were randomized, of which 110 attended 6-month follow-up (EVLA n = 54; RFA n = 56). Improvements in quality of life (AVVQ and SF-12v2) and Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS) achieved at 6 weeks were maintained at 6 months, with no significant difference detected between treatment groups. There were no differences in treatment failure rates. There were small differences in favor of EVLA in terms of costs and 6-month HRQOL but these were not statistically significant. However, RFA is associated with less pain at up to 10 days. Conclusions: EVLA and RFA result in comparable and significant gains in quality of life and clinical improvements at 6 months, compared with baseline values. EVLA is more likely to be cost-effective than RFA but absolute differences in costs and HRQOL are small.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cost-effectiveness", "Endovenous laser ablation", "Quality of life", "Radiofrecuency ablation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absolute difference", "Different treatments", "Endovenous laser", "Health-related quality of lives", "Quality of life", "Radiofrequency ablation", "Randomized clinical trials", "Treatment failure", "Adult", "Aged", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Humans", "Laser Therapy", "Low-Level Light Therapy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Economic", "Patient Satisfaction", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome", "Varicose Veins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957438846", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"26632659000": {"Name": "Shepherd A.C.", "AuthorID": "26632659000", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60175990", "AffiliationName": "Academic Section of Vascular Surgery, Imperial College School of Medicine, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "7004532180": {"Name": "Gohel M.S.", "AuthorID": "7004532180", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital Cambridge"}, "55469000400": {"Name": "Davies A.H.", "AuthorID": "55469000400", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60175990", "AffiliationName": "Academic Section of Vascular Surgery, Imperial College School of Medicine, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "6506879891": {"Name": "Ortega-Ortega M.", "AuthorID": "6506879891", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Economics, University of Granada"}, "56665554000": {"Name": "Epstein D.", "AuthorID": "56665554000", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Economics, University of Granada"}, "8547250200": {"Name": "Brown L.C.", "AuthorID": "8547250200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}}}
