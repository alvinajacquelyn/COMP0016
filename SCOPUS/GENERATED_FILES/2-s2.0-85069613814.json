In particular, recent research has found that the notion of time may be an essential but complex concept through which students make (un)conscious and self-regulated decisions as to when, what, and how to study. This study explores distinct clusters of behavioural engagement in an online e-tutorial called Sowiso at different time points (before tutorials, before quizzes, before exams), and their associations with academic performance, self-regulated learning strategies, epistemic learning emotions, and activity learning emotions. Using a cluster analysis on trace data of 1035 students practicing 429 online exercises in Sowiso, we identified four distinct cluster of students (e.g. early mastery, strategic, exam-driven, and inactive). Further analyses revealed significant differences between the four clusters in their academic performance, step-wise cognitive processing strategies, external self-regulation strategies, epistemic learning emotions and activity learning emotions. Our findings took a step forward towards personalised and actionable feedback in learning analytics by recognizing the complexity of how and when students engage in learning activities over time, and supporting educators to design early and theoretically informed interventions based on learning dispositions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blended learning", "Learning analytics", "Learning dispositions", "Mathematics", "Self-regulated learning", "Temporal analytics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blended learning", "Learning analytics", "Learning dispositions", "Self-regulated learning", "Temporal analytics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069613814", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"26656113500": {"Name": "Rienties B.", "AuthorID": "26656113500", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Educational Technology, Learning and Teaching Innovation, Open University"}, "57193622547": {"Name": "Nguyen Q.", "AuthorID": "57193622547", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Educational Technology, Learning and Teaching Innovation, Open University"}, "7005935975": {"Name": "Littlejohn A.", "AuthorID": "7005935975", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Glasgow"}, "14625538000": {"Name": "Tempelaar D.", "AuthorID": "14625538000", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Econometrics, School of Business and Economics, Maastricht University"}}}
