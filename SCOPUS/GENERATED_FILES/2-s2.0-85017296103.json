The difference between neuroanatomical age and chronological age was compared between the three groups. Methods Neuroanatomical age was estimated using a machine learning-based method that was trained using structural MRI scans from a large independent healthy control sample (N = 2001). The prediction model was then used to estimate age from MRI scans obtained from newly diagnosed focal epilepsy patients (N = 42), medically refractory focal epilepsy patients (N = 94) and healthy controls (N = 74). Results Individuals with medically refractory epilepsy had a difference between predicted brain age and chronological age that was on average 4.5 years older than healthy controls (p = 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22125). No significant differences were observed in newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Earlier age of onset was associated with an increased brain age difference in the medically refractory group (p = 0.034). Significance Medically refractory focal epilepsy is associated with structural brain changes that resemble premature brain aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Machine learning", "Neuroimaging", "Seizures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging, Premature", "Brain", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsies, Partial", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017296103", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6602729725": {"Name": "Pardoe H.R.", "AuthorID": "6602729725", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "36943568500": {"Name": "Blackmon K.", "AuthorID": "36943568500", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "6507596369": {"Name": "Thesen T.", "AuthorID": "6507596369", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "57197933739": {"Name": "Kuzniecky R.", "AuthorID": "57197933739", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "7403376270": {"Name": "Cole J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403376270", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Computational, Clinical and Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
