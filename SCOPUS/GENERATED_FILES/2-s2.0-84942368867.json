On the basis of work done in the Netherlands, this paper shows two things in particular. First, how decision making responses historically have been subject to change under the influence of floods and how the emergence of climate change has significantly changed these floods. Second, based on the analysis of processes dealing with a blue-green algae problem in a lake, climate change not only changed decision making responses but also changed the very reality that is being enacted. Consequently, this brings an ethical dimension to the fore, related to the intrinsic tension between the growing awareness that \u201call is interconnected\u201d on the one hand and the realization we cannot take all into account.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blue green algae", "Netherlands", "Take-all", "Uncertain climate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942368867", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56403325200": {"Name": "Zegwaard A.", "AuthorID": "56403325200", "AffiliationID": "60117141, 60008734", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM), VU University"}, "7102826598": {"Name": "Wester P.", "AuthorID": "7102826598", "AffiliationID": "60071806", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)"}, "55551003300": {"Name": "Petersen A.", "AuthorID": "55551003300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}}}
