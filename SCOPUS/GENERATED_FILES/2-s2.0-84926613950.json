The aim of this study was to assess clinical factors affecting responses to a low dose short synacthen test (LDSST) in asthmatic children using corticosteroids. Design Patients were recruited from secondary care paediatric asthma populations within the UK. Patients Asthmatic children (5-18 years), receiving corticosteroids, underwent a LDSST (n = 525). Measurements Demographics and corticosteroid doses were tested for association with baseline and peak (stimulated) cortisol concentrations. Results Baseline cortisol was significantly associated with age (log baseline increased 0\u00b704 nm per year of age, P < 0\u00b70001), but not with gender or corticosteroid dose. Peak cortisol was significantly associated with total corticosteroid cumulative dose (decreased 0\u00b773 nm per 200 mcg/day, P < 0\u00b7001) but not with age, gender inhaled/intranasal corticosteroid cumulative dose or number of courses of rescue corticosteroids. Biochemically impaired response (peak cortisol \u2264500 nm) occurred in 37\u00b70% (161/435) overall, including children using GINA low (200-500 mcg/day beclomethasone-CFC equivalent 32%, n = 60), medium (501-1000 mcg/day (33%, n = 57) and high (>1000 mcg/day 40%, n = 13) doses of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) similarly, and 36\u00b76% of those using fluticasone ICS \u2265500 mcg/day (71/194). Impaired response was more frequent in patients on regular oral corticosteroids (66%, n = 27, P < 0\u00b7001). Conclusion Children with asthma can develop biochemical adrenal suppression at similar frequencies for all ICS preparations and doses. The clinical consequence of biochemical suppression needs further study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Adolescent", "Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adrenal Glands", "Asthma", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cosyntropin", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Male", "Prevalence", "Steroids", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926613950", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"23993684800": {"Name": "Hawcutt D.B.", "AuthorID": "23993684800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "57191950914": {"Name": "Thompson B.", "AuthorID": "57191950914", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "8847131800": {"Name": "Jorgensen A.L.", "AuthorID": "8847131800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Liverpool"}, "55844546700": {"Name": "Wallin N.", "AuthorID": "55844546700", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006689429": {"Name": "Peak M.", "AuthorID": "7006689429", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36017035300": {"Name": "Lacy D.", "AuthorID": "36017035300", "AffiliationID": "60002627", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Medicine, Arrowe Park Hospital"}, "7004797670": {"Name": "Newland P.", "AuthorID": "7004797670", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603002071": {"Name": "Didi M.", "AuthorID": "6603002071", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7203040120": {"Name": "Blair J.", "AuthorID": "7203040120", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004204289": {"Name": "Couriel J.", "AuthorID": "7004204289", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102358057": {"Name": "Smyth R.L.", "AuthorID": "7102358057", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
