All rights reserved.Purpose of review Adults living with HIV have an increased risk of malignancy yet there is little data for adolescents and young adults. We reviewed recently published cancer epidemiology, treatment, and outcome data for adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYALHIV) aged 10 to less than 25 years between 2016 and 2017. Recent findings AYALHIV are at increased risk of developing cancer compared to their uninfected peers. Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur most frequently with variation by geographical region. Increased cancer risk is associated with HIV-related immunosuppression and coinfection with oncogenic viruses. Published data, particularly on posttreatment outcomes, remain limited and analyses are hampered by lack of data disaggregation by age and route of HIV transmission. Summary Although data are sparse, the increased cancer risk for AYALHIV is the cause for concern and must be modified by improving global access and uptake of antiretroviral therapy, human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, screening for hepatitis B and C infection, and optimized cancer screening programs. Education aimed at reducing traditional modifiable cancer risk factors should be embedded within multidisciplinary services for AYALHIV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "cancer", "HIV", "prevention", "young adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent Health", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045251959", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"6507302118": {"Name": "Bohlius J.", "AuthorID": "6507302118", "AffiliationID": "60105053, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"}, "55432677400": {"Name": "Foster C.", "AuthorID": "55432677400", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "900 and Family Clinics, Imperial College NHS Trust"}, "16234423600": {"Name": "Naidu G.", "AuthorID": "16234423600", "AffiliationID": "60027219, 60016218", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "55800160200": {"Name": "Sengayi M.", "AuthorID": "55800160200", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "26031175500": {"Name": "Turkova A.", "AuthorID": "26031175500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
