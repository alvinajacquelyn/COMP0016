All rights reserved.This article aims to describe the process of cross-cultural adaptation of the Determine Your Nutritional Health\u00ae (DNH) screening method for the elderly Brazilian population. The DNH consists of 10 questions with affirmative statements, to which specific scores are assigned and when added up correspond to the final score, which classifies individuals according to the presence or absence of nutritional risk. The process of cross-cultural adaptation of the DNH method involved the following stages: translation; back translation; semantic equivalence; evaluation by the experts; pre-test and final version of the method. Adjustments were made in words and expressions of the DNH method for the Brazilian reality. The final version of the method has been defined for Brazil as \u201cVerify the nutritional conditions of the elderly,\u201d presenting the same questions as in the original version of the DNH. It was in a clearer format, through questions, considered accessible and easy to understand, according to the assessment of health professionals and the elderly. The Brazilian version of the nutritional screening method, \u201cVerify nutritional conditions of the elderly,\u201d was translated and adapted, for use in Brazilian elderly in assisted living accommodation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-cultural adaptation", "Nutritional risk", "Nutritional screening"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011411629", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57188802361": {"Name": "Roediger M.D.A.", "AuthorID": "57188802361", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o, Faculdade de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica (FSP), Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (USP)"}, "55137903300": {"Name": "Marucci M.D.F.N.", "AuthorID": "55137903300", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o, Faculdade de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica (FSP), Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (USP)"}, "35447169500": {"Name": "Latorre M.D.R.D.D.O.", "AuthorID": "35447169500", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Epidemiologia, FSP, USP"}, "6603044711": {"Name": "Lebr\u00e3o M.L.", "AuthorID": "6603044711", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Epidemiologia, FSP, USP"}, "7006800882": {"Name": "Hearst N.", "AuthorID": "7006800882", "AffiliationID": "60031970, 60023691", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of California"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "De Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "16233162200": {"Name": "Duarte Y.A.D.O.", "AuthorID": "16233162200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Enfermagem M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica, Escola de Enfermagem, USP"}}}
