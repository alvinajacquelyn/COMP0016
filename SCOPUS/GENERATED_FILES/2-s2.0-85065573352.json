This conveys information processing from intracellular signaling networks enabling self-organization between other cells, typically involving mechanisms associated with cognitive systems. How information is integrated in a functional manner and its relationship with the different cell fates is still unclear. In parallel, drawn originally from studies on neuroscience, integrated information proposes an approach to quantify the balance between integration and differentiation in the causal dynamics among the elements in any interacting system. In this work, such an approach is considered to study the dynamical complexity in a genetic network of repressilators coupled by quorum sensing. Several attractors under different conditions are identified and related to proposed measures of integrated information to have an insight into the collective interaction and functional differentiation in cells. This research particularly accounts for the open question about the coding and information transmission in genetic systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell differentiation", "Clustering", "Complex dynamics", "Genetic regulatory networks", "Integrated information", "Repressilator", "Synchronization", "Synthetic biology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065573352", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57194695980": {"Name": "Abrego L.", "AuthorID": "57194695980", "AffiliationID": "60111768", "AffiliationName": "The Alan Turing Institute"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Pediatrics, Sechenov University"}}}
