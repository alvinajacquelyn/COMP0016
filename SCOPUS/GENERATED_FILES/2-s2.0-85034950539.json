The aim of this study was to assess experience, perceptions of acceptability, and formulation preferences, among 10 oral dosage forms for young children in a sample of end-users in Nigeria as an exemplar LMIC. Methods: Using a semi-structured and validated questionnaire, 148 caregivers were surveyed. Acceptability was assessed by level of liking using a 3-point Likert scale and ease of administration. Preference was assessed from participants\u2019 dosage form of choice. Oral dosage forms assessed were those mentioned in the British National Formulary for children, 2013. Results: The formulation perceived as the most acceptable was the chewable/suckable tablet. However, preference was for liquids. Specifically with the dispersible tablet, whilst 89% (n = 111) of caregivers of young children found it easy-to-administer, only 50% of children liked it. Conclusion: There is a gap between the proposal of dispersible tablet as the preferred dosage form for young children and caregivers\u2019 perceptions of acceptability and preference. Educational strategies to increase acceptability of dispersible tablets as the preferred formulation for young children would be required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceptability", "Children", "Dosage form preference", "Flexible solid oral dosage forms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Adult", "Caregivers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dosage Forms", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nigeria", "Parents", "Patient Preference", "Patient Satisfaction", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034950539", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57190123929": {"Name": "Orubu S.", "AuthorID": "57190123929", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "35722481500": {"Name": "Okwelogu C.", "AuthorID": "35722481500", "AffiliationID": "60006448", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lagos"}, "49864093600": {"Name": "Opanuga O.", "AuthorID": "49864093600", "AffiliationID": "60026284", "AffiliationName": "Lagos University Teaching Hospital"}}}
