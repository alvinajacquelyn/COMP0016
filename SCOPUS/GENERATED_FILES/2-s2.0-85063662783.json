In this article, the authors compare original ethnographic and ethnobotanical research among two different peoples from opposite extremes of lowland South America \u2013 the Makushi of Guyana and the Matsigenka of southern Peru \u2013 and explore how somatic experiences and the chemosensory properties of plants permeate indigenous understandings of the aetiology of illness and medical efficacy in both the cosmological and microbiological domains. The authors synthesize emerging theory in ecosemiotics, embodiment, plant personhood and plant intelligence with the concept of \u2018sensory ecology\u2019 to recast multispecies ethnography as a phytochemical as well as a philosophical endeavour.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063662783", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"56841294000": {"Name": "Daly L.", "AuthorID": "56841294000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "7004551662": {"Name": "Shepard G.", "AuthorID": "7004551662", "AffiliationID": "60011474", "AffiliationName": "Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi (MPEG) in Bel\u00e9m"}}}
