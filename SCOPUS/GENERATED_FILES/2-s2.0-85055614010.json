Aim This study aimed to investigate GPs' attitudes and willingness to use a FIT over an urgent 2-week wait (2WW) referral. Design and setting A cross-sectional online survey involving 1024 GPs working across England. Method Logistic regression models were used to explore the likelihood of GPs using a FIT instead of a 2WW referral, and reported using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results Just over one-third of GPs (n = 365) preferred to use a FIT as a rule-out test over a 2WW referral. GPs were more willing if they were: aged 36-45 years (OR 1.59 [95% CI = 1.04 to 2.44]); 46-55 years (OR 1.99 [95% CI = 1.14 to 3.47]); thought a FIT was highly accurate (OR 1.63 [95% CI = 1.16 to 2.29]); thought patients would benefit compared with having a colonoscopy (OR 2.02 [95% CI = 1.46 to 2.79]); and were highly confident about discussing the benefits of a FIT (OR 2.14 [95% CI = 1.46 to 3.16]). GPs were less willing if they had had >10 urgent referrals in the past year (OR 0.62 [95% CI = 0.40 to 0.94]) and thought that longer consultations would be needed (OR 0.61 [95% CI = 0.44 to 0.83]). Conclusion The study findings suggest that the acceptability of using a FIT as a rule-out test in primary care is currently low, with less than half of GPs who perceived the test to be accurate preferring it over colonoscopy. Any potential guideline changes recommending a FIT in patients with high-risk symptoms, instead of urgent referral to rule out CRC, are likely to require intensive supporting educational outreach to increase GP confidence in the accuracy and application of a FIT in this context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2-week wait", "Colorectal cancer", "Cross-sectional survey", "Faecal immunochemical test", "Primary care", "Symptomatic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Colonoscopy", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Early Detection of Cancer", "England", "Feces", "Female", "Humans", "Immunochemistry", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occult Blood", "Odds Ratio", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Primary Health Care", "Referral and Consultation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055614010", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"23029251000": {"Name": "Von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56136479100": {"Name": "Stoffel S.", "AuthorID": "56136479100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57193519692": {"Name": "Freeman M.", "AuthorID": "57193519692", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57204448012": {"Name": "Szinay D.", "AuthorID": "57204448012", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57073831200": {"Name": "Hirst Y.", "AuthorID": "57073831200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "6505965176": {"Name": "Sheringham J.", "AuthorID": "6505965176", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "55513725400": {"Name": "Laszlo H.", "AuthorID": "55513725400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Cancer Collaborative"}, "56108796900": {"Name": "Nicholson B.D.", "AuthorID": "56108796900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}}}
