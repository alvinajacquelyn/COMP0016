Methods We conducted a cross-sectional psychometric study of laryngectomy patients (minimum 3 months posttreatment) attending routine hospital follow-up for the psychometric evaluation of SOAL. Results One hundred ten people participated in this study. Thirteen percent of the patients had a laryngectomy, 63% had laryngectomy with radiotherapy, and 24% had laryngectomy with chemoradiation therapy. The SOAL showed good quality of data (minimal missing data and floor effects); good internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.91); and adequate test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.73). In terms of validity, it differentiated people by treatment group (F(2,85) = 8.02; p =.001) and diet texture group (t(102) = -7.33; p <.001). Conclusion The SOAL demonstrates good validity and has potential for use in research. Further study is required to determine its clinical application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["head and neck cancer", "laryngectomy", "patient-reported outcome measure", "psychometric evaluation", "swallowing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Deglutition", "Female", "Humans", "Laryngectomy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949871042", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"6506971856": {"Name": "Govender R.", "AuthorID": "6506971856", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "25927976100": {"Name": "Lee M.T.", "AuthorID": "25927976100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Cancer Centre, University College London, Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "6603959414": {"Name": "Drinnan M.", "AuthorID": "6603959414", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60026712", "AffiliationName": "Regional Medical Physics Department, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Freeman Hospital"}, "55534059200": {"Name": "Davies T.", "AuthorID": "55534059200", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Speech and Language Therapy, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust"}, "40162347700": {"Name": "Twinn C.", "AuthorID": "40162347700", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Guy's Hospital London"}, "55930807500": {"Name": "Hilari K.", "AuthorID": "55930807500", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Language and Communication Science, City University London"}}}
