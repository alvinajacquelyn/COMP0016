Methods: We obtained clinical histories of CSE and neurologic examination data among 1,196 people with ACE identified from a population of 379,166 people in 3 sites: Agincourt, South Africa; Iganga-Mayuge, Uganda; and Kilifi, Kenya. We performed serologic assessment for the presence of antibodies to parasitic infections and HIV and determined adherence to antiepileptic drugs. Consequences of CSE were assessed using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. Results: The adjusted prevalence of CSE in ACE among the general population across the 3 sites was 2.3 per 1,000, and differed with site (p < 0.0001). Over half (55%) of CSE occurred in febrile illnesses and focal seizures were present in 61%. Risk factors for CSE in ACE were neurologic impairments, acute encephalopathy, previous hospitalization, and presence of antibody titers to falciparum malaria and HIV; these differed across sites. Burns (15%), lack of education (49%), being single (77%), and unemployment (78%) were common in CSE; these differed across the 3 sites. Nine percent with and 10% without CSE died. Conclusions: CSE is common in people with ACE in Africa; most occurs with febrile illnesses, is untreated, and has focal features suggesting preventable risk factors. Effective prevention and the management of infections and neurologic impairments may reduce the burden of CSE in ACE.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antibodies, Protozoan", "Anticonvulsants", "Brain Diseases", "Burns", "Child", "Educational Status", "Epilepsy", "Female", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Kenya", "Logistic Models", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Male", "Marital Status", "Medication Adherence", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "South Africa", "Status Epilepticus", "Uganda", "Unemployment", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928905593", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57211654489": {"Name": "Kariuki S.M.", "AuthorID": "57211654489", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "23024198700": {"Name": "Chengo E.", "AuthorID": "23024198700", "AffiliationID": "112933000", "AffiliationName": "Studies of Epidemiology of Epilepsy in Demographic Surveillance Systems, INDEPTH Network"}, "54793261400": {"Name": "Kamuyu G.", "AuthorID": "54793261400", "AffiliationID": "112933000", "AffiliationName": "Studies of Epidemiology of Epilepsy in Demographic Surveillance Systems, INDEPTH Network"}, "57195257618": {"Name": "Ngugi A.K.", "AuthorID": "57195257618", "AffiliationID": "60065498", "AffiliationName": "Research Support Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aga Khan University"}, "35465836500": {"Name": "Newton C.R.J.", "AuthorID": "35465836500", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60138292", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "24071127800": {"Name": "Kakooza-Mwesige A.", "AuthorID": "24071127800", "AffiliationID": "115241108", "AffiliationName": "Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health"}, "55572977000": {"Name": "Wagner R.G.", "AuthorID": "55572977000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Global Health, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University"}, "7404080163": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "7404080163", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "35971342000": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "35971342000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland-SEIN"}}}
