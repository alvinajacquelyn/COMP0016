Siogkas et al.Pressure measurements using finite element computations without the need of a wire could be valuable in clinical practice. Our aim was to compare the computed distal coronary pressure values with the measured values using a pressure wire, while testing the effect of different boundary conditions for the simulation. Eight coronary arteries (lumen and outer vessel wall) from six patients were reconstructed in three-dimensional (3D) space using intravascular ultrasound and biplane angiographic images. Pressure values at the distal and proximal end of the vessel and flow velocity values at the distal end were acquired with the use of a combo pressure-flow wire. The 3D lumen and wall models were discretized into finite elements; fluid structure interaction (FSI) and rigid wall simulations were performed for one cardiac cycle both with pulsatile and steady flow in separate simulations. The results showed a high correlation between the measured and the computed coronary pressure values (coefficient of determination [r2] ranging between 0.8902 and 0.9961), while the less demanding simulations using steady flow and rigid walls resulted in very small relative error. Our study demonstrates that computational assessment of coronary pressure is feasible and seems to be accurate compared to the wire-based measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Computer Simulation", "Coronary Vessels", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Ultrasonography, Interventional"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925310740", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"36976596100": {"Name": "Siogkas P.K.", "AuthorID": "36976596100", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, Department of Materials Science, University of Ioannina"}, "36476633700": {"Name": "Sakellarios A.I.", "AuthorID": "36476633700", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, Department of Materials Science, University of Ioannina"}, "56962785500": {"Name": "Athanasiou L.S.", "AuthorID": "56962785500", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, Department of Materials Science, University of Ioannina"}, "55938920100": {"Name": "Fotiadis D.I.", "AuthorID": "55938920100", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Institute-FORTH, University of Ioannina"}, "9333515500": {"Name": "Papafaklis M.I.", "AuthorID": "9333515500", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Michailideion Cardiac Center, University of Ioannina"}, "54684557500": {"Name": "Naka K.K.", "AuthorID": "54684557500", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Michailideion Cardiac Center, University of Ioannina"}, "7003871803": {"Name": "Michalis L.K.", "AuthorID": "7003871803", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Michailideion Cardiac Center, University of Ioannina"}, "36976271000": {"Name": "Stefanou K.A.", "AuthorID": "36976271000", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Institute-FORTH, University of Ioannina"}, "8907555000": {"Name": "Exarchos T.P.", "AuthorID": "8907555000", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Institute-FORTH, University of Ioannina"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thoraxcenter, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "7006854902": {"Name": "Parodi O.", "AuthorID": "7006854902", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche (IFC-CNR)"}}}
