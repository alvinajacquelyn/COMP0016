The authors found that this pathway is activated during the integrated stress response. tRNA nuclear import was selective to certain tRNA species and may contribute to the changes in protein translation known to protect cells from stress.\u00a9 2019 The Author(s) In eukaryotes, tRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus and exported to the cytosol, where they deliver amino acids to ribosomes for protein translation. This nuclear-cytoplasmic movement was believed to be unidirectional. However, active shuttling of tRNAs, named tRNA retrograde transport, between the cytosol and nucleus has been discovered. This pathway is conserved in eukaryotes, suggesting a fundamental function; however, little is known about its role in human cells. Here we report that, in human cells, oxidative stress triggers tRNA retrograde transport, which is rapid, reversible, and selective for certain tRNA species, mostly with shorter 3\u2032 ends. Retrograde transport of tRNA SeC , which promotes translation of selenoproteins required to maintain homeostatic redox levels in cells, is highly efficient. tRNA retrograde transport is regulated by the integrated stress response pathway via the PERK-REDD1-mTOR axis. Thus, we propose that tRNA retrograde transport is part of the cellular response to oxidative stress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fluorescence in situ hybridization", "mTOR", "nucleus", "oxidative stress", "PKR", "REDD1", "retrograde transport", "tRNA", "unfolded protein response"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Nucleus", "Cytoplasm", "eIF-2 Kinase", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Oxidative Stress", "RNA Transport", "RNA, Transfer", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062701294", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36810409500": {"Name": "Schwenzer H.", "AuthorID": "36810409500", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "57207685877": {"Name": "Chu A.", "AuthorID": "57207685877", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "55613142700": {"Name": "Pallett L.J.", "AuthorID": "55613142700", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "6701807360": {"Name": "Fassati A.", "AuthorID": "6701807360", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "25932290100": {"Name": "J\u00fchling F.", "AuthorID": "25932290100", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1110, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies Virales et H\u00e9patiques, 2 Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "7003462926": {"Name": "Baumert T.F.", "AuthorID": "7003462926", "AffiliationID": "60018868, 60011024", "AffiliationName": "Nouvel H\u00f4pital Civil, Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire"}}}
