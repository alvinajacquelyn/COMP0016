Progression of vaccine candidates to efficacy trials against TB disease rests on demonstration of safety and immunogenicity in target populations and protection against challenge in preclinical models, but immunologic correlates of protection are unknown, and animal models may not be predictive of results in humans. Even in populations most heavily affected by TB the sample sizes required for Phase 2b efficacy trials using TB disease as an endpoint are in the thousands. Novel clinical trial models have been developed to evaluate candidate TB vaccines in selected populations using biologically relevant outcomes and innovative statistical approaches. Such proof of concept studies can be used to more rationally select vaccine candidates for advancement to large scale trials against TB disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical development", "Prevention of infection", "Prevention of recurrence", "Proof of concept", "Trial design", "Tuberculosis", "Vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Diffusion of Innovation", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Patient Selection", "Recurrence", "Research Design", "Risk Factors", "Sample Size", "Tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis Vaccines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929292991", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57198586041": {"Name": "Ellis R.D.", "AuthorID": "57198586041", "AffiliationID": "110274275", "AffiliationName": "Aeras"}, "54891353500": {"Name": "Snowden M.", "AuthorID": "54891353500", "AffiliationID": "110274275", "AffiliationName": "Aeras"}, "7401453852": {"Name": "Evans T.", "AuthorID": "7401453852", "AffiliationID": "110274275", "AffiliationName": "Aeras"}, "7006372530": {"Name": "Ginsberg A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006372530", "AffiliationID": "110274275", "AffiliationName": "Aeras"}, "57204295879": {"Name": "Hatherill M.", "AuthorID": "57204295879", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine (IDM), University of Cape Town"}, "56564969600": {"Name": "Tait D.", "AuthorID": "56564969600", "AffiliationID": "115240080", "AffiliationName": "Aeras"}, "7004276892": {"Name": "Churchyard G.", "AuthorID": "7004276892", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand"}, "6603950018": {"Name": "Hanekom W.", "AuthorID": "6603950018", "AffiliationID": "60022241", "AffiliationName": "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}}}
