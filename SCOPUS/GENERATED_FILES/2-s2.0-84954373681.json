Study focus: The distribution of F across eight crystalline phases and between the bedrock and the regolith at eleven sites in three catchments is documented. Mineral contributions to F release during weathering and regolith development are quantified. New hydrological insights for the region: An estimate of weathering duration for the in situ regolith in Andhra Pradesh, 250-380 Ka, is close to a previous estimate for southern India. Partial or total destruction of the primary F-bearing bedrock minerals and consistent depletion of F in the remnant minerals result in a much reduced total F content in the regolith. Leaching experiments and field relationships, however, indicate a greater potential for F mobilisation to groundwater from the regolith than the bedrock. Schemes for managed aquifer recharge should beware the risk of mobilising additional F to groundwater.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaen", "Fluoride", "Groundwater", "India", "Regolith", "Sri Lanka"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954373681", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"56728474800": {"Name": "Hallett B.", "AuthorID": "56728474800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7101948586": {"Name": "Burgess W.", "AuthorID": "7101948586", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6507390973": {"Name": "Dharmagunawardhane H.", "AuthorID": "6507390973", "AffiliationID": "60071082", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Peradeniya"}, "14026608800": {"Name": "Atal S.", "AuthorID": "14026608800", "AffiliationID": "60005720", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute"}, "55330653200": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "55330653200", "AffiliationID": "60005720", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute"}, "6701734089": {"Name": "Valsami-Jones E.", "AuthorID": "6701734089", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
