This upregulation, demonstrated for both synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPARs, depends on the protein kinase C alpha (PKC\u03b1) activation; hence, spinal PKC inhibition has alleviated peripheral nociceptive hypersensitivity. However, whether targeting the spinal PKC\u03b1 would alleviate both pain development and maintenance has not been explored yet (essential to pharmacological translation). Similarly, if it could balance the upregulated postsynaptic CP-AMPARs also remains unknown. Here, we utilized pharmacological and genetic inhibition of spinal PKC\u03b1 in various schemes of pain treatment in an animal model of long-lasting peripheral inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition (pre- or post-treatment) reduced the peripheral nociceptive hypersensitivity and accompanying locomotive deficit and anxiety in rats with induced inflammation. These effects were dose-dependent and observed for both pain development and maintenance. Gene-therapy (knockdown of PKC\u03b1) was also found to relieve inflammatory pain when applied as pre- or post-treatment. Moreover, the revealed therapeutic effects were accompanied with the declined upregulation of CP-AMPARs at the DH synapses between primary afferents and sensory interneurons. Our results provide a new focus on the mechanism-based pain treatment through interference with molecular mechanisms of AMPAR trafficking in central pain pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Silencing", "Inflammation", "Interneurons", "Male", "Pain", "Pain Management", "Posterior Horn Cells", "Protein Kinase C-alpha", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Receptors, AMPA", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Spinal Cord", "Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049627670", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"12139633200": {"Name": "Kopach O.", "AuthorID": "12139633200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56939252500": {"Name": "Krotov V.", "AuthorID": "56939252500", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sensory Signalling, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "57202871028": {"Name": "Sotnic A.", "AuthorID": "57202871028", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sensory Signalling, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "15521278800": {"Name": "Viatchenko-Karpinski V.", "AuthorID": "15521278800", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "7006963590": {"Name": "Voitenko N.", "AuthorID": "7006963590", "AffiliationID": "100569502", "AffiliationName": "Kyiv Academic University"}, "6603400732": {"Name": "Shysh A.", "AuthorID": "6603400732", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of General and Molecular Pathophysiology, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "6602523327": {"Name": "Dosenko V.", "AuthorID": "6602523327", "AffiliationID": "100569502", "AffiliationName": "Kyiv Academic University"}}}
