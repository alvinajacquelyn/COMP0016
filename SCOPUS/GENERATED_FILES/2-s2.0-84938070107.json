Their effects range from increased chemical reactivity to enhanced mechanical properties. Dislocations have been widely studied using traditional techniques such as X-ray diffraction and optical imaging. Recent advances have enabled atomic force microscopy to study single dislocations in two dimensions, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can now visualize strain fields in three dimensions with near-atomic resolution. However, these techniques cannot offer three-dimensional imaging of the formation or movement of dislocations during dynamic processes. Here, we describe how Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI; refs,) can be used to visualize in three dimensions, the entire network of dislocations present within an individual calcite crystal during repeated growth and dissolution cycles. These investigations demonstrate the potential of BCDI for studying the mechanisms underlying the response of crystalline materials to external stimuli.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic resolution", "Coherent diffraction imaging", "Crystal growth and dissolution", "Dislocation propagation", "Macroscopic properties", "Single dislocation", "Three dimensional imaging", "Traditional techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938070107", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"24597708500": {"Name": "Clark J.N.", "AuthorID": "24597708500", "AffiliationID": "60030635", "AffiliationName": "Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (DESY)"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "112946654", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "55625772100": {"Name": "Ihli J.", "AuthorID": "55625772100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "55261828300": {"Name": "Schenk A.S.", "AuthorID": "55261828300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "7410210439": {"Name": "Kim Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "7410210439", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "7006553128": {"Name": "Kulak A.N.", "AuthorID": "7006553128", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "7004934495": {"Name": "Meldrum F.C.", "AuthorID": "7004934495", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "55077170600": {"Name": "Campbell J.M.", "AuthorID": "55077170600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds"}, "6506096326": {"Name": "Nisbet G.", "AuthorID": "6506096326", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
