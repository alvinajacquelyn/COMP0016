The RRP/extended is a time-constrained project scheduling problem, in which the total project cost is minimised. In the RRP/extended, this total project cost is determined by a number of extra costs, which are defined in this paper. These costs are based on the costs that are used in the traditional Resource Renting Problem and the Total Adjustment Cost Problem. Therefore, the RRP/extended represents a union of these two problems. To solve the RRP/extended, a scatter search is developed. The building blocks of this scatter search are specifically designed for the RRP/extended. We introduce two crossovers and an improvement method. The efficiency of these building blocks will be shown in the paper. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is presented in which the five costs have diverse values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["project scheduling", "renting costs", "resource scheduling", "scatter search"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjustment costs", "Building blockes", "Improvement methods", "Project cost", "Project scheduling", "Project scheduling problem", "Resource-scheduling", "Scatter search"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936972565", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"56719689100": {"Name": "Vandenheede L.", "AuthorID": "56719689100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University"}, "6602303040": {"Name": "Vanhoucke M.", "AuthorID": "6602303040", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Science and Innovation, University College London"}, "22980289500": {"Name": "Maenhout B.", "AuthorID": "22980289500", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University"}}}
