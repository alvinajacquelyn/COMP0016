Fluid balance is pivotal in the management of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on dialysis. Although many techniques are available to assess fluid status, there are only a few studies for children, of which none have been comparable against cardiovascular outcome measures. Methods. We performed a longitudinal study in 30 children with CKD5-5D and 13 age-matched healthy controls (71 measurements) to determine a correlation between optimal weight by bioimpedance spectroscopy (Wt-BIS) and clinical assessment (Wt-CA). The accuracy ofWt-BIS [relative overhydration (Rel-OH)] was compared against indicators of fluid status and cardiovascularmeasures. Results. There was poor agreement between Wt-CA and Wt-BIS in children on dialysis (P0.01), but not in CKD5 or control subjects. We developed a modified chart to plot Rel-OH against systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score for the appropriate representation of volume status and blood pressure (BP) in children. In total, 25% of measurements showed SBP>90th percentile but not with concurrent overhydration. Rel-OH correlated with peripheral pulse pressure (P0.03; R0.3), higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (P0.02; R0.33) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P0.05; R0.38). Central aortic mean and pulse pressure significantly associated with the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P0.03; R0.47 and P0.01; R0.50, respectively), but not with Rel-OH. SBP was positively associated with pulse wave velocity z-score (P0.04). In total, 40% of children on haemodialysis and 30% on peritoneal dialysis had increased left ventricularmass index. Conclusions. BIS provides an objective method for the assessment of hydration status in children on dialysis. We noted a marked discrepancy between BP and hydration status in children on dialysis that warrants further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "chronic kidney disease", "dialysis", "hydration status", "hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electric Impedance", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Renal Dialysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Water-Electrolyte Balance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047333797", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57202149846": {"Name": "Eng C.S.Y.", "AuthorID": "57202149846", "AffiliationID": "60029773", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology Unit, Tuanku Ja'afar Hospital"}, "57202150940": {"Name": "Mayes M.", "AuthorID": "57202150940", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55443241900": {"Name": "Stronach L.", "AuthorID": "55443241900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202153037": {"Name": "Blaauw M.", "AuthorID": "57202153037", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202151586": {"Name": "Barber A.", "AuthorID": "57202151586", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.C.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Physiology Unit, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "55212324000": {"Name": "Bhowruth D.", "AuthorID": "55212324000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Physiology Unit, University College London Institute of Child Health"}}}
