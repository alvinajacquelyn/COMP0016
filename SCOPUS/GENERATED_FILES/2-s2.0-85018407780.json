There is no research regarding the other foods and drinks consumed alongside SSBs by young people. The aim of this paper is to explore the patterns of SSB purchase and consumption amongst young people aged 13\u201315 years. Methods A purchasing recall questionnaire (PRQ) was administered online in seven case study schools with 535 young people aged 13\u201315 years. Nutrient composition (kilocalories, fat, saturated fat, sodium and sugar) was also calculated for food/drink purchases. Chi-Square and Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney tests were conducted to examine patterns of SSB consumption and sugar/kilocalories consumption for SSB consumers and non-consumers. Results SSB consumers were significantly more likely to consume a drink at mid-morning break. Fewer consumed food at mid-morning break, ate food before school or ate food at lunchtime, but this was not statistically significant. A higher percentage of SSB consumers consumed \u2018unhealthy\u2019 food and drinks in comparison to young people who did not consume a SSB. Both median lunchtime sugar consumption (40.7 g vs 10.2 g) and median sugar as a percentage of Kcals (39% vs 14%) were significantly higher for SSB purchasers in comparison to non-purchasers. Conclusion The analysis highlights that SSB purchasers consume significantly more sugar at lunchtime than non-purchasers. However, both purchasers and non-purchasers exceeded WHO (2015) recommendations that sugar consumption be halved to form no more than 5% of daily energy intake. This study provides new insights for public health stakeholders and schools. Multifaceted and inventive strategies relevant to young people will be required to achieve the new WHO recommendations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consumption", "Energy drinks", "Food and drink purchasing", "Sugar", "Sugar-sweetened beverages", "Young people"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Beverages", "Diet", "Dietary Sugars", "Female", "Humans", "Lunch", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Nutrition Assessment", "Nutrition Surveys", "Nutritive Sweeteners", "Nutritive Value", "Schools", "Scotland", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018407780", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56596219100": {"Name": "Hamilton L.K.", "AuthorID": "56596219100", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire"}, "9738440100": {"Name": "Wills W.J.", "AuthorID": "9738440100", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
