The reference group was set up to consult children about the design of a research project which seeks to evoke, represent and understand children\u2019s views of psychotherapy. No work to date has explored the experience of reference groups in the context of child psychotherapy in residential care in Malta. The paper contextualises the research within the literature on reference groups in child research, which identifies the potential of reference groups as a participative and co-reflexive activity which can inform research design. The paper critically examines the nature and conduct of the reference group by acknowledging the specific context of this work rather than assuming this is necessarily positive. It does so by specifying and evaluating the outcomes of the reference group in line with its aims. The paper draws on the recordings of the reference group meetings and reference group field notes taken by the researcher as key data which were thematically analysed. The main outcomes of the reference group include children\u2019s contribution to the design of data collection methods especially in terms of not relying only on words during data collection. Children also identified key ethical issues from the point of view of young psychotherapy service users, especially in relation to issues of trust within a residential care context. Children also reviewed and appraised research information material. The reference group process drew from the researcher\u2019s and participants\u2019 contexts and contributed significantly to the researcher\u2019s reflexive process especially in terms of acknowledging his power and positioning as an adult and his dual role as a practitioner/researcher.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child participation", "children\u2019s views of psychotherapy", "looked after children", "Reference groups", "residential care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052151844", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56451660900": {"Name": "Mercieca D.", "AuthorID": "56451660900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57211027538": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "57211027538", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
