However, to date the effects of VTA-DBS on cognition, mood and quality of life have not been examined in detail. Methods: The aim of the present study was to do so in a case series of 18 consecutive patients with cluster headache who underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the ventral tegmental area. The patients were evaluated preoperatively and after a mean of 14 months of VTA-DBS on tests of global cognition (Mini Mental State Examination), intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-II), executive function (Delis\u2013Kaplan Executive Function System), and attention (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). Depression (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale-D), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale-A), apathy (Starkstein Apathy Scale), and hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale) were also assessed. Subjective pain experience (McGill Pain Questionnaire), behaviour (Pain Behaviour Checklist) and quality of life (Short Form-36) were also evaluated at the same time points. Results: VTA-DBS resulted in significant improvement of headache frequency (from a mean of five to two attacks daily, p <.001) and severity (from mean Verbal Rating Scale [VRS] of 10 to 7, p <.001) which was associated with significant reduction of anxiety (from mean HADS-A of 11.94 to 8.00, p <.001) and help-seeking behaviours (from mean PBC of 4.00 to 2.61, p <.001). VTA-DBS did not produce any significant change to any tests of cognitive function and any other outcome measures (BDI, HADS-D, SAS, BHS, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Short Form-36). Conclusion: We confirm the efficacy of VTA-DBS in the treatment of medically refractory chronic cluster headache. The reduction of headache frequency and severity was associated with a significant reduction of anxiety. Furthermore, the result suggests that VTA-DBS for chronic cluster headache improves pain-related help-seeking behaviours and does not produce any change in cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "cognition", "DBS", "Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia", "VTA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affect", "Aged", "Cluster Headache", "Cognition", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Help-Seeking Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventral Tegmental Area"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063326476", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57188656721": {"Name": "Cappon D.", "AuthorID": "57188656721", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Division of Cognitive Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "55914869900": {"Name": "Ryterska A.", "AuthorID": "55914869900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23768093200": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "23768093200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57204578076": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "57204578076", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55391746100": {"Name": "Lagrata S.", "AuthorID": "55391746100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache and Facial Pain Group, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36544229100": {"Name": "Miller S.", "AuthorID": "36544229100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache and Facial Pain Group, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6701699175": {"Name": "Matharu M.", "AuthorID": "6701699175", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache and Facial Pain Group, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
