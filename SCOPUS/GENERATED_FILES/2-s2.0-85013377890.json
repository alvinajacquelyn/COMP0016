This article presents a novel cognitive computational model of a backward inhibition mechanism. By combining aspects of previous cognitive models in task switching and conflict monitoring, the model instantiates the theoretical proposal that backward inhibition is the direct result of conflict between multiple task representations. In a first simulation, we demonstrate that the model produces two effects widely observed in the empirical literature, specifically, reaction time costs for both (n-1) task switches and n-2 task repeats. Through a systematic search of parameter space, we demonstrate that these effects are a general property of the model's theoretical content, and not specific parameter settings. We further demonstrate that the model captures previously reported empirical effects of inter-trial interval on n-2 switch costs. A final simulation extends the paradigm of switching between tasks of asymmetric difficulty to three tasks, and generates novel predictions for n-2 repetition costs. Specifically, the model predicts that n-2 repetition costs associated with hard-easy-hard alternations are greater than for easy-hard-easy alternations. Finally, we report two behavioural experiments testing this hypothesis, with results consistent with the model predictions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Conflict (Psychology)", "Cues", "Female", "Humans", "Inhibition (Psychology)", "Judgment", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Psychological", "Reaction Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013377890", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"56295310700": {"Name": "Sexton N.J.", "AuthorID": "56295310700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognition, Computation and Modelling, Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57209315902": {"Name": "Cooper R.P.", "AuthorID": "57209315902", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognition, Computation and Modelling, Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
