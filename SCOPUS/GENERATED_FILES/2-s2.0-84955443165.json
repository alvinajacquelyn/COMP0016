A review of recent technical and clinical neuroscience is provided to give a state-of-the-art overview. We then propose a closed-loop system concept using an accelerometer and a phase locked loop algorithm as a conceptual methodology for enhanced therapy systems. The remaining challenges to practical implementation are then briefly described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Control systems", "Essential Tremor", "inertial sensors", "movement disorders", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical neuroscience", "Essential tremor", "Inertial sensor", "Movement disorders", "Parkinson's disease", "State of the art", "Stimulation strategies", "System concepts"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955443165", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35106770100": {"Name": "Cagnan H.", "AuthorID": "35106770100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57196955203": {"Name": "Brown P.", "AuthorID": "57196955203", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "55903046400": {"Name": "Bourget D.", "AuthorID": "55903046400", "AffiliationID": "107853300", "AffiliationName": "Medtronic Neuromodulation"}, "6603392339": {"Name": "Denison T.", "AuthorID": "6603392339", "AffiliationID": "107853300", "AffiliationName": "Medtronic Neuromodulation"}}}
