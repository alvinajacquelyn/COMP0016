China has abundant biomass potential implying the bioenergy should be an important option of non-fossil energy. In this analysis, we present an representative biogas project (the Deqingyuan project, DQY) in Beijing and conduct a cost-benefit analysis for the whole value chain. DQY is the first large-scale biogas project in China that utilizes 100% chicken manure as a feedstock and integrates biogas production with ecological agriculture using advanced technologies. DQY uses 80,000 t of chicken manure and 100,000 t of sewage each year to produce biogas, which generates 14 million KWh of power annually, and obtains an additional revenue of RMB 8 million yuan each year through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Operating as an example of a sustainable bioenergy model, DQY accomplishes the full use of a recycled resource while showing consideration for animal welfare during the entire production, which is a fundamental component of the new rural energy strategy. The circular economy model of DQY plays a prominent role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating pollution, and increasing employment, among other benefits. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the typical demonstration model (DQY) in utilization of agricultural waste in China, and further proposes a general development model of Chinese biogas in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biogas project", "Biomass energy", "Circular economy", "Cost-benefit analysis", "Renewable energy policy", "Sustainability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bio-mass energy", "Biogas projects", "Circular economy", "Clean Development Mechanism", "Comprehensive analysis", "Ecological agricultures", "Renewable energy policy", "Total energy consumption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019022865", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"54408106600": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "54408106600", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University"}, "55667581600": {"Name": "Shu B.", "AuthorID": "55667581600", "AffiliationID": "60004691", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Geomatics and Planning, Jiangsu Normal University"}, "24467425700": {"Name": "Cong R.", "AuthorID": "24467425700", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}}}
