However, most of the methods to fabricate the extreme wettability materials involve toxic chemical reagents, complex chemical reaction processes, and dangerous operation processes. A new acid, alkali, and organic reagent-free cement-coated mesh was presented for the sustained separation of oil and water from oil/water mixtures. The meshes were fabricated by dipping porous Cu meshes in the cement paste. The micro/nanostructures and hydroxyl groups of the cement enable the meshes to be superhydrophilic in air and superoleophobic under water. The separation efficiencies for oils with a wide range of kinematic viscosities (0.42-74.4 cSt at 40 \u00b0C) were all above 94%. The superhydrophilic cement-coated meshes could separate the oil/water mixture containing hot water, salt, and alkali for at least 30 cycles. The superoleophobicity of the cement-coated meshes was intact under seawater for at least 120 hours, showing good durability and stability. This green fabrication method is easy, cost-effective and environment-friendly.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex chemical reactions", "Environment friendly", "Fabrication method", "Industrial wastewaters", "Micro/nanostructures", "Oil/water mixtures", "Oil/water separation", "Separation efficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041209243", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"37077947000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "37077947000", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57195986865": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "57195986865", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57201577745": {"Name": "Zhao C.", "AuthorID": "57201577745", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55475654800": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "55475654800", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55547135343": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "55547135343", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology, Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57197879442": {"Name": "Roy T.", "AuthorID": "57197879442", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nano-and-Microfluidics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36197988900": {"Name": "Deng X.", "AuthorID": "36197988900", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
