As the so-called collegial department model is increasingly overlapping with the traditional chair system, variations in practices are detectable according to disciplines and types of institutions. Based on qualitative data gathered in the framework of the ESF EuroAC project, this research shows, on the one side, how traditionally differentiated academic recruitment practices tend to converge through standardization and, on the other side, how differences between universities, institutes of technology and universities of applied sciences as well as differences among disciplines \u2014 e.g. hard-soft \u2014 impact on pace and depth of such change.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944097500", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"35772284300": {"Name": "Fumasoli T.", "AuthorID": "35772284300", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "ARENA \u2014 Centre for European Studies, University of Oslo"}, "23990714300": {"Name": "Goastellec G.", "AuthorID": "23990714300", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Observatory Science, Policy and Society, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Lausanne"}}}
