Material and methods: Eighty subjects were selected based on their periodontal status and were divided into 4 groups of 20 each; periodontally healthy, mild periodontitis, moderate periodontitis and severe periodontitis. In addition, demographic data, smoking status and socioeconomic status were also recorded. Results: The highest mean PISA value was obtained for the severe periodontitis group (2309.42 \u00b1 587.69 mm2) and the least for the periodontally healthy (34.30 \u00b1 16.48 mm2). The PISA values corresponding to the three categories of periodontitis severity were significantly higher than the periodontally healthy group. When receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, a PISA value \u2265130.33 mm2 predicted the presence of periodontitis with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusions: PISA is a periodontal parameter that may be used in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2013American Academy of Periodontology case definition classification in periodontal medicine research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA)", "periodontal inflammation", "periodontitis", "population surveillance", "prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Periodontal Pocket", "Periodontitis", "Periodontium", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Social Class", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033720632", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56707470700": {"Name": "Leira Y.", "AuthorID": "56707470700", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, Odontolog\u00eda M\u00e9dico-Quir\u00fargica (OMEQUI) Research Group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "57061663300": {"Name": "Blanco J.", "AuthorID": "57061663300", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, Odontolog\u00eda M\u00e9dico-Quir\u00fargica (OMEQUI) Research Group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "55668882800": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn-Lancharro P.", "AuthorID": "55668882800", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Statistics Unit, Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario"}}}
