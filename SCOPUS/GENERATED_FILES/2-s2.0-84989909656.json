In this analysis, we identified several large regions of homozygosity shared between both affected siblings, which we suggested could be candidate loci for a recessive genetic lesion underlying the early onset AD in these cases. We have now performed exome sequencing in one of these siblings and identified the potential cause of disease: the CTSF c.1243G>A:p.Gly415Arg mutation in homozygosity. Biallelic mutations in this gene have been shown to cause Type B Kufs disease, an adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with some cases resembling the impairment seen in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CTSF", "Early onset Alzheimer's disease", "Exome sequencing", "Homozygosity", "Kufs disease", "Recessive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cathepsin F", "Consanguinity", "Exome", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses", "Sequence Analysis", "Siblings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989909656", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57200436456": {"Name": "Bras J.", "AuthorID": "57200436456", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences and Institute of Biomedicine \u2013 iBiMED, University of Aveiro"}, "57191418009": {"Name": "Alves A.M.", "AuthorID": "57191418009", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56528431600": {"Name": "Darwent L.", "AuthorID": "56528431600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57200994996": {"Name": "Guerreiro R.", "AuthorID": "57200994996", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences and Institute of Biomedicine \u2013 iBiMED, University of Aveiro"}, "7004757531": {"Name": "Djaldetti R.", "AuthorID": "7004757531", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "57203050579": {"Name": "Mead S.", "AuthorID": "57203050579", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6701565311": {"Name": "Lleo A.", "AuthorID": "6701565311", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "CIBERNED, Center for Networked Biomedical Research into Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "56186408100": {"Name": "Blesa R.", "AuthorID": "56186408100", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60009466", "AffiliationName": "Memory Unit, Neurology Department and Sant Pau Biomedical Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "57195450094": {"Name": "Clarimon J.", "AuthorID": "57195450094", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60009466", "AffiliationName": "Memory Unit, Neurology Department and Sant Pau Biomedical Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "6701588028": {"Name": "Molinuevo J.L.", "AuthorID": "6701588028", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814, 60104667", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Institute of Neurosciences, Hospital Cl\u00ednic i Universitari de Barcelona, IDIBAPS"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}}}
