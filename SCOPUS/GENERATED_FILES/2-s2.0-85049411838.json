No claim to original U.S. Government WorksDementia is a major social and economic problem for our aging population. One of the most common causes of dementia in the elderly is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Magnetic resonance scans of SVD patients typically show white matter abnormalities, but we do not understand the mechanistic pathological link between blood vessels and white matter myelin damage. Hypertension is suggested as the cause of sporadic SVD, but a recent alternative hypothesis invokes dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier as the primary cause. In a rat model of SVD, we show that endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is the first change in development of the disease. Dysfunctional ECs secrete heat shock protein 90, which blocks oligodendroglial differentiation, contributing to impaired myelination. Treatment with EC-stabilizing drugs reversed these EC and oligodendroglial pathologies in the rat model. EC and oligodendroglial dysfunction were also observed in humans with early, asymptomatic SVD pathology. We identified a loss-of-function mutation in ATPase11B, which caused the EC dysfunction in the rat SVD model, and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ATPase11B that was associated with white matter abnormalities in humans with SVD. We show that EC dysfunction is a cause of SVD white matter vulnerability and provide a therapeutic strategy to treat and reverse SVD in the rat model, which may also be of relevance to human SVD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Cell Proliferation", "Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endothelial Cells", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Homozygote", "HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Rats", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049411838", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193571263": {"Name": "Rajani R.M.", "AuthorID": "57193571263", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Centre for Regenerative Medicine, UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57202801124": {"Name": "Quick S.", "AuthorID": "57202801124", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Centre for Regenerative Medicine, UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "56998678000": {"Name": "Ruigrok S.R.", "AuthorID": "56998678000", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Centre for Regenerative Medicine, UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "8151885300": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "8151885300", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Centre for Regenerative Medicine, UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "7403477386": {"Name": "Graham D.", "AuthorID": "7403477386", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "In-stitute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57203682077": {"Name": "Dominiczak A.F.", "AuthorID": "57203682077", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "In-stitute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7403484635": {"Name": "Harris S.E.", "AuthorID": "7403484635", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "36024825500": {"Name": "Verhaaren B.F.J.", "AuthorID": "36024825500", "AffiliationID": "120931819", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Working Group, Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)"}, "6602465971": {"Name": "Fornage M.", "AuthorID": "6602465971", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center"}, "57211936432": {"Name": "Seshadri S.", "AuthorID": "57211936432", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Boston University, School of Medicine"}, "25627517600": {"Name": "Atanur S.S.", "AuthorID": "25627517600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "56883384000": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "56883384000", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neuropa-thology, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "35417533500": {"Name": "Wardlaw J.M.", "AuthorID": "35417533500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}}}
