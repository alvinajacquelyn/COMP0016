All rights reserved.This single case study examines selective Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) binding to an intracerebral light-chain amyloidoma using a 90-minute dynamic [ 11 C]PiB-PET scan and brain biopsy tissue. Parametric non-displaceable binding potential (BP ND) images showed low specific binding in the amyloidoma (BP ND = 0.23), while relative tracer delivery was adequate (R 1 = 0.44). Histology of the tissue revealed strong coloring with Congo-red, thioflavin-S, and X-34, indicating presence of amyloid. However, immunological staining with 6F/3D revealed absence of amyloid-\u03b2 and histofluorescence of 6-CN-PiB, a highly fluorescent derivative of PiB, was at background levels. Our results suggest that PiB does not detect the atypical amyloid pathology associated with an intracerebral light-chain amyloidoma. These findings are of interest to clinicians and researchers applying [ 11 C]PiB-PET to detect atypical forms of amyloid pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid", "case study", "histology", "positron emission tomography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051872694", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57002955900": {"Name": "Groot C.", "AuthorID": "57002955900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "57202308863": {"Name": "Boon B.", "AuthorID": "57202308863", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, VU University Medical Center"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "23010377900": {"Name": "Tolboom N.", "AuthorID": "23010377900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7005884819": {"Name": "Lammertsma A.", "AuthorID": "7005884819", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "6603412407": {"Name": "Van Berckel B.", "AuthorID": "6603412407", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "6602721302": {"Name": "Rozemuller A.", "AuthorID": "6602721302", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603795116": {"Name": "Ikonomovic M.", "AuthorID": "6603795116", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Administration Pittsburgh Healthcare System"}, "57203043891": {"Name": "Klunk W.", "AuthorID": "57203043891", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}}}
