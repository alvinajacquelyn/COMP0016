These polymerases can efficiently synthesize and reverse-transcribe a number of xenonucleic acids (XNAs) that differ significantly from the canonical B-form of DNA. We present here a protocol for hexitol nucleic acid (HNA) synthesis by an engineered Thermococcus gorgonarius polymerase variant, including adaptation for large-scale synthesis and purification, and for other XNAs. We describe XNA purification and reverse transcription (with a previously reported XNA RT also based on Thermococcus gorgonarius), as well as key considerations for the characterization and optimization of XNA reactions. \u00a9 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["thermostable DNA polymerases", "XNA reverse transcription", "XNA synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA", "DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Protein Engineering", "Reverse Transcription", "Temperature", "Thermococcus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057232499", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"36552147400": {"Name": "Cozens C.", "AuthorID": "36552147400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "12774570400": {"Name": "Pinheiro V.", "AuthorID": "12774570400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}}}
