They conclude that the \u201cyes/no\u201d format is preferable as it reflects deeper processing of survey questions. Smyth et al. (2008) found that the \u201cyes/no\u201d format performed similarly across telephone and web modes. In this paper we replicate their research and extend it by including a comparison with face-toface in addition to telephone and web and by using probability samples of the general adult population. A cognitive interviewing follow-up was used to explore the quantitative findings. Our results suggest there are times when the \u201cyes/no\u201d format may not perform similarly across modes and that there may be factors which limit the quality of answers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Check all that apply", "Forced choice", "Mode of data collection", "Questionnaire design", "Survey methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949435527", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"6508388306": {"Name": "Nicolaas G.", "AuthorID": "6508388306", "AffiliationID": "60103001", "AffiliationName": "Ipsos MORI"}, "6603786397": {"Name": "Campanelli P.", "AuthorID": "6603786397", "AffiliationID": "114349658", "AffiliationName": "The Survey Coach"}, "7005279868": {"Name": "Hope S.", "AuthorID": "7005279868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "14622477400": {"Name": "J\u00e4ckle A.", "AuthorID": "14622477400", "AffiliationID": "60102147", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}, "7006455558": {"Name": "Lynn P.", "AuthorID": "7006455558", "AffiliationID": "60102147", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}}}
