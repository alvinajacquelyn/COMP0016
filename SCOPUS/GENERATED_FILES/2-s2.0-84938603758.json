Here, reductive dissolution has been simplified to a single one-pot reaction through the use of sodium naphthalide in dimethylacetamide allowing direct synthesis of SWCNT Na<sup>+</sup> solutions. Gram quantities of SWCNTs can be dissolved at concentrations over 2 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>. These reduced SWCNT solutions can easily be functionalised through the addition of alkyl halides; reducing steric bulk of the grafting moiety and increasing polarisability of the leaving group increases the extent of functionalisation. An optimised absolute sodium concentration of 25 mM is shown to be more important than carbon to metal ratio in determining the maximum degree of functionalisation. This novel dissolution system can be modified for use as a non-destructive purification route for raw SWCNT powder by adjusting the degree of charging to dissolve carbonaceous impurities, catalyst particles and defective material, before processing the remaining SWCNTs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbonaceous impurities", "Catalyst particles", "Dimethylacetamide", "Dissolution systems", "Functionalisation", "Reductive dissolution", "Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs)", "Sodium naphthalide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938603758", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56330351900": {"Name": "Clancy A.J.", "AuthorID": "56330351900", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56380198800": {"Name": "Melbourne J.", "AuthorID": "56380198800", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}}}
