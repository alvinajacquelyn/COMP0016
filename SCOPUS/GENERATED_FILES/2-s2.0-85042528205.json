However, Kato-Katz misses many active infections, especially of light intensity. Point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) is an alternative field diagnostic that is more sensitive than Kato-Katz when intensity is low, but interpretation of CCA-trace results is unclear. To evaluate trace results, we tested urine and stool specimens from 398 pupils from eight schools in Burundi using four approaches: two in Burundi and two in a laboratory in Leiden, the Netherlands. In Burundi, we used Kato-Katz and point-of-care CCA (CCAB). In Leiden, we repeated the CCA (CCAL) and also used Up-Converting Phosphor Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA). Methods: We applied Bayesian latent class analyses (LCA), first considering CCA traces as negative and then as positive. We used the LCA output to estimate validity of the prevalence estimates of each test in comparison to the population-level infection prevalence and estimated the proportion of trace results that were likely true positives. Results: Kato-Katz yielded the lowest prevalence (6.8%), and CCAB with trace considered positive yielded the highest (53.5%). There were many more trace results recorded by CCA in Burundi (32.4%) than in Leiden (2.3%). Estimated prevalence with CAA was 46.5%. LCA indicated that Kato-Katz had the lowest sensitivity: 15.9% [Bayesian Credible Interval (BCI): 9.2-23.5%] with CCA-trace considered negative and 15.0% with trace as positive (BCI: 9.6-21.4%), implying that Kato-Katz missed approximately 85% of infections. CCAB underestimated disease prevalence when trace was considered negative and overestimated disease prevalence when trace was considered positive, by approximately 12 percentage points each way, and CAA overestimated prevalence in both models. Our results suggest that approximately 52.2% (BCI: 37.8-5.8%) of the CCAB trace readings were true infections. Conclusions: Whether measured in the laboratory or the field, CCA outperformed Kato-Katz at the low infection intensities in Burundi. CCA with trace as negative likely missed many infections, whereas CCA with trace as positive overestimated prevalence. In the absence of a field-friendly gold standard diagnostic, the use of a variety of diagnostics with differing properties will become increasingly important as programs move towards elimination of schistosomiasis. It is clear that CCA is a valuable tool for the detection and mapping of S. mansoni infection in the field and CAA may be a valuable field tool in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAA", "CCA", "Diagnostics", "Kato-Katz", "Latent class analysis", "Schistosomiasis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, Helminth", "Bayes Theorem", "Burundi", "Child", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Feces", "Female", "Glycoproteins", "Helminth Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Prevalence", "Schistosoma mansoni", "Schistosomiasis mansoni", "Schools", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042528205", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191919450": {"Name": "Clements M.", "AuthorID": "57191919450", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "7004545601": {"Name": "Fenwick A.", "AuthorID": "7004545601", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "56574703400": {"Name": "Harrison W.", "AuthorID": "56574703400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "36840156900": {"Name": "Ortu G.", "AuthorID": "36840156900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "36519097100": {"Name": "Lamine M.", "AuthorID": "36519097100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "57193795493": {"Name": "Zivieri A.", "AuthorID": "57193795493", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "6603447724": {"Name": "Corstjens P.", "AuthorID": "6603447724", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "25629689100": {"Name": "De Dood C.", "AuthorID": "25629689100", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6602679231": {"Name": "Kornelis D.", "AuthorID": "6602679231", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7005713255": {"Name": "Van Dam G.", "AuthorID": "7005713255", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57196589520": {"Name": "Binder S.", "AuthorID": "57196589520", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "57210925939": {"Name": "Campbell C.", "AuthorID": "57210925939", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "7102634065": {"Name": "Colley D.", "AuthorID": "7102634065", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "57193793354": {"Name": "Kayugi D.", "AuthorID": "57193793354", "AffiliationID": "114437172", "AffiliationName": "Programme National Integre de Lutte Contre les Maladies Tropicales Negligees et la Cecite, Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique et de la Lutte Contre le SIDA"}, "30967620000": {"Name": "Ndayishimiye O.", "AuthorID": "30967620000", "AffiliationID": "114437172", "AffiliationName": "Programme National Integre de Lutte Contre les Maladies Tropicales Negligees et la Cecite, Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique et de la Lutte Contre le SIDA"}, "7401525576": {"Name": "King C.", "AuthorID": "7401525576", "AffiliationID": "60006404", "AffiliationName": "Center for Global Health and Diseases, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"}}}
