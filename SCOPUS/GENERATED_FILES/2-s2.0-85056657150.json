Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet, how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using various bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, in which the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across various different probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian process function learning\u2014combined with an optimistic upper confidence bound sampling strategy\u2014provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Decision Making", "Exploratory Behavior", "Female", "Generalization (Psychology)", "Humans", "Male", "Reward", "Spatial Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056657150", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57193671926": {"Name": "Wu C.M.", "AuthorID": "57193671926", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "24765094800": {"Name": "Meder B.", "AuthorID": "24765094800", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "MPRG iSearch, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "7202482374": {"Name": "Schulz E.", "AuthorID": "7202482374", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}, "23470488800": {"Name": "Speekenbrink M.", "AuthorID": "23470488800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "55169673400": {"Name": "Nelson J.D.", "AuthorID": "55169673400", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "MPRG iSearch, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}}}
