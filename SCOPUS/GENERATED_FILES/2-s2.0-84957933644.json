Non-linear elastic wave acoustic spectroscopy (NEWS) methods have shown potential to detect early-stage flaws in metals and composites. The objectives of the ESA study reported here were to review the state of the art, then to design and build a breadboard demonstrator \u201cNEWS Imaging\u201d (NEWSI) non-linear acoustics instrument, and finally to demonstrate its capability using well-characterised reference defect artefacts (RDAs). A multi-mode NEWSI instrument was produced with the following modes of operation: (a) single and dual frequency, (b) pulse inversion, and (c) resonance drift modes. The first two are suitable for C-scan style imaging by contact testing or with the NACE (air-coupled detection) mode. A set of RDAs were sourced or manufactured, the most important of which was the development of successful kissing de-bonds; areas of significantly reduced bond strength, created in the bond-line between the composite laminates. All the RDAs were characterised by a wide range of complementary NDI methods, and the best results in terms of detection of all the known flaws was the scanning acoustic microscopy ultrasonic C-scan method. This technique detected all of the RDA defects except for kissing de-bonds. The NEWSI instrument was shown to be capable of detecting, with a certain degree of repeatability under controlled conditions, early-stage defects (kissing de-bonds) in composite materials. No other NDI method is known to detect these defect types. The results so far are encouraging and have potentially a lot of interest for ESA and the wider industry, if the unique capabilities of the NEWSI instrument demonstrated on the kissing de-bonds could be developed into a \u201croutine practical test instrument\u201d. The target of the next stage of work is to bring the technology readiness level of the instrument up to pre-production levels of development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Composite kissing de-bond defects", "Early-stage defect detection", "Non-destructive inspection", "Non-destructive testing", "Non-linear acoustic spectroscopy", "Space craft testing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957933644", "SubjectAreas": [["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"12139522100": {"Name": "Robinson D.W.", "AuthorID": "12139522100", "AffiliationID": "60029956", "AffiliationName": "Psi-tran Ltd"}, "7601523471": {"Name": "Wright J.", "AuthorID": "7601523471", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Theta Technologies Ltd, The Innovation Centre, University of Exeter"}, "57112910400": {"Name": "Gupta S.", "AuthorID": "57112910400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Theta Technologies Ltd, The Innovation Centre, University of Exeter"}, "56330652300": {"Name": "Mottram T.", "AuthorID": "56330652300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Theta Technologies Ltd, The Innovation Centre, University of Exeter"}, "7103166218": {"Name": "Armitage P.", "AuthorID": "7103166218", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Theta Technologies Ltd, The Innovation Centre, University of Exeter"}, "24331427400": {"Name": "Gower M.", "AuthorID": "24331427400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "6507035384": {"Name": "Lodeiro M.", "AuthorID": "6507035384", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "6505814954": {"Name": "Gelat P.", "AuthorID": "6505814954", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "57215030592": {"Name": "Schwarz C.", "AuthorID": "57215030592", "AffiliationID": "60031159", "AffiliationName": "ESA-ESTEC"}}}
