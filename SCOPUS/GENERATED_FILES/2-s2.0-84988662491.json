In particular, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that combine a coarse grained description of the lipid bilayer with state of art analytical models for multivalent ligand-receptor interactions. Using density of state calculations, we derive the partition function in pairs of vesicles and compute the number of ligand-receptor bonds as a function of temperature. Numerical results are compared to microscopy and fluorimetry experiments on large unilamellar vesicles decorated by DNA linkers carrying complementary overhangs. We find that vesicle aggregation is suppressed when the total number of linkers falls below a threshold value. Within the model proposed here, this is due to the higher configurational costs required to form inter-vesicle bridges as compared to intra-vesicle loops, which are in turn related to membrane deformability. Our findings and our numerical/experimental methodologies are applicable to the rational design of liposomes used as functional materials and drug delivery applications, as well as to study inter-membrane interactions in living systems, such as cell adhesion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coarse-grained description", "Drug delivery applications", "Experimental platform", "Large unilamellar vesicles", "Ligand-receptor complex", "Lipid-bilayer vesicles", "Membrane interactions", "Partition functions", "DNA", "Lipid Bilayers", "Monte Carlo Method", "Transition Temperature", "Unilamellar Liposomes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988662491", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189358987": {"Name": "Bachmann S.J.", "AuthorID": "57189358987", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Department of Physics, Interdisciplinary Center for Nonlinear Phenomena and Complex Systems, Service de Physique des Syst\u00e8mes Complexes M\u00e9canique Statistique, Campus Plaine"}, "6602388721": {"Name": "Mognetti B.M.", "AuthorID": "6602388721", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Department of Physics, Interdisciplinary Center for Nonlinear Phenomena and Complex Systems, Service de Physique des Syst\u00e8mes Complexes M\u00e9canique Statistique, Campus Plaine"}, "12804936400": {"Name": "Kotar J.", "AuthorID": "12804936400", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Biological and Soft Systems, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "56610371200": {"Name": "Parolini L.", "AuthorID": "56610371200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Biological and Soft Systems, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57216243331": {"Name": "Cicuta P.", "AuthorID": "57216243331", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Biological and Soft Systems, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "36717264800": {"Name": "Di Michele L.", "AuthorID": "36717264800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Biological and Soft Systems, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "23669259400": {"Name": "\u0160ari\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "23669259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
