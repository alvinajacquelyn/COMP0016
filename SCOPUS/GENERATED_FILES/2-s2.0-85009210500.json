We examined the association of fat mass with bone mass in a lean population. Objective: To investigate association between hip bone mineral density and fat and lean mass in a cross-sectional study from southern India. Design: The Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study is a prospective cohort study in Hyderabad, India. In 2009-2012, the study collected data on anthropometric measures, bone mineral density (BMD), fat mass, and lean mass measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and socioeconomic data of the adult participants (n = 1760; mean age = 34.9 years old for women; 2130 and 32.3 for men). Results: The median BMI (kg/m2) was 20.1 kg/m2. Women had relatively higher fat mass as compared to men. In models adjusted for lean mass, there was an association between hip bone mineral density and fat mass in women (\u03b2 (95% confidence interval): premenopausal 0.025 (0.006 to 0.045); postmenopausal 0.045 (0.014 to 0.076)) but not in men (0.001 (-0.012 to 0.0014)). The association between hip BMD and fat mass was stronger in postmenopausal than premenopausal women. Hip BMD was consistently associated with lean mass, in both men and women. Conclusions: In this relatively lean population, lean mass was more consistently associated with hip BMD than fat mass. Weight gain through lean mass improvement may be a more reliable public health strategy for strengthening bone health in transitional settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Composition", "Bone Density", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "India", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteoporosis", "Pelvic Bones", "Public Health Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Rural Population", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009210500", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56185266200": {"Name": "Matsuzaki M.", "AuthorID": "56185266200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6603836017": {"Name": "Kinra S.", "AuthorID": "6603836017", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35330168900": {"Name": "Kulkarni B.", "AuthorID": "35330168900", "AffiliationID": "60017656, 60025666", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Council of Medical Research"}, "7003438333": {"Name": "Radhakrishna K.V.", "AuthorID": "7003438333", "AffiliationID": "60017656, 60025666", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Council of Medical Research"}, "7004023998": {"Name": "Kuper H.", "AuthorID": "7004023998", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.B.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health and Statistics Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "23020033800": {"Name": "Prabhakaran P.", "AuthorID": "23020033800", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India"}, "35365369500": {"Name": "Walia G.K.", "AuthorID": "35365369500", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India"}, "36338307500": {"Name": "Aggarwal A.", "AuthorID": "36338307500", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India"}, "57199940722": {"Name": "Gupta V.", "AuthorID": "57199940722", "AffiliationID": "60029284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Delhi"}, "7004283783": {"Name": "Prabhakaran D.", "AuthorID": "7004283783", "AffiliationID": "114690694", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Disease Control"}, "35354080500": {"Name": "Smith G.D.", "AuthorID": "35354080500", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), University of Bristol, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7006649063": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "7006649063", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), University of Bristol, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
