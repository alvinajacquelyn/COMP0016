We have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate their structures and stabilities in aqueous solution. We find the calcium to be seven-coordinated by two water molecules, two bidentate phosphates, and one monodentate phosphate. Free energy results obtained using umbrella sampling simulations show that the complex with a Ca/P ratio of 1:3 is the most energetically favored and more thermodynamically stable than the free ions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation", "Inorganic components", "Monodentates", "Pre-nucleation", "Thermodynamically stable", "Triphosphate", "Umbrella sampling", "Water molecule"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973316184", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189593674": {"Name": "Mancardi G.", "AuthorID": "57189593674", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36010172100": {"Name": "Terranova U.", "AuthorID": "36010172100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "De Leeuw N.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}}}
