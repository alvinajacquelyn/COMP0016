The dynamic evolution of systems composed of both dynamic and random fluctuations can be studied with stochastic dynamic models (SDMs). This article, Part II of a two-part series, reviews applications of SDMs to large-scale neural systems in health and disease. Stochastic models have already elucidated a number of pathophysiological phenomena, such as epilepsy and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, although their use in biological psychiatry remains rather nascent. Emerging research in this field includes phenomenological models of mood fluctuations in bipolar disorder and biophysical models of functional imaging data in psychotic and affective disorders. Together with deeper theoretical considerations, this work suggests that SDMs will play a unique and influential role in computational psychiatry, unifying empirical observations with models of perception and behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational neuroscience", "Computational psychiatry", "Epilepsy", "Mathematical modeling", "Melancholia", "Stochastic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Stochastic Processes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016817791", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57189219407": {"Name": "Roberts J.A.", "AuthorID": "57189219407", "AffiliationID": "60028435, 60025029", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Brain Function, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital"}, "6603702151": {"Name": "Breakspear M.", "AuthorID": "6603702151", "AffiliationID": "60028435", "AffiliationName": "Metro North Mental Health Service, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
