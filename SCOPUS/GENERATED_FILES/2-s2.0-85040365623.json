We study the injection of one fluid into a planar two-dimensional porous medium containing another, more viscous fluid. We find that the dynamics are distinguished by three regimes: An early-time linearly unstable regime, an intermediate-time nonlinear regime and a late-time single-finger exchange-flow regime. In the first regime, the flow can be linearly unstable to perturbations that grow exponentially. We identify, using linear stability theory and numerical simulations, a critical P\u00e9clet number below which the flow remains stable for all times. In the second regime, the flow is dominated by the nonlinear coalescence of fingers which form a mixing zone in which we observe that the convective mixing rate, characterized by a convective Nusselt number, exhibits power-law growth. In this second regime we derive a model for the transversely averaged concentration which shows good agreement with our numerical experiments and extends previous empirical models. Finally, we identify a new final exchange-flow regime in which a pair of counter-propagating diffusive fingers slow exponentially. We derive an analytic solution for this single-finger state which agrees well with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that the flow always evolves to this regime, irrespective of the viscosity ratio and P\u00e9clet number, in contrast to previous suggestions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["low-Reynolds-number flows", "porous media"], "IndexKeywords": ["Convective mixing", "Counterpropagating", "High-resolution numerical simulation", "Linear stability theory", "Low Reynolds number flow", "Non-linear regimes", "Numerical experiments", "Viscous fingering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040365623", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57144647700": {"Name": "Nijjer J.", "AuthorID": "57144647700", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "55240280900": {"Name": "Hewitt D.", "AuthorID": "55240280900", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "25029656800": {"Name": "Neufeld J.", "AuthorID": "25029656800", "AffiliationID": "60008160, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "BP Institute, University of Cambridge, Bullard Laboratories"}}}
