Here, we show that, in cortical neurons, a subset of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) located in the proximity of activity-regulated genes bears features of enhancers. Enhancer SINEs (eSINEs) recruit the Pol III cofactor complex TFIIIC in a stimulus-dependent manner and are transcribed by Pol III in response to neuronal depolarization. Characterization of an eSINE located in proximity to the Fos gene (FosRSINE1) indicated that the FosRSINE1-encoded transcript interacts with Pol II at the Fos promoter and mediates Fos relocation to Pol II factories, providing an unprecedented molecular link between Pol III and Pol II transcription. Strikingly, knockdown of the FosRSINE1 transcript induces defects of both cortical radial migration in vivo and activity-dependent dendritogenesis in vitro, demonstrating that FosRSINE1 acts as a strong enhancer of Fos expression in diverse physiological contexts. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression requires the interaction between promoters and distally located enhancers. Policarpi et al. identify a subset of SINEs that functions as enhancers for activity-dependent neuronal genes. The enhancer SINE FosRSINE1 regulates Fos transcription and is necessary for both activity-dependent dendritogenesis and proper brain development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enhancers", "epigenetics", "neuronal activity", "neuronal development", "neuroscience", "SINEs", "transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Mice", "Neurons", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid", "RNA Polymerase II", "RNA Polymerase III", "Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements", "Transcription Factors, TFIII", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038101131", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55864450500": {"Name": "Policarpi C.", "AuthorID": "55864450500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6701570866": {"Name": "Crepaldi L.", "AuthorID": "6701570866", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Genome Campus Hinxton, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "23026911800": {"Name": "Brookes E.", "AuthorID": "23026911800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "37005770700": {"Name": "Nitarska J.", "AuthorID": "37005770700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57200977053": {"Name": "French S.", "AuthorID": "57200977053", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "54584946300": {"Name": "Coatti A.", "AuthorID": "54584946300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "56961680500": {"Name": "Riccio A.", "AuthorID": "56961680500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
