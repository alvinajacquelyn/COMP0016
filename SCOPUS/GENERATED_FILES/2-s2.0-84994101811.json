In this paper we report on the progress and impacts of a programme in Central Java to develop the capacity for joint action in industry clusters via economic forums in local government jurisdictions. We focus on the emerging relationships between industry clusters and their respective economic forums in four local government jurisdictions. Despite progress, the findings reveal the difficulties of developing new institutions to support joint action. These difficulties follow from the limits presented by the private sector dynamics underlying industry clusters and from variations in local government organisation, resourcing and understandings of the remit of these new institutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["external economies", "Indonesia", "industry clusters", "joint action", "local economic forums"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994101811", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"57203076068": {"Name": "Phelps N.A.", "AuthorID": "57203076068", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Regional Development, University College London, Bartlett School of Planning"}, "57191838203": {"Name": "Wijaya H.B.", "AuthorID": "57191838203", "AffiliationID": "60069385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Diponegoro University"}}}
