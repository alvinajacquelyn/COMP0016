Few previous studies have reported quality of life (QoL) and social validity outcomes. Method: The present authors collected data on 85 people referred to a specialist PBS team. The present authors used a unique set of multiple measures and statistical change metrics to evaluate outcome. Results: Statistically significant improvements in QoL and health-related QoL (HRQoL), with medium to large effect sizes, were demonstrated following PBS input. Mean Behaviour Problems Inventory-Short Form scores reduced from 37.74 (SD = 30.54) at baseline to 12.12 (SD = 12.24) at follow-up, with a large effect size (d = 0.84). Stakeholders reported valuing the process and outcomes of PBS, findings which support the social validity of PBS for people with developmental disabilities. Conclusion: This study demonstrates successful PBS outcomes in QoL, HRQoL, challenging behaviour and social validity in a community setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BPI-S", "challenging behaviour", "intellectual disability", "positive behavioural support", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Community Mental Health Services", "Developmental Disabilities", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Problem Behavior", "Quality of Life", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070950205", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57192375528": {"Name": "Bowring D.L.", "AuthorID": "57192375528", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "CEDAR, University of Warwick"}, "7102719472": {"Name": "Hastings R.P.", "AuthorID": "7102719472", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Psychiatry and Psychology, Monash University"}, "12760208200": {"Name": "Totsika V.", "AuthorID": "12760208200", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Psychiatry and Psychology, Monash University"}, "24823598400": {"Name": "Toogood S.", "AuthorID": "24823598400", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Bangor University"}}}
