Tamoxifen is also an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a GPCR ubiquitously expressed in tissues that mediates the acute response to estrogens. Here we report that tamoxifen promotes mechanical quiescence in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), stromal fibroblast-like cells whose activation triggers and perpetuates liver fibrosis in hepatocellular carcinomas. This mechanical deactivation is mediated by the GPER/RhoA/myosin axis and induces YAP deactivation. We report that tamoxifen decreases the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins through a mechanical mechanism that involves actomyosin-dependent contractility and mechanosensing of tissue stiffness. Our results implicate GPER-mediated estrogen signalling in the mechanosensory-driven activation of HSCs and put forward estrogenic signalling as an option for mechanical reprogramming of myofibroblast-like cells in the tumour microenvironment. Tamoxifen, with half a century of safe clinical use, might lead this strategy of drug repositioning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line", "Estrogens", "Fibroblasts", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Signal Transduction", "Tamoxifen", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059099290", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57190090388": {"Name": "Cortes E.", "AuthorID": "57190090388", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57191091618": {"Name": "Lachowski D.", "AuthorID": "57191091618", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57190214550": {"Name": "Rice A.", "AuthorID": "57190214550", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57190216827": {"Name": "Robinson B.", "AuthorID": "57190216827", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57205082924": {"Name": "Yeldag G.", "AuthorID": "57205082924", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57189524365": {"Name": "del R\u00edo Hern\u00e1ndez A.E.", "AuthorID": "57189524365", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "25636557000": {"Name": "Thorpe S.D.", "AuthorID": "25636557000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Material Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36071667600": {"Name": "Lee D.A.", "AuthorID": "36071667600", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Material Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23097829000": {"Name": "Ghemtio L.", "AuthorID": "23097829000", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Drug Research Program, Division of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki"}, "6603058561": {"Name": "Rombouts K.", "AuthorID": "6603058561", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine and Fibrosis Group, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
