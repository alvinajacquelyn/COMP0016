This chapter presents an overview of selected issues related to the epidemiology and burden of neurological illness. It emphasises studies from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and the UCL Institute of Neurology. Although the study of the epidemiology of disease provides figures on incidence, prevalence, risk factors and distribution within a population, such information is of limited practical value in terms of population health unless linked to a treatment (or prevention) programme and resource utilisation. The burden of illness on individuals and on carers are not comprehensively accounted for in studies which focus on broad categories biased towards societal and economic considerations. A Global Campaign survey found that epilepsy treatment gap could be reduced by about 20% with relatively simple measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burden of illness", "Epilepsy", "Epilepsy treatment gap", "Global Campaign survey", "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery", "Neurological disease", "Transient ischaemia", "UCL Institute of Neurology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024850206", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7101797716": {"Name": "Shorvon S.", "AuthorID": "7101797716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}}}
