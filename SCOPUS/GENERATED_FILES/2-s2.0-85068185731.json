Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) are rapid and sensitive approaches that can be used to pinpoint defects in viral DNA replication and transcriptional activity, respectively. Due to the significant nucleotide overlap between Poxviridae these methods can be employed across a wide range of viruses from this family. Here we provide methods for the quantification of vaccinia DNA replication by qPCR and quantification of the three classes of vaccinia gene transcription by qRT-PCR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Quantitative PCR (qPCR)", "Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)", "Vaccinia DNA replication", "Vaccinia gene expression"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA, Viral", "Genome, Viral", "Humans", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Viral", "Vaccinia virus", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068185731", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55841162600": {"Name": "Huttunen M.", "AuthorID": "55841162600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC-Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "14121881600": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "14121881600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC-Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
