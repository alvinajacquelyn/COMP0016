Organic fluorophores may help here as they can yield more photons\u2014by orders of magnitude\u2014than fluorescent proteins. To achieve molecular specificity with organic fluorophores in live cells, self-labeling proteins are often used, with HaloTags and SNAP-tags being the most common. However, how these two different tagging systems compare with each other is unclear, especially for stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, which is limited to a small repertoire of fluorophores in living cells. Herein, we compare the two labeling approaches in confocal and STED imaging using various proteins and two model systems. Strikingly, we find that the fluorescent signal can be up to 9-fold higher with HaloTags than with SNAP-tags when using far-red rhodamine derivatives. This result demonstrates that the labeling strategy matters and can greatly influence the duration of super-resolution imaging.\u00a9 2019 Elsevier LtdSelf-labeling proteins leverage the superior photophysical properties of organic fluorophores and are the method of choice for live-cell nanoscopy. Comparing SNAP-tags and HaloTags, Erdmann et al. show that Halo tagging with silicon rhodamine fluorophores provides brighter labeling for confocal and STED nanoscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fluorophores", "HaloTag", "live-cell imaging", "microscopy", "nanoscopy", "self-labeling proteins", "SNAP-tag", "STED", "super-resolution microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drosophila", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Proteins", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Rhodamines", "Staining and Labeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064153309", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57213320335": {"Name": "Erdmann R.", "AuthorID": "57213320335", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Yale University"}, "48461019300": {"Name": "Baguley S.", "AuthorID": "48461019300", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "55180007700": {"Name": "Xi Z.", "AuthorID": "55180007700", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "56205809900": {"Name": "Zhong S.", "AuthorID": "56205809900", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "6506277447": {"Name": "Bewersdorf J.", "AuthorID": "6506277447", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University"}, "7103209478": {"Name": "Rothman J.", "AuthorID": "7103209478", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "6602451497": {"Name": "Toomre D.", "AuthorID": "6602451497", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "54891666400": {"Name": "Wissner R.", "AuthorID": "54891666400", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Yale University"}, "57199262053": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "57199262053", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Yale University"}, "7006909921": {"Name": "Schepartz A.", "AuthorID": "7006909921", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Yale University"}, "35488904900": {"Name": "Richens J.", "AuthorID": "35488904900", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "35298555300": {"Name": "Allgeyer E.", "AuthorID": "35298555300", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "36928240900": {"Name": "Lowe N.", "AuthorID": "36928240900", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "57208229285": {"Name": "Butler R.", "AuthorID": "57208229285", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "57197184145": {"Name": "St Johnston D.", "AuthorID": "57197184145", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}}}
