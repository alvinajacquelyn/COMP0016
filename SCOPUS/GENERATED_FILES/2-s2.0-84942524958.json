This process, which we term adaptive cellular reprogramming, promotes regeneration in one of two ways: by providing a transient class of repair cells or by directly replacing cells lost during tissue damage. Controlling adaptive changes in cell fate in vivo in order to promote the body's own cell therapy, particularly by pharmacology rather than genetics, is likely to become an increasingly active area of future work.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Plasticity", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Humans", "Regeneration", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942524958", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7101820405": {"Name": "Jessen K.", "AuthorID": "7101820405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "8707856500": {"Name": "Mirsky R.", "AuthorID": "8707856500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "14622301100": {"Name": "Arthur-Farraj P.", "AuthorID": "14622301100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
