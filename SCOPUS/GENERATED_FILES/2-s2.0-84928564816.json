This includes transfer of antibiotic resistance and other factors that allow the organism to survive challenging environments, modulation of toxin gene expression, transfer of the toxin genes themselves and the conversion of non-toxigenic strains to toxin producers. Mobile genetic elements have also been adapted by investigators to probe the biology of the organism and the various ways in which these have been used are reviewed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteriophage", "Conjugative transposon", "Horizontal gene transfer", "PaLoc", "Tn5397", "Tn916"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Biological", "Bacterial Toxins", "Clostridium difficile", "Gene Transfer, Horizontal", "Genome, Bacterial", "Interspersed Repetitive Sequences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928564816", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"7003643625": {"Name": "Mullany P.", "AuthorID": "7003643625", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "55464768800": {"Name": "Roberts A.", "AuthorID": "55464768800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
