Despite this, the self-report AQS is still widely used, with researchers arguing that providing additional training can improve its validity. The aim of this study was to update the 2004 meta-analysis. Two hundred forty-five studies from 1987 to 2016 were included (n = 32,426). Separate meta-analyses were conducted to examine validity and reliability. The observer AQS showed moderate convergent validity with the Strange Situation Procedure (r =.25; r =.39 for long observation periods) and good predictive validity in terms of associations with sensitivity (r =.32). It showed a relatively weak association with infant temperament (r =.21), suggesting some discriminant validity. The self-report version showed comparable convergent validity with Strange Situation Procedure (r =.18), but significantly weaker correlations with sensitivity (r =.25) and stronger correlations with temperament (r =.33). There was no evidence that providing additional training improved the validity of the self-report version. This study corroborates the previous finding that the observer AQS is a valid measure of infant attachment, especially after long periods of observation. The self-report version showed significantly weaker discriminant and predictive validity. Highlights: The aim of the study was to update the 2004 meta-analysis assessing the validity of the attachment Q-Sort (AQS). This study broadly replicated the findings of the previous meta-analysis, showing that the observer AQS is a valid measure of attachment. Caution should be shown in using the self-report AQS due to its comparatively weaker predictive and discriminate validity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AQS", "attachment", "attachment Q-set", "attachment Q-sort", "meta-analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019863969", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57208491461": {"Name": "Cadman T.", "AuthorID": "57208491461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57194396985": {"Name": "Diamond P.R.", "AuthorID": "57194396985", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neuroepidemiology and Ageing Research Unit, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}}}
