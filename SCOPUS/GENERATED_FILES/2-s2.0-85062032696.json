The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data (median rms noise of 71 Jy at 150 MHz) over 424 square degrees of sky, which is sucient to detect 10 615 (32 per cent) of the SDSS galaxies over this sky area. An improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately from sources with radio emission powered by star formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a sample of 2121 local (z 0:3) radio AGN. The local 150MHz luminosity function is derived for radio AGN and SF galaxies separately, and the good agreement with previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests that the separation method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and black hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive galaxies (1011 M) displaying radio-AGN activity with L150MHz 1021WHz 1; thus, the most massive galaxies are always switched on at some level. The results allow the full Eddington-scaled accretion rate distribution (a proxy for the duty cyc e) to be probed for massive galaxies, and this accretion rate is found to peak at Lmech=LEdd 10 5. More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the 2 per cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates, Lmech=LEdd 10 2:5. Stellar mass is shown to be a more important driver of radio-AGN activity than black hole mass, suggesting a possible connection between the fuelling gas and the surrounding halo. This result is in line with models in which these radio AGN are essential for maintaining the quenched state of galaxiesat the centres of hot gas haloes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: active", "Galaxies: evolution", "Radio continuum: galaxies", "Surveys"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active galactic nuclei", "Galaxies : active", "Galaxies: evolutions", "Luminosity functions", "Radio continuum: galaxies", "Separation methods", "Sloan Digital Sky Survey", "Strong dependences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062032696", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55138990800": {"Name": "Sabater J.", "AuthorID": "55138990800", "AffiliationID": "60006858, 60110880", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, Institute for Astronomy, Royal Observatory"}, "7102838056": {"Name": "Best P.N.", "AuthorID": "7102838056", "AffiliationID": "60006858, 60110880", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, Institute for Astronomy, Royal Observatory"}, "6603918974": {"Name": "Br\u00fcggen M.", "AuthorID": "6603918974", "AffiliationID": "60006858, 60110880", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, Institute for Astronomy, Royal Observatory"}, "55942518400": {"Name": "Hardcastle M.J.", "AuthorID": "55942518400", "AffiliationID": "60025529", "AffiliationName": "ASTRON, Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy"}, "56635492800": {"Name": "Tasse C.", "AuthorID": "56635492800", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "7005938930": {"Name": "R\u00f6ttgering H.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005938930", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "57202241376": {"Name": "Smith D.J.B.", "AuthorID": "57202241376", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "55195417400": {"Name": "Harwood J.J.", "AuthorID": "55195417400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "25923982800": {"Name": "Shimwell T.W.", "AuthorID": "25923982800", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Electronics, Rhodes University"}, "55532159100": {"Name": "Williams W.L.", "AuthorID": "55532159100", "AffiliationID": "60028229", "AffiliationName": "University of Hamburg, Hamburger Sternwarte"}, "6602670370": {"Name": "Croston J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602670370", "AffiliationID": "60028229", "AffiliationName": "University of Hamburg, Hamburger Sternwarte"}, "56644232800": {"Name": "Cochrane R.K.", "AuthorID": "56644232800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "37097564600": {"Name": "Mingo B.", "AuthorID": "37097564600", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "37096914100": {"Name": "De Gasperin F.", "AuthorID": "37096914100", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "56025072300": {"Name": "G\u00fcrkan G.", "AuthorID": "56025072300", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "55887427800": {"Name": "Prandoni I.", "AuthorID": "55887427800", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "57201527103": {"Name": "Saxena A.", "AuthorID": "57201527103", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "7103103079": {"Name": "Duncan K.J.", "AuthorID": "7103103079", "AffiliationID": "114696542", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science"}, "57193312703": {"Name": "Mechev A.P.", "AuthorID": "57193312703", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics, University of Oxford"}, "48561488800": {"Name": "Morabito L.K.", "AuthorID": "48561488800", "AffiliationID": "60012681", "AffiliationName": "INAF - Istituto di Radioastronomia"}, "57206844949": {"Name": "Mooney S.", "AuthorID": "57206844949", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University College Dublin"}}}
