We show that this assignment extends, under appropriate finiteness conditions, to a functor H : Aff \u2192Algbimod(DGCat), where the latter denotes the category of monoidal DG categories and bimodules. Any functor A : Aff \u2192 Algbimod(DGCat) gives rise, by taking modules, to a theory of sheaves of categories ShvCatA. In this paper, we study ShvCatH. Loosely speaking, this theory categorifies the theory of D-modules, in the same way as Gaitsgory's original ShvCat categorifies the theory of quasi-coherent sheaves. We develop the functoriality of ShvCatA, its descent properties and the notion of H-affineness. We then prove the H-affineness of algebraic stacks: for Y a stack satisfying some mild conditions, the \u221e-category ShvCatA (Y) is equivalent to the \u221e-category of modules for H(Y), the monoidal DG category of higher differential operators. The main consequence, for Y quasi-smooth, is the following: if C is a DG category acted on by H(Y), then C admits a theory of singular support in Sing(Y), where Sing(Y) is the space of singularities of Y. As an application to the geometric Langlands programme, we indicate how derived Satake yields an action of H(LSG ) on D(BunG), thereby equipping objects of D(BunG) with singular support in Sing(LSG).", "AuthorKeywords": ["derived algebraic geometry", "derived Satake", "formal completions", "Hecke functors", "Hochschild cochains", "ind-coherent sheaves", "quasi-smooth stacks", "singular support"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068501532", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"]], "AuthorData": {"57196478760": {"Name": "Beraldo D.", "AuthorID": "57196478760", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60122685", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Toulouse, Universit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier"}}}
