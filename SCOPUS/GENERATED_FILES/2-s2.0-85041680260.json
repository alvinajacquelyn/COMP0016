This study evaluated the use of fluorescent dyes (Bis-ANS, SYPRO Orange, Thioflavin T and ProteoStat) to characterise mAb aggregates in Chinese hamster ovary clarified cultures. RESULTS: The null and mAb culture supernatants showed an increase in fluorescence intensity over the duration of the culture. The null cultures on day 14 saw a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity; day 10 to day 14, Bis-ANS and Thioflavin T had average increases of 21% and 48%, respectively, whereas ProteoStat and SYPRO Orange showed an average increase of 60%. Higher fluorescence intensity on day 14 with the null cultures, also correlated with loss of viability. CONCLUSION: Fluorescent dyes are not a specific indicator of mAb aggregation, but rather an indicator of overall protein aggregation or high molecular weight species. SYPRO Orange was more sensitive at detecting very large molecular weight species and ProteoStat seemed better suited to smaller aggregates. Although the assay cannot be used to measure mAb aggregates in cell culture, it could be used to aid cell line selection in maximising viabilities and minimising the amount of aggregates. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
