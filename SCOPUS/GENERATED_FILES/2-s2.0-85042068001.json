The pathological significance of the microbiome was assessed through its relationship with known urothelial inflammatory markers and patient reported symptoms. Methods: Adult female patients with OAB symptoms and asymptomatic controls were assessed at 12 study visits scheduled every 4 weeks. At each visit, all participants provided a clean-catch midstream urine (MSU) that was analysed to count white and uroepithelial cells, submitted to standard culture and spun urothelial-cell-sediment culture. Symptoms were assessed using validated questionnaires. Results: This analysis shows that OAB patients differ consistently from controls, demonstrating differences in bacterial ecology (t \u22124.57, p 0.0001), in the microscopic pyuria count (t \u22126.37, p 0.0001) and presence of infected urothelial cells (t \u22124.21, p 0.0001). The primary outcome measure of bacterial growth [colony-forming units (CFU) ml\u22121] was higher in OAB patients than in controls throughout the 12 months. Data showed a correlation between symptoms and pyuria, with notable urgency correlating with pyuria and epithelial cell shedding. The routine urine cultures (with a threshold of reporting a positive result as 105 CFU/ml) were unable to distinguish OAB patients from controls. However, sediment cultures differed significantly, and there was a correlated increased immune response amongst OAB patients. Conclusions: This study supports the need to re-examine the OAB phenotype given this association with microbial colonisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infection", "OAB", "UTI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Colony Count, Microbial", "Female", "Humans", "Microbiota", "Middle Aged", "Pyuria", "Single-Blind Method", "Urinalysis", "Urinary Bladder, Overactive", "Urothelium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042068001", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56611436400": {"Name": "Gill K.", "AuthorID": "56611436400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57200655420": {"Name": "Kang R.", "AuthorID": "57200655420", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55775002200": {"Name": "Sathiananthamoorthy S.", "AuthorID": "55775002200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7003536229": {"Name": "Malone-Lee J.", "AuthorID": "7003536229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "23392797800": {"Name": "Khasriya R.", "AuthorID": "23392797800", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Urogynecology, University College Hospital"}}}
