The aim of this research is to develop a new biomaterial system that provides a hemostatic effect on bone hemorrhage and does not interfere with native bone regeneration. The role of electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol)-gelatin in scaffolds is to provide the covering of the wound, while encapsulation and absorption of red blood cells are attributed to the biphasic calcium phosphate-pectin-gelatin hydrogel. Cell viability and cell proliferation were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Live/Dead assay, and immunofluorescence assay using pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. The effects with and without hemostatic bilayer scaffolds on rat calvaria were compared at 1 and 3-weeks. The hemostatic bilayer agent showed good blood absorption behavior and efficient bone healing properties after 3-weeks, as observed by micro-computed tomography and hematoxylin and eosin staining.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bilayer hemostatic scaffold", "biphasic calcium phosphate-pectin-gelatin", "bone hemorrhage application", "electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol)-gelatin", "hemostatic agent"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption behaviors", "Bi-layer", "Bilayer composites", "Biphasic calcium phosphates", "Gelatin hydrogels", "Hemostatic agents", "Immunofluorescence assay", "Microcomputed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931388161", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56266492200": {"Name": "Linh N.T.B.", "AuthorID": "56266492200", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "55846388000": {"Name": "Padalhin A.R.", "AuthorID": "55846388000", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Regenerative Medicine, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "7405436570": {"Name": "Lee B.T.", "AuthorID": "7405436570", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "57218130873": {"Name": "Lee B.Y.", "AuthorID": "57218130873", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "InoBone Corporate RandD Center, Soonchunhyang University"}}}
