This ongoing, open-label, long-term study (NCT02004704) assessed safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa following 30 months of treatment in five adult patients with ASMD. There were no deaths, serious or severe events, or discontinuations during 30 months of treatment. The majority of adverse events were mild and included headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. No patient developed anti-drug antibodies and there were no clinically significant adverse changes in vital signs, hematology, or cardiac safety parameters. Statistically significant reductions in liver (31%) and spleen (39%) volumes were maintained through 30 months of treatment. There was a mean increase in lung diffusing capacity of 35%, and clinically relevant improvements in infiltrative lung disease parameters. Lipid profiles improved in all patients. Improvements in bone mineral density of the spine were observed in some patients. Chitotriosidase in serum and lyso-sphingomyelin in dried blood spots decreased with olipudase alfa treatment, suggesting utility as biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy. Olipudase alfa is the first etiology-specific treatment in development for ASMD. This study demonstrates that treatment with olipudase alfa for 30 months is well-tolerated and associated with life-transforming sustained improvements in relevant disease clinical measures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Bone Density", "Enzyme Replacement Therapy", "Female", "Hexosaminidases", "Humans", "Lipids", "Liver", "Lung", "Male", "Niemann-Pick Disease, Type A", "Phosphorylcholine", "Recombinant Proteins", "Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase", "Sphingosine", "Spleen", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040030866", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6601974880": {"Name": "Wasserstein M.P.", "AuthorID": "6601974880", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7201671437": {"Name": "Diaz G.A.", "AuthorID": "7201671437", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7003596979": {"Name": "Lachmann R.H.", "AuthorID": "7003596979", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57200174001": {"Name": "Jouvin M.H.", "AuthorID": "57200174001", "AffiliationID": "60001413", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences and Operations, Sanofi Genzyme"}, "57200182227": {"Name": "Nandy I.", "AuthorID": "57200182227", "AffiliationID": "60001413", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences and Operations, Sanofi Genzyme"}, "8546760000": {"Name": "Ji A.J.", "AuthorID": "8546760000", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Biomarkers and Clinical Bioanalyses, Sanofi Genzyme"}, "56667136500": {"Name": "Puga A.C.", "AuthorID": "56667136500", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Development, Rare Diseases, Sanofi Genzyme"}}}
