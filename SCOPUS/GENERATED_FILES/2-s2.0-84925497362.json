However, the implantation currently requires an invasive surgical procedure. Endoscopy could be used to place the gastric stimulator in the stomach, hence avoiding the riskier surgery. The implant then needs to go through the oesophagus and be located inside the stomach, which imposes new design constraints, such as miniaturization and protecting the electronic circuit against the highly acidic environment of the stomach. We propose to protect the implant by encapsulation with silicone rubber. This paper lists the advantages of this method compared to the more usual approach of a hermetic enclosure and then presents a method to evaluate the underwater adhesive stability of six adhesive/substrate couples, using repeated lap-shear tests and an elevated temperature to accelerate the ageing process. The results for different adhesive/substrate couples tested, presented on probability plots, show that FR4 and alumina substrates with MED4-4220 silicone rubber are suitable for a first implantable prototype. We then compare these with the predicted lifetimes of bonds between historical standard silicone rubber DC3140 and different substrates and describe the encapsulation of our gastrostimulator.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerated testing", "Encapsulation", "Endoscopic implantation", "Gastric electrical stimulation", "Lap-shear test", "Obesity", "Packaging", "Silicone rubber"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerated testing", "Electrical stimulations", "Lap shear tests", "Obesity", "Silicone rubber", "Compressive Strength", "Electric Stimulation", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Gastroscopy", "Lipids", "Materials Testing", "Prostheses and Implants", "Prosthesis Design", "Silicone Elastomers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925497362", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55043230600": {"Name": "Lonys L.", "AuthorID": "55043230600", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Stimulation and Monitoring Research Group (BISTIMO), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "56507352000": {"Name": "Jul\u00e9mont N.", "AuthorID": "56507352000", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Stimulation and Monitoring Research Group (BISTIMO), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "7003888832": {"Name": "Mathys P.", "AuthorID": "7003888832", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Stimulation and Monitoring Research Group (BISTIMO), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "57218412667": {"Name": "Nonclercq A.", "AuthorID": "57218412667", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Stimulation and Monitoring Research Group (BISTIMO), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "35093291400": {"Name": "Vanhoestenberghe A.", "AuthorID": "35093291400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Implanted Devices Group, Medical Physics and Bioengineering Department, UCL"}, "6602943950": {"Name": "Godet S.", "AuthorID": "6602943950", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Materials Engineering, Characterization, Synthesis and Recycling (4MAT), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "55939905800": {"Name": "Delplancke M.P.", "AuthorID": "55939905800", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Materials Engineering, Characterization, Synthesis and Recycling (4MAT), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}}}
