Aims To evaluate the value and stability of early serial developmental assessments in predicting long-term outcome. Study design Prospective study of infants with neonatal HIE and early continuous EEG at birth. Subjects Term infants with HIE were recruited at birth. Development was measured at 6, 12 and 24 months using the Revised Griffiths\u2019 Scales (GMDS-R). Outcome measures Intellectual abilities at age five were measured using the Wechsler Preschool & Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IIIUK) and the \u2018numbers\u2019 subtest from the Children's Memory Scale. Overall five-year outcome was also reported. Results IQ outcome was available in forty-seven surviving children (28 male, 19 female: mean (SD) age 64.0(5.7) months. Mean processing speed (p = 0.01) and short-term verbal memory (p = 0.005) were below the norm. Global development (GDQ) at 6, 12 and 24 months correlated (p < 0.01) with five-year global, verbal and performance IQ with improved correlation over time. Normal GDQ throughout early childhood predicted normal IQ at 5 years (24 month AUROC value = 0.941, p = 0.001). An abnormal early GDQ score at any stage in the first 24 months had excellent negative predictive values, superior to those for neonatal Sarnat and EEG grading. Conclusions Normal early development predicts normal 5 year IQ with prediction increasing over time. Repeated measurement is warranted due to instability of findings across the first two years. Follow-up for children with abnormal early development is warranted given high sensitivity for school-age global abnormal outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive outcome", "Developmental assessment", "Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy", "IQ prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intelligence Tests", "Male", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Prospective Studies", "Wechsler Scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018478206", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"55436390500": {"Name": "O'Connor C.M.", "AuthorID": "55436390500", "AffiliationID": "60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, University College Cork, Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "35511039500": {"Name": "Ryan C.A.", "AuthorID": "35511039500", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60010410", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT Centre), Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.B.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, University College Cork, Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "14058615200": {"Name": "Murray D.M.", "AuthorID": "14058615200", "AffiliationID": "60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, University College Cork, Cork University Maternity Hospital"}}}
