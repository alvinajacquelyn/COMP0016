Although anecdotal accounts of willow bark extract as an anti-inflammatory drug have occurred since written records began (for example by Hippocrates), the first convincing demonstration of a potent anti-pyretic effect of willow bark containing salicylates was made by the English cleric Edward Stone in the late eighteenth century. Here, we discuss the route to optimizing and understanding the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs that have their origins in Stone\u2019s seminal study, \u2018An account of the success of the bark of the willow in the cure of agues\u2019. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aspirin", "Cardiovascular function", "Fever", "Inflammation", "Malaria", "Pain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "History, 18th Century", "Pharmacology", "Plant Bark", "Plant Extracts", "Salix"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924326183", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"7404353149": {"Name": "Wood J.N.", "AuthorID": "7404353149", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine and Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, Seoul National University"}}}
