Eight breast cancer samples were investigated. Each sample contained a mixture of normal and cancerous tissues. In total, 522 separate XRD measurements were made at different locations across the samples (8 in total). The resulting XRD spectra were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to determine if there were any distinguishing features that could be used to identify different tissue components. 99.0% of the variation between the spectra were described by the first two principal components (PC). Comparing the location of points in PC space with the classification determined by histopathology indicated correlation between the shape/magnitude of the XRD spectra and the tissue type. These results are encouraging and suggest that XRD could be used for the intraoperative or postoperative classification of bulk tissue samples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Breast", "Female", "Humans", "Principal Component Analysis", "X-Ray Diffraction", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031112825", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14036021200": {"Name": "Moss R.M.", "AuthorID": "14036021200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56943124300": {"Name": "Crews C.", "AuthorID": "56943124300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205908360": {"Name": "Speller R.D.", "AuthorID": "57205908360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57196036814": {"Name": "Amin A.S.", "AuthorID": "57196036814", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6603952867": {"Name": "Purdie C.A.", "AuthorID": "6603952867", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60030455", "AffiliationName": "NHS Tayside Pathology Department, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School"}, "7102823571": {"Name": "Jordan L.B.", "AuthorID": "7102823571", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60030455", "AffiliationName": "NHS Tayside Pathology Department, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School"}, "56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404362772": {"Name": "Evans A.", "AuthorID": "7404362772", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Research, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School"}, "7003581364": {"Name": "Vinnicombe S.J.", "AuthorID": "7003581364", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Research, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School"}}}
