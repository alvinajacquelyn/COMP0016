We characterize VE arising from the inferior septum of the LV base that was successfully managed by LV endocardial ablation from the inferoseptal recess of the LV. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, electrophysiological findings, and anatomical features associated with VE arising from the basal inferoseptal process of the LV (ISP-LV) ablated using an LV endocardial approach via the inferoseptal recess of the LV. Methods: A total of 425 consecutive patients undergoing VE ablation between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 at 3 centers were evaluated. Demographic characteristics, ECG findings, and procedural data were analyzed for patients with ISP-LV VEs. Results: Seven (1.5%) had a site of origin from the ISP-LV. Common ECG findings were a right bundle branch block concordant pattern or an atypical left bundle branch block early transition pattern, suggestive of a basal origin with a left superior axis, a biphasic QRS complex in lead aVR, and a small s wave in lead V 6 . Earliest activation was seen in an area below the outflow tract accessed from the inferoseptal recess inferior to the His bundle. In 3 cases, transient junctional rhythm was seen during ablation. All cases were ablated successfully with no complications. Conclusion: VE arising from the ISP-LV represents a distinct subset of idiopathic arrhythmia and can be successfully treated by endocardial catheter ablation from the inferoseptal recess. They share common surface ECG and electrophysiological findings with special anatomical features that need recognition for successful catheter ablation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catheter ablation", "Inferoseptal process", "Left ventricular ostium", "Left ventricular outflow tract", "Ventricular ectopics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Surface Potential Mapping", "Bundle of His", "Catheter Ablation", "Electrocardiography", "Endocardium", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Premature Complexes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051166375", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55559949500": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "55559949500", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical Academic Group, St. George's University of London"}, "25926228100": {"Name": "Zuberi Z.", "AuthorID": "25926228100", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical Academic Group, St. George's University of London"}, "7403364796": {"Name": "Ward D.E.", "AuthorID": "7403364796", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical Academic Group, St. George's University of London"}, "12773877200": {"Name": "Saba M.M.", "AuthorID": "12773877200", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical Academic Group, St. George's University of London"}, "35200343600": {"Name": "Bradfield J.S.", "AuthorID": "35200343600", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60032655, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "7003952173": {"Name": "Shivkumar K.", "AuthorID": "7003952173", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60032655, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "55699051300": {"Name": "Zarif J.K.", "AuthorID": "55699051300", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Ain Shams University"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}}}
