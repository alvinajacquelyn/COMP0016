OI has the potential to impact upon all family members, making it important to consider the challenges families face, how they cope and their support needs as the affected individual moves from childhood through to adult life. Objective: To conduct a mixed-methods systematic review investigating the experiences of families when a family member is affected with OI. Methods: A systematic search of seven electronic databases, relevant patient organisation websites and reference lists was conducted. Data extraction was performed for all studies that met the eligibility and quality criteria. Results were synthesised following the principles of thematic analysis. Results: One mixed-method, six qualitative and six quantitative studies were included in the review. Three overarching themes were identified through thematic analysis: Impact of OI on the psychosocial wellbeing of families, impact on family life and evolving roles and relationships. Fear of fractures and the uncertainty of when the next fracture will occur are key issues that permeate all areas of family life and impact upon all family members. Conclusion: The experiences, coping strategies and support needs of families affected by OI were highly variable and changed over time. Future research should address the need for adaptive health and education interventions that support all family members.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Family", "Mixed-methods systematic review", "Osteogenesis Imperfecta", "Psychosocial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Disabled Persons", "Family", "Fear", "Fractures, Bone", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Osteogenesis Imperfecta", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059690195", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7404448261": {"Name": "Hill M.", "AuthorID": "7404448261", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203574824": {"Name": "Riddington M.", "AuthorID": "57203574824", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205846556": {"Name": "Crowe B.", "AuthorID": "57205846556", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603598778": {"Name": "DeVile C.", "AuthorID": "6603598778", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603082244": {"Name": "G\u00f6therstr\u00f6m C.", "AuthorID": "6603082244", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science, Intervention & Technology, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
