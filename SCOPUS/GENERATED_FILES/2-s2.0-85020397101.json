The main structural unit of this compound is a copper paddle-wheel (PW) consisting of two Cu2+ ions interconnected via four carboxylate groups in the syn-syn fashion. X- and Q-band EPR measurements of this MOF allow us to probe distinct magnetic interactions of different magnitudes that originate from these dinuclear units. EPR experiments performed at different temperatures reveal that two Cu2+ ions in a single PW are antiferromagnetically coupled to the total spin S = 0 state with the exchange coupling constant J = -285 cm-1. The fine structure pattern observed in the spectra indicates the thermal population of the excited triplet S = 1 spin states of the Cu2+ pairs. Spectral simulations are used to determine the fine and hyperfine structure tensors of the PW units. At higher temperatures a collapse of the fine structure to a single EPR line is observed, indicating the interdinuclear exchange of the S = 1 spin states mediated via the isophthalate linkers. Comparison of the EPR results with the structural X-ray diffraction data reveals that the dehydration of the compound opens an additional spin triplet exchange path joining apical positions of the PWs. We estimated the effective exchange coupling constants in the as-synthesized and dehydrated forms of the compound by simulating the observed powder patterns. It is shown that the additional path is reversibly closed after the dehydrated sample is allowed to interact with air, demonstrating a peculiar relationship between the adsorbed guest molecules and magnetic properties of kagome MOFs even at room temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiferro-magnetically coupled", "Effective exchange couplings", "Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR)", "Exchange coupling constants", "Hyperfine structure", "Magnetic interactions", "Spectral simulations", "X-ray diffraction data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020397101", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7101737105": {"Name": "Matsuda R.", "AuthorID": "7101737105", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University"}, "7201690696": {"Name": "Kitagawa S.", "AuthorID": "7201690696", "AffiliationID": "60119339, 60011001", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (WPI-iCeMS), Kyoto University"}, "36875147700": {"Name": "Poppl A.", "AuthorID": "36875147700", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics and Earth Sciences, Universitat Leipzig"}}}
