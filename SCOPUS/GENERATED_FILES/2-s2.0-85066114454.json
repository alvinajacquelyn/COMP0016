To bridge the gap between the two, in this paper we propose a marriage between a probabilistic generative model, which has been shown to be robust to variability among magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired via different imaging protocols, and a CNN. The link is in the prior distribution over the unknown tissue classes, which are classically modelled using a Markov random field. In this work we model the interactions among neighbouring pixels by a type of recurrent CNN, which can encode more complex spatial interactions. We validate our proposed model on publicly available MR data, from different centres, and show that it generalises across imaging protocols. This result demonstrates a successful and principled inclusion of a CNN in a generative model, which in turn could be adapted by any probabilistic generative approach for image segmentation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Convolutional neural network", "Generative model", "Imaging protocol", "Markov Random Fields", "Mixture model", "Neuroimaging Analysis", "Prior distribution", "Spatial interaction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066114454", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56600853200": {"Name": "Brudfors M.", "AuthorID": "56600853200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "57038945800": {"Name": "Balbastre Y.", "AuthorID": "57038945800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "7004536701": {"Name": "Ashburner J.", "AuthorID": "7004536701", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}}}
