For youth today, an important marker of adulthood is self-actualization in their professional career, and, consequently, also the achievement of stable financial conditions. Economic conditions of youth are greatly subject to fluctuations in the economy, and the subsequent governmental response. Using the Luxembourg Income Study, this work investigates the trends in income from work of young adults before and after the Great Recession of 2008 in five countries\u2014US, UK, Norway, Germany, and Spain. The findings showed deterioration in economic conditions of young men, but with differences across countries. Young women suffered less from the crisis, and in some countries, their economic situation improved. The general negative trend was especially pronounced for those with high education, which is primarily because they stayed in education longer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Economic conditions", "Employment", "Great recession", "Luxembourg income study", "Transition to adulthood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031502615", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"37665949300": {"Name": "Sironi M.", "AuthorID": "37665949300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, University College London"}}}
