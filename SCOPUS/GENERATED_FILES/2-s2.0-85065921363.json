Here we report an additional patient with recessive MSTO1-related muscular dystrophy (MSTO1-RD), and clinical and radiological evidence of progressive cerebellar involvement. Whole-exome sequencing identified two novel MSTO1 missense variants, c.766C > T (p. (Arg256Trp) and c.1435C > T (p. (Pro479Ser), predicted as damaging by in silico tools. We also report a distinct pattern of selective involvement on muscle MRI in MSTO1-RD. This case confirms a consistent MSTO1-related neuromuscular phenotype and in addition suggests a progressive neurological component at least in some patients, in keeping with the mitochondrial role of the defective protein.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ataxia", "Cerebellar atrophy", "MSTO1", "Muscular dystrophy", "Progressive cerebellar involvement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cerebellar Diseases", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Male", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophies", "Mutation, Missense", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065921363", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56363135000": {"Name": "Ardicli D.", "AuthorID": "56363135000", "AffiliationID": "60011427", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, Hacettepe University Children's Hospital"}, "7003888450": {"Name": "Sarkozy A.", "AuthorID": "7003888450", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57200418582": {"Name": "Zaharieva I.", "AuthorID": "57200418582", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "26535084400": {"Name": "Phadke R.", "AuthorID": "26535084400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "23993830500": {"Name": "Deshpande C.", "AuthorID": "23993830500", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55367947400": {"Name": "Bodi I.", "AuthorID": "55367947400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuropathology, King's College Hospital"}, "7201954887": {"Name": "Siddiqui A.", "AuthorID": "7201954887", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603276879": {"Name": "U-King-Im J.M.", "AuthorID": "6603276879", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychology, Guys and St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57208839222": {"Name": "Selfe A.", "AuthorID": "57208839222", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Neuromuscular Service, Evelina's Children Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006738404": {"Name": "Jungbluth H.", "AuthorID": "7006738404", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, IoPPN, King's College London"}}}
