However, compared with Chap. 4, this chapter focuses on large-scale interconnected systems and uses reduced-order compensators in the feedback loop which is particularly important for large-scale systems to avoid \u2019the curse of dimensionality\u2019. Sliding mode dynamics are established and the stability is analysed using an equivalent control approach and a local coordinate transformation. A robust decentralised output feedback sliding mode control scheme is synthesised such that the interconnected system can be driven to the predesigned sliding surface. This approach allows both the nominal isolated subsystem and the whole nominal system to be nonminimum phase. In a second approach, a similar structure is introduced to identify a class of nonlinear large-scale interconnected systems. By exploiting the system structure of similarity, the proposed nonlinear reduced-order control schemes allow more general forms of uncertainties. The study shows that similar structures can simplify the analysis and reduce computation. Case studies on the HIRM aircraft and coupled inverted pendula, and a numerical simulation example are provided, respectively, to illustrate the results developed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Control of large-scale systems", "Curse of dimensionality", "Equivalent control", "Large-scale interconnected systems", "Output feedback sliding mode", "Reduced order control", "Sliding mode dynamics", "System structures"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042884721", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56642060300": {"Name": "Edwards C.", "AuthorID": "56642060300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
