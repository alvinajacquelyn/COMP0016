This usually begins with converting the data from original MR format to a form that can be used by the analysis software. The data are then motion corrected. If an anatomical scan is collected for the subject, then it would be coregistered with the fMRI, and may serve to estimate the warps needed to spatially normalize the fMRI to some standard space. The final processing step is usually to smooth the data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artifact correction", "fMRI", "Generative model", "Registration", "Smoothing", "Spatial normalization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988896959", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004536701": {"Name": "Ashburner J.", "AuthorID": "7004536701", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
