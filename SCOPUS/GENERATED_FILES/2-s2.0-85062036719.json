Despite government sanctions against their production they continue to be available in ever-increasing varieties over the Internet. The psychological consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use are relatively unknown. Aim: The purpose of this study was to synthesise the available research on the psychological consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use. Method: A literature search of three databases was conducted in February 2018, including the following keywords: Spice, synthetic cannabis, cognition, affect, behaviour, psychosis, depression and anxiety. Results: Seventeen studies involving a variety of participants were eligible for inclusion: one controlled administration study, seven cross-sectional studies, five Internet surveys and four qualitative studies. The controlled administration study showed that, compared to placebo, synthetic cannabinoids acutely affected some aspects of cognitive functioning and subjective psychological ratings. Non-controlled, cross-sectional studies generally showed that synthetic cannabinoid users had lower performance on cognitive tasks and showed elevated symptomatology (e.g. paranoia) compared to both natural cannabis and non-cannabis users. Methodological limitations were noted across different study designs. There is limited research on how doses, frequency or type of synthetic cannabinoid influence outcomes. Conclusions: Acute synthetic cannabinoid use can result in a range of psychological outcomes and, when non-intoxicated, synthetic cannabinoid users appear to differ from natural cannabis and non-users on various affective and cognitive domains. As synthetic cannabinoid use is increasing in at-risk populations there is an urgent need for more and better research to inform users, professionals and policymakers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affective", "anxiety", "behavioural", "cognitive", "depression", "psychological", "Synthetic cannabis", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cannabinoids", "Cognition", "Humans", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062036719", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57206858185": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "57206858185", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "55643477300": {"Name": "Mokrysz C.", "AuthorID": "55643477300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "7005313659": {"Name": "Curran H.V.", "AuthorID": "7005313659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}}}
