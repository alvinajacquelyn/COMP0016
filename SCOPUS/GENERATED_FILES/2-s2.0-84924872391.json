Density functional theory calculations and reactivity studies indicate the nitride motif to have nucleophilic character, but where the nitrogen atom can serve as a conduit for electron transfer, thus allowing the reduction of the vanadium(V) metal ion with concurrent oxidation of the incoming substrate. Silane, H2SiPh2, readily converts the nitride ligand in 1 into a primary silyl-amide functionality with concomitant two-electron reduction at the vanadium center to form the complex [(nacnac)V{N(H)SiHPh2}(OAr)] (3). Likewise, addition of the B-H bond in pinacolborane to the nitride moiety in 2 results in formation of the boryl-amide complex [(nacnac)V{N(H)B(pinacol)}(Ntolyl2)] (4). In addition to spectroscopic data, complexes 3 and 4 were also elucidated structurally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. One-electron reduction of 1 with 0.5% Na/Hg on a preparative scale allowed for the isolation and structural determination of an asymmetric bimolecular nitride radical anion complex having formula [Na]2[(nacnac)V(N)(OAr)]2 (5), in addition to room-temperature solution X-band electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924872391", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55482280000": {"Name": "Thompson R.", "AuthorID": "55482280000", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Chemistry"}, "8696330200": {"Name": "Tran B.L.", "AuthorID": "8696330200", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Structure Center, Indiana University"}, "57220950529": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "57220950529", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Structure Center, Indiana University"}, "16306300700": {"Name": "Chen C.H.", "AuthorID": "16306300700", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Structure Center, Indiana University"}, "7007174969": {"Name": "Pink M.", "AuthorID": "7007174969", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Structure Center, Indiana University"}, "7403873177": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "7403873177", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Structure Center, Indiana University"}, "7202383319": {"Name": "Carroll P.J.", "AuthorID": "7202383319", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Chemistry"}, "7006971328": {"Name": "Baik M.H.", "AuthorID": "7006971328", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Structure Center, Indiana University"}, "6701799019": {"Name": "Mindiola D.J.", "AuthorID": "6701799019", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Chemistry"}}}
