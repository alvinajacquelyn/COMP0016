All rights reserved.Urban authorities and organizations are responsible for providing the basic services that affect the lives of urban children. Cities for Children is intended to help them understand and respond to the rights and requirements of children and adolescents. It looks at the responsibilities that authorities face, and discusses practical measures for meeting their obligations in the context of limited resources and multiple demands. While the book emphasizes the challenges faced by local government, it also contains information that would be useful to any groups working to make urban areas better places for children. Cities for Children begins by introducing the concept, history and content of children's rights and the obligations they create for local authorities. The volume then goes on to look at a variety of contentious issues such as housing, community participation, working children, community health, education and juvenile justice. The final section of the book discusses the challenge of establishing systems of governance that can promote the economic security, social justice and environmental care essential for the realization of children's rights. It follows through the practical implications for the structure, policies and practices of local authorities. Written by the top experts in the field of children's issues, and including a resource section which lists publications and organizations that can provide further information and support, this volume is a must for all involved in planning for, and the protection of, children within the urban environment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070418870", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7202248304": {"Name": "Bartlett S.", "AuthorID": "7202248304", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7402599329": {"Name": "Hart R.", "AuthorID": "7402599329", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "40162788500": {"Name": "Satterthwaite D.", "AuthorID": "40162788500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "22034430200": {"Name": "de la Barra X.", "AuthorID": "22034430200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56469783100": {"Name": "Missair A.", "AuthorID": "56469783100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
