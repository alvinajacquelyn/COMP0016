They are co-regulated by voltage and Ca2+ in plant vacuoles and by the second messenger NAADP in animal endo-lysosomes. Two new studies of plant TPC structures reveal essential features of their architecture and provide mechanistic insight into their workings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arabidopsis", "Arabidopsis Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Endosomes", "Gene Expression", "Ion Channel Gating", "Lysosomes", "NADP", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Vacuoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964900933", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56247209700": {"Name": "Penny C.", "AuthorID": "56247209700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "30567748800": {"Name": "Rahman T.", "AuthorID": "30567748800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge"}}}
