The initial steps of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derivation involve transfection and long term cell culture. Integration of these steps would help reduce the cost and footprint of micro-scale devices with applications in cell reprogramming or gene correction. Current examples of transfection integration focus on maximising efficiency rather than viable long-term culture. Here we look for whole process compatibility by integrating automated transfection with a perfused microfluidic device designed for homogeneous culture conditions. The injection process was characterised using fluorescein to establish a LabVIEW-based routine for user-defined automation. Proof-of-concept is demonstrated by chemically transfecting a GFP plasmid into mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Cells transfected in the device showed an improvement in efficiency (34%, n = 3) compared with standard protocols (17.2%, n = 3). This represents a first step towards microfluidic processing systems for cell reprogramming or gene therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autologous cell therapy", "Automated transfection", "Cell culture", "Embryonic stem cells", "Microfluidic cell culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autologous cell", "Automated transfection", "Embryonic stem cells", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Micro-fluidic devices", "Microfluidic cell culture", "Microfluidic cell culture devices", "Mouse embryonic stem cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991772224", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57191593051": {"Name": "Raimes W.", "AuthorID": "57191593051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "57191592661": {"Name": "Rubi M.", "AuthorID": "57191592661", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "55532571200": {"Name": "Super A.", "AuthorID": "55532571200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "20436225500": {"Name": "Marques M.", "AuthorID": "20436225500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "10439111100": {"Name": "Veraitch F.", "AuthorID": "10439111100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "6507099937": {"Name": "Szita N.", "AuthorID": "6507099937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}}}
