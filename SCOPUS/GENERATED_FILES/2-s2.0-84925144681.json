This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.UBE2L3 is associated with increased susceptibility to numerous autoimmune diseases, but the underlying mechanism is unexplained. By using data from a genome-wide association study of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we observed a single risk haplotype spanning UBE2L3, consistently aligned across multiple autoimmune diseases, associated with increased UBE2L3 expression in B cells and monocytes. rs140490 in the UBE2L3 promoter region showed the strongest association. UBE2L3 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, specially adapted to function with HECT and RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ligases, including HOIL-1 and HOIP, components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). Our data demonstrate that UBE2L3 is the preferred E2 conjugating enzyme for LUBAC in vivo, and UBE2L3 is essential for LUBAC-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB. By accurately quantifying NF-\u03baB translocation in primary human cells from healthy individuals stratified by rs140490 genotype, we observed that the autoimmune disease risk UBE2L3 genotype was correlated with basal NF-\u03baB activation in unstimulated B cells and monocytes and regulated the sensitivity of NF-\u03baB to CD40 stimulation in B cells and TNF stimulation in monocytes. The UBE2L3 risk allele correlated with increased circulating plasmablast and plasma cell numbers in SLE individuals, consistent with substantially elevated UBE2L3 protein levels in plasmablasts and plasma cells. These results identify key immunological consequences of the UBE2L3 autoimmune risk haplotype and highlight an important role for UBE2L3 in plasmablast and plasma cell development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autoimmune Diseases", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cells, Cultured", "DNA Primers", "Flow Cytometry", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Luciferases", "Microarray Analysis", "Monocytes", "NF-kappa B", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes", "Ubiquitination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925144681", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7404188045": {"Name": "Lewis M.J.", "AuthorID": "7404188045", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Experimental Medicine and Rheumatology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57191579316": {"Name": "Vyse S.", "AuthorID": "57191579316", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Experimental Medicine and Rheumatology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "53264832400": {"Name": "Shields A.M.", "AuthorID": "53264832400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London"}, "56222403300": {"Name": "Boeltz S.", "AuthorID": "56222403300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London"}, "7003955999": {"Name": "Vyse T.J.", "AuthorID": "7003955999", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London"}, "7202833638": {"Name": "Gordon P.A.", "AuthorID": "7202833638", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department, King's College Hospital"}, "35351391300": {"Name": "Spector T.D.", "AuthorID": "35351391300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London"}, "36901078100": {"Name": "Lehner P.J.", "AuthorID": "36901078100", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
