Firstly, precursor ZIFs are rationally designed with a blend of volatile zinc to induce porosity and stable cobalt to induce graphitic domains. Secondly, the self-modulated cobalt-nitrogen-carbon system (SCNCS) is shown to be an effective ORR catalyst after graphitization at mild temperatures. Finally, the best OER catalyst is developed by enhancing graphitization of the SCNCS. For the first time, solely by switching the graphitization conditions of SCNCS, excellent ORR or OER performance is realized. This approach not only opens up a simple protocol for simultaneous optimization of nitrogen doping and graphitization at controlled cobalt concentrations, but also provide a facile method of developing such active catalysts without the use of extensive synthesis procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cobalt concentration", "Graphitic domains", "Oxygen evolution reaction", "Oxygen reduction and evolution", "Oxygen reduction reaction", "Simultaneous optimization", "Synthesis procedure", "Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970960042", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"36664352000": {"Name": "Gadipelli S.", "AuthorID": "36664352000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57189444370": {"Name": "Zhao T.", "AuthorID": "57189444370", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507489017": {"Name": "Shevlin S.", "AuthorID": "6507489017", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
