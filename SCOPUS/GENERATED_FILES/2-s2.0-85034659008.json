Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Cavity optomechanics has been used to cool the center-of-mass motion of levitated nanospheres to millikelvin temperatures. Trapping the particle in the cavity field enables high mechanical frequencies bringing the system close to the resolved-sideband regime. Here we describe a Paul trap constructed from a printed circuit board that is small enough to fit inside the optical cavity and which should enable an accurate positioning of the particle inside the cavity field. This will increase the optical damping and therefore reduce the final temperature by at least one order of magnitude. Simulations of the potential inside the trap enable us to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of trapped particles by measuring the secular frequencies as a function of the trap parameters. Lastly, we show the importance of reducing laser noise to reach lower temperatures and higher sensitivity in the phase-sensitive readout.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cavity cooling", "cavity optomechanics", "frequency noise", "levitated nanosphere", "Paul trap"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity cooling", "Cavity optomechanics", "Center of mass motion", "Charge-to-mass ratios", "Frequency noise", "Mechanical frequency", "Millikelvin temperatures", "Paul trap"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034659008", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57197775095": {"Name": "Bullier N.", "AuthorID": "57197775095", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23989469900": {"Name": "Pontin A.", "AuthorID": "23989469900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
