Moreover, aggregation of such resources will routinely be necessary, and there will be a clear need to develop a management architecture for that aggregation. Such an architecture should ascertain what can and should be aggregated by particular systems, networks, and terminals in view of better managing the collection of available resources on a heterogeneous system level, taking into account all systems', networks', and terminals' traffic requirements and technical capabilities. This article proposes such a management architecture and assesses its benefits, quantified by some particular examples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Heterogeneous access", "Heterogeneous systems", "Management architectures", "Spectrum bands", "Technical capabilities", "Traffic requirements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990935202", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"8675831700": {"Name": "Holland O.", "AuthorID": "8675831700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "55032300000": {"Name": "Aijaz A.", "AuthorID": "55032300000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "55897560600": {"Name": "Kaltenberger F.", "AuthorID": "55897560600", "AffiliationID": "60029859", "AffiliationName": "Eurecom"}, "55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "117496365", "AffiliationName": "Athena Research and Innovation Centre"}, "7003574039": {"Name": "Vivier G.", "AuthorID": "7003574039", "AffiliationID": "60112109", "AffiliationName": "Sequans Communications"}, "57220263848": {"Name": "Buczkowski M.", "AuthorID": "57220263848", "AffiliationID": "119677665", "AffiliationName": "IS-Wireless"}, "57197288664": {"Name": "Pietrzyk S.", "AuthorID": "57197288664", "AffiliationID": "119677665", "AffiliationName": "IS-Wireless"}}}
