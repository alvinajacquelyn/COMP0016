In the brain, targeted gene recombination has become a mainstream approach to study neurodegeneration or tumorigenesis. The use of the Cre-loxP system to study tumorigenesis in the adult central nervous system (CNS) can be limited, when the promoter (such as GFAP) is also transiently expressed during development, which can result in the recombination of progenies of different lineages. Engineering of transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase fused to a mutant of the human oestrogen receptor (ER) allows the circumvention of transient developmental Cre expression by inducing recombination in the adult organism. The recombination of loxP sequences occurs only in the presence of tamoxifen. Systemic administration of tamoxifen can, however, exhibit toxicity and might also recombine unwanted cell populations if the promoter driving Cre expression is active at the time of tamoxifen administration. Here, we report that a single site-specific injection of an active derivative of tamoxifen successfully activates Cre recombinase and selectively recombines tumour suppressor genes in neural progenitor cells of the subventricular zone in mice, and we demonstrate its application in a model for the generation of intrinsic brain tumours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain tumour", "Cre recombination", "Endoxifen", "Lox P system", "Tamoxifen"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Integrases", "Mice", "Neural Stem Cells", "Recombination, Genetic", "Tamoxifen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957940194", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)", "IMMU", "2401"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57113718700": {"Name": "Benedykcinska A.", "AuthorID": "57113718700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57112960700": {"Name": "Ferreira A.", "AuthorID": "57112960700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54784691600": {"Name": "Lau J.", "AuthorID": "54784691600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6506998585": {"Name": "Broni J.", "AuthorID": "6506998585", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55867579900": {"Name": "Richard-Loendt A.", "AuthorID": "55867579900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57189008852": {"Name": "Henriquez N.V.", "AuthorID": "57189008852", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006643850": {"Name": "Brandner S.", "AuthorID": "7006643850", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
