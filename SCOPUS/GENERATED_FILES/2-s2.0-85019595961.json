All rights reserved.We fractionated frontal cortical grey matter from human Alzheimer's disease and control subjects into four biochemically defined pools that represent four distinct compartments: soluble/cytosolic, peripheral membrane/vesicular cargo, integral lipid/membranous pools and aggregated/insoluble debris. Most of the readily extractable amyloid-\u03b2 remains associated with a lipid/membranous compartment. There is an exchange of amyloid-\u03b2 between the biochemical pools that was lost for the amyloid-\u03b242 species in Alzheimer's disease, consistent with the peptide being irreversibly trapped in extracellular deposits. The quantitative amyloid-\u03b2 data, combined with magnetic resonance imaging volumetric analysis of the amount of cortical grey matter in brain, allowed us to estimate the total mass of amyloid-\u03b2 in Alzheimer's disease (6.5 mg) and control (1.7 mg) brains. The threshold positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio of 1.4 equates to 5.0 \u03bcg amyloid-\u03b2/g of grey matter and the mean Alzheimer's disease dementia standard uptake value ratio level of 2.3 equates to 11.20 \u03bcg amyloid-\u03b2/g of grey matter. It takes 19 years to accumulate amyloid from the threshold positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio to the mean value observed for Alzheimer's disease dementia. This accumulation time window combined with the difference of 4.8mg of amyloid-\u03b2 between Alzheimer's disease and control brain allows for a first approximation of amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation of 28 ng/h. This equates to an estimated 2-5% of the total amyloid-\u03b2 production being deposited as insoluble plaques. Understanding these rates of amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation allows for a more quantitative approach in targeting the failure of amyloid-\u03b2 clearance in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid imaging", "amyloid-\u03b2", "biomarkers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Case-Control Studies", "Frontal Lobe", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019595961", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35103278200": {"Name": "Roberts B.", "AuthorID": "35103278200", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "55214106500": {"Name": "Lind M.", "AuthorID": "55214106500", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "56593055200": {"Name": "Wagen A.", "AuthorID": "56593055200", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "57190522690": {"Name": "Rembach A.", "AuthorID": "57190522690", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "34872663900": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "34872663900", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "26642679800": {"Name": "Ryan T.", "AuthorID": "26642679800", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "7103396821": {"Name": "McLean C.", "AuthorID": "7103396821", "AffiliationID": "60008014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomical Pathology, Alfred Hospital"}, "7103076267": {"Name": "Rowe C.", "AuthorID": "7103076267", "AffiliationID": "60005087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Centre for PET, Austin Health"}, "6701608757": {"Name": "Villemagne V.", "AuthorID": "6701608757", "AffiliationID": "60005087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Centre for PET, Austin Health"}, "35373080600": {"Name": "Masters C.", "AuthorID": "35373080600", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Kenneth Myer Building"}, "6603418674": {"Name": "Frugier T.", "AuthorID": "6603418674", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Melbourne"}, "24070206900": {"Name": "Doecke J.", "AuthorID": "24070206900", "AffiliationID": "116607508", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Health and Biosecurity, Australian E-Health Research Centre, Cooperative Research Centre of Mental Health"}}}
