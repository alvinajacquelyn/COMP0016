It is already improving patients\u2019 access to treatment and advice. Now, in combination with internet-connected diagnostic devices, it offers novel ways to diagnose, track and control infectious diseases and to improve the efficiency of the health system. Here we examine the promise of these technologies and discuss the challenges in realizing their potential to increase patients\u2019 access to testing, aid in their treatment and improve the capability of public health authorities to monitor outbreaks, implement response strategies and assess the impact of interventions across the world.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Disease Control", "Communicable Diseases", "Contact Tracing", "Data Analysis", "Disease Outbreaks", "Humans", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Public Health", "Smartphone", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062302542", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57199015095": {"Name": "Wood C.S.", "AuthorID": "57199015095", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57192977228": {"Name": "Thomas M.R.", "AuthorID": "57192977228", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57207206009": {"Name": "Budd J.", "AuthorID": "57207206009", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56281917500": {"Name": "Mashamba-Thompson T.P.", "AuthorID": "56281917500", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Public Health Medicine, School of Nursing and Public Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "16645460600": {"Name": "Herbst K.", "AuthorID": "16645460600", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, Durban"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7005844347": {"Name": "Peeling R.W.", "AuthorID": "7005844347", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
