Classification is predominantly based on histological features, which is difficult due to the broad histological spectrum of these tumours. The aim of the present study was to find molecular markers that can be used to identify entities within the histopathology spectrum of glioneuronal tumours. The focus of this study was on microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are involved in the pathogenesis of different neurological diseases and oncogenesis. Using a miRNA array, miR-519d and miR- 4758 were found to be upregulated in gangliogliomas (n=26) compared to control cortex (n=17), peritumoural tissue (n=7), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (n=9) and astrocytomas (grade I-IV; subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, n=10;pilocytic astrocytoma, n=15; diffuse astrocytoma grade II, n=10; grade III, n=14 and glioblastoma n=15). Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT3/P21 pathway, which is predicated to be targeted by miR-519d and miR-4758, was deregulated in gangliogliomas. Functionally, overexpression of miR-519d in an astrocytic cell line resulted in a downregulation of CDKN1A (P21) and an increase in cell proliferation, whereas cotransfection with miR-4758 counteracted this effect. These results suggest that miR- 519d and miR-4758 might work in concert as regulators of the cell cycle in low grade gliomas. Furthermore, these miRNAs could be used to distinguish gangliogliomas from dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours and other low and high grade gliomas and may lead to more targeted therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour", "Epilepsy", "Ganglioglioma", "Glioneuronal tumour", "Low-grade epilepsy-associated brain tumours"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048644673", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57195370985": {"Name": "Bongaarts A.", "AuthorID": "57195370985", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "15729970300": {"Name": "Prabowo A.", "AuthorID": "15729970300", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "56529785600": {"Name": "Arena A.", "AuthorID": "56529785600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "36990171400": {"Name": "Anink J.", "AuthorID": "36990171400", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "55612875000": {"Name": "Reinten R.", "AuthorID": "55612875000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "55530992700": {"Name": "Mills J.", "AuthorID": "55530992700", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7005889376": {"Name": "Iyer A.", "AuthorID": "7005889376", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57202511552": {"Name": "Vliet E.", "AuthorID": "57202511552", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "36940941000": {"Name": "M\u00fchlebner A.", "AuthorID": "36940941000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7005153143": {"Name": "Aronica E.", "AuthorID": "7005153143", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland"}, "7102799530": {"Name": "Jansen F.", "AuthorID": "7102799530", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "6602646547": {"Name": "Spliet W.", "AuthorID": "6602646547", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7004423623": {"Name": "Thom M.", "AuthorID": "7004423623", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuropathology Department, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "16642275100": {"Name": "Coras R.", "AuthorID": "16642275100", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, University Hospital Erlangen"}, "57203076556": {"Name": "Bl\u00fcmcke I.", "AuthorID": "57203076556", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, University Hospital Erlangen"}, "6603482231": {"Name": "Kotulska K.", "AuthorID": "6603482231", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Epileptology, Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "56155514700": {"Name": "Jozwiak S.", "AuthorID": "56155514700", "AffiliationID": "60069009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Neurology, Medical University of Warsaw"}, "15044394300": {"Name": "Grajkowska W.", "AuthorID": "15044394300", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "7003658129": {"Name": "S\u00f6ylemezoglu F.", "AuthorID": "7003658129", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University"}, "7006096045": {"Name": "Pimentel J.", "AuthorID": "7006096045", "AffiliationID": "60021007", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital de Santa Maria"}, "28267973800": {"Name": "Meeteren A.", "AuthorID": "28267973800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60070178, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center,University of Amsterdam"}}}
