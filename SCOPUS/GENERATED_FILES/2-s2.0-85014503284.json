Methods From the National Pupil Database, we used Key Stage 2 scores, national test scores in school year 6 at 11\u00e2 \u20ac..years of age, to explore the hypothesis that erythromycin and co-Amoxiclav were associated with poorer educational outcomes within the ORACLE Children Study. Results Anonymised scores for 97% of surviving children born to mothers recruited to ORACLE and resident in England were analysed against treatment group adjusting for key available socio-demographic potential confounders. No association with crude or with adjusted scores for English, mathematics or science was observed by maternal antibiotic group in either women with preterm rupture of membranes or spontaneous preterm labour with intact membranes. While the proportion receiving special educational needs was similar in each group (range 31.6-34.4%), it was higher than the national rate of 19%. Conclusions Despite evidence that antibiotics are associated with increased functional impairment at 7\u00e2 \u20ac..years, educational test scores and special needs at 11\u00e2 \u20ac..years of age show no differences between trial groups.
