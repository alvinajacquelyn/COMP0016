The overpopulation of Demodex spp. that causes dermatological changes is generally associated with a compromised immune system. We describe the gross and histological features of generalized demodicosis in an adult female African straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) drawn from a captive research colony. The histology of the lesions revealed comedones and follicular infundubular cysts harbouring numerous Demodex spp. mites, eliciting a minimal inflammatory response in the adjacent dermis. The histological examination of a full set of tissues did not reveal clear evidence of immunosuppression, although a clinical history of recent abortion and possible stressors due to captivity could be considered risk factors for the demodicosis. Attempts to determine the Demodex species using PCR on DNA extracted from the formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue failed. This is the first clinical and histological description of demodicosis in Eidolon helvum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bat", "Demodex", "Dermatology", "Veterinary pathology", "Wildlife diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Zoo", "Chiroptera", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Ghana", "Mite Infestations", "Mites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069644119", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"57207797077": {"Name": "Bianco C.", "AuthorID": "57207797077", "AffiliationID": "60110447", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Department, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA-Lasswade)"}, "24366876700": {"Name": "Nu\u00f1ez A.", "AuthorID": "24366876700", "AffiliationID": "60110447", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Department, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA-Weybridge)"}, "57203072151": {"Name": "Baker K.S.", "AuthorID": "57203072151", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool"}, "57210143086": {"Name": "Pazzini L.", "AuthorID": "57210143086", "AffiliationID": "118807118", "AffiliationName": "La Vallonea Veterinary Laboratory"}, "56576425500": {"Name": "Cafiso A.", "AuthorID": "56576425500", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan"}, "24377187500": {"Name": "Suu-Ire R.D.", "AuthorID": "24377187500", "AffiliationID": "60071888", "AffiliationName": "Veterinary Services, Ministry of Food and Agriculture"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7404353992": {"Name": "Wood J.L.N.", "AuthorID": "7404353992", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
