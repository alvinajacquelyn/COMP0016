However this process is often based on over-simplistic conceptions of tradition and history that fail to take into account the dynamic nature of 'traditions' and underestimate the importance of contextual factors in their interpretation. Materials and methods As part of a process of defining good practice for a clinical trial of CHM for recurrent urinary tract infections, a selective review of classical Chinese medical texts was undertaken to investigate the historical treatment of urinary diseases specified by the traditional category of Lin diseases. Results The historical review provided interesting insights into the evolution and meaning of Lin diseases and how pertinent data may be found, precisely, outside the boundaries of the categories on which the original investigation was premised. Although there were interesting parallels and continuities in the classical and modern understandings of the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of urinary diseases, there were also important divergences. Conclusions It became apparent that, in the search for 'traditional' herbs to treat a particular modern syndrome it is essential to contextualise remedies, including as far as possible the intertextual, social, cultural, and gender context, and conditions of practice. Historical ethnopharmacology adds a level of subtlety and complexity to over-simplistic attempts at bioprospecting. Some insights that emerged from this historical review could inform the proposed clinical trial but these have had to be filtered through the constraints of modern regulatory procedures. Further research is required on how best to integrate the wealth of data that exists in historical texts with the desire to produce effective herbal products for the modern world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinese herbal medicine", "Clinical trial", "Historical ethnopharmacology", "Historical review", "History", "Urinary tract diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Medicine, Chinese Traditional", "Phytotherapy", "Recurrence", "Urinary Tract Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934962874", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57197979635": {"Name": "Barrett P.", "AuthorID": "57197979635", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "China Centre for Health and Humanity, Department of History, UCL"}, "7005645870": {"Name": "Lo V.", "AuthorID": "7005645870", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "China Centre for Health and Humanity, Department of History, UCL"}, "23027691300": {"Name": "Flower A.", "AuthorID": "23027691300", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}}}
