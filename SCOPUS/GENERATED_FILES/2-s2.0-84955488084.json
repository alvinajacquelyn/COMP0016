Mice with conditional deficiency of Was in B lymphocytes (B/WcKO) have revealed a critical role for WAS protein (WASP) expression in B lymphocytes in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Neural WASP (N-WASP) is a broadly expressed homolog of WASP, and regulates B-cell signaling bymodulating B-cell receptor (BCR) clustering and internalization.Wehave generated a double conditional mouse lacking both WASP and N-WASP selectively in B lymphocytes (B/DcKO). Compared with B/WcKO mice, B/DcKO mice showed defective B-lymphocyte proliferation and impaired antibody responses to T-celldependent antigens, associated with decreased autoantibody production and lack of autoimmune kidney disease. These results demonstrate that N-WASP expression in B lymphocytes is required for the development of autoimmunity of WAS and may represent a novel therapeutic target in WAS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autoimmunity", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Gene Deletion", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell", "Signal Transduction", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955488084", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57217208043": {"Name": "Volpi S.", "AuthorID": "57217208043", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, University of Genoa and Unita Operativa Pediatria 2"}, "57216938747": {"Name": "Abernethy K.", "AuthorID": "57216938747", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "6602499065": {"Name": "Recher M.", "AuthorID": "6602499065", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "56690448000": {"Name": "Capuder K.", "AuthorID": "56690448000", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "57075699400": {"Name": "Ryan D.", "AuthorID": "57075699400", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "55131056100": {"Name": "Mathew D.", "AuthorID": "55131056100", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "34768650200": {"Name": "Notarangelo L.D.", "AuthorID": "34768650200", "AffiliationID": "60027452", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Stem Cell Institute"}, "56394317400": {"Name": "Santori E.", "AuthorID": "56394317400", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Center of Epalinges, Division of Immunology and Allergy, University Hospital of Lausanne"}, "57076986100": {"Name": "Candott F.", "AuthorID": "57076986100", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Center of Epalinges, Division of Immunology and Allergy, University Hospital of Lausanne"}, "8935909200": {"Name": "Mizui M.", "AuthorID": "8935909200", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "7102641544": {"Name": "Tsokos G.C.", "AuthorID": "7102641544", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "36930023000": {"Name": "Dahlberg C.I.M.", "AuthorID": "36930023000", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Karolinska Institutet, Tumor and Cell Biology"}, "57205945594": {"Name": "Westerberg L.S.", "AuthorID": "57205945594", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Karolinska Institutet, Tumor and Cell Biology"}, "6602520488": {"Name": "Csizmadia E.", "AuthorID": "6602520488", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Transplantation Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "7003969189": {"Name": "Snapper S.", "AuthorID": "7003969189", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Division, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunodeficiency, Section of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, National Health Service Foundation Trust"}}}
