Management operations performed by CDNs are usually applied only based on limited information about Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks, which can have a negative impact on the utilization of ISP resources. To overcome these issues, previous research efforts have been investigating ISP-operated content delivery services, by which an ISP can deploy its own in-network caching infrastructure and implement its own cache management strategies. In this paper, we extend our previous work on ISP-operated content distribution and develop a novel scalable and efficient distributed approach to control the placement of content in the available caching points. The proposed approach relies on parallelizing the decision-making process and the use of network partitioning to cluster the distributed decision-making points, which enables fast reconfiguration and limits the volume of information required to take reconfiguration decisions. We evaluate the performance of our approach based on a wide range of parameters. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution can outperform previous approaches in terms of management overhead and complexity while offering similar network and caching performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cache management", "content delivery networks", "content placement", "network partitioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cache management", "Content delivery network", "Content delivery services", "content placement", "Decision making process", "Distributed decision making", "Internet service providers (ISP)", "Network partitioning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983435026", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36184239500": {"Name": "Tuncer D.", "AuthorID": "36184239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15726695000": {"Name": "Sourlas V.", "AuthorID": "15726695000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14010012200": {"Name": "Charalambides M.", "AuthorID": "14010012200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55827835700": {"Name": "Claeys M.", "AuthorID": "55827835700", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, IMinds"}, "6701710921": {"Name": "De Turck F.", "AuthorID": "6701710921", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, IMinds"}, "24764905200": {"Name": "Famaey J.", "AuthorID": "24764905200", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Antwerp, IMinds"}}}
