It is an important behavioural marker representing evolutionary changes in ecology, cognition, language and social behaviours. While the earliest weapons are often considered to be hand-held and consequently short-ranged, the subsequent appearance of distance weapons is a crucial development. Projectiles are seen as an improvement over contact weapons, and are considered by some to have originated only with our own species in the Middle Stone Age and Upper Palaeolithic. Despite the importance of distance weapons in the emergence of full behavioral modernity, systematic experimentation using trained throwers to evaluate the ballistics of thrown spears during flight and at impact is lacking. This paper addresses this by presenting results from a trial of trained javelin athletes, providing new estimates for key performance parameters. Overlaps in distances and impact energies between hand-thrown spears and spearthrowers are evidenced, and skill emerges as a significant factor in successful use. The results show that distance hunting was likely within the repertoire of hunting strategies of Neanderthals, and the resulting behavioural flexibility closely mirrors that of our own species.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Cognition", "Forensic Anthropology", "Forensic Ballistics", "Fossils", "Humans", "Neanderthals", "Weapons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060554700", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55810983600": {"Name": "Milks A.", "AuthorID": "55810983600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55811025000": {"Name": "Pope M.", "AuthorID": "55811025000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57205555905": {"Name": "Parker D.", "AuthorID": "57205555905", "AffiliationID": "122026178", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Sport (UK) Limited"}}}
