PARP isoforms 1 and 2 are critically charged with the surveillance of DNA integrity and are the first line guardians of the genome against DNA breaks. Here we present a novel probe ([18F]-SuPAR) for noninvasive imaging of PARP-1/2 activity using positron emission tomography (PET). [18F]-SuPAR is a radiofluorinated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analog that can be recognized by PARP-1/2 and incorporated into the long branched polymers of poly(ADP ribose) (PAR). The measurement of PARP-1/2 activity was supported by a reduction of radiotracer uptake in vivo following PARP-1/2 inhibition with talazoparib treatment, a potent PARP inhibitor recently approved by FDA for treatment of breast cancer, as well as ex vivo colocalization of radiotracer analog and poly(ADP ribose). With [18F]-SuPAR, we were able to map the dose- and time-dependent activation of PARP-1/2 following radiation therapy in breast and cervical cancer xenograft mouse models. Tumor response to therapy was determined by [18F]-SuPAR PET within 8 h of administration of a single dose of radiation equivalent to one round of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065059862", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"6507905560": {"Name": "Shuhendler A.", "AuthorID": "6507905560", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "57208554737": {"Name": "Cui L.", "AuthorID": "57208554737", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "35801355800": {"Name": "Shen B.", "AuthorID": "35801355800", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "57208554061": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57208554061", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "55612805100": {"Name": "James M.", "AuthorID": "55612805100", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "26641518000": {"Name": "Witney T.", "AuthorID": "26641518000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "7101904349": {"Name": "Gambhir S.", "AuthorID": "7101904349", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Bioengineering and Materials Sciences and Engineering, Stanford University"}, "7005101917": {"Name": "Chin F.", "AuthorID": "7005101917", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford"}, "7004397938": {"Name": "Graves E.", "AuthorID": "7004397938", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}, "7402367741": {"Name": "Rao J.", "AuthorID": "7402367741", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry"}, "57195639429": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57195639429", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry"}, "16835969800": {"Name": "Bazalova-Carter M.", "AuthorID": "16835969800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}}}
