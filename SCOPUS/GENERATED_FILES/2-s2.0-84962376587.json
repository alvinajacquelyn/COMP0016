Two technologies are routinely used in order to analyse metabolite profiles in biological fluids: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), the latter typically with hyphenation to a chromatography system such as liquid chromatography (LC), in a configuration known as LC-MS. With both NMR and MS-based detection technologies, the identification of the metabolites in the biological sample remains a significant obstacle and bottleneck. This article provides guidance on methods for metabolite identification in biological fluids using NMR spectroscopy, and is illustrated with examples from recent studies on mice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metabolite identification", "Metabolomics", "Metabonomics", "Molecular structure", "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological fluids", "Biological samples", "Detection technology", "Metabolite identification", "Metabolite profiles", "Metabolomics", "Metabonomics", "Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962376587", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"22940263000": {"Name": "Dona A.", "AuthorID": "22940263000", "AffiliationID": "60011192, 60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Kolling Institute of Medical Sciences, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "56730548400": {"Name": "Kyriakides M.", "AuthorID": "56730548400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "8400217100": {"Name": "Veselkov K.", "AuthorID": "8400217100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56156451000": {"Name": "Scott F.", "AuthorID": "56156451000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56425678900": {"Name": "Shephard E.", "AuthorID": "56425678900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56672840800": {"Name": "Varshavi D.", "AuthorID": "56672840800", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Medway Metabonomics Research Group, University of Greenwich, Chatham Maritime"}, "7102558417": {"Name": "Everett J.", "AuthorID": "7102558417", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Medway Metabonomics Research Group, University of Greenwich, Chatham Maritime"}}}
