Based on the spatial reciprocity in a wireless channel, the downlink channel is reconstructed by using frequency-independent parameters. First, we estimate the gains, delays, and angles during uplink sounding. The gains are then refined through downlink training and sent back to the base station (BS). With limited overhead, the refinement can substantially improve the accuracy of the downlink channel reconstruction. The BS can then reconstruct the downlink channel with the uplink-estimated delays and angles and the downlink-refined gains. We also introduce and extend the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm to detect the delays and gains in a multi-Antenna multi-subcarrier condition. The results of our analysis show that the extended NOMP algorithm achieves high-estimation accuracy. The simulations and over-The-Air tests are performed to assess the performance of the efficient downlink channel reconstruction scheme. The results show that the reconstructed channel is close to the practical channel and that the accuracy is enhanced when the number of BS antennas increases, thereby highlighting the promising application of the proposed scheme in large-scale antenna array systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["downlink channel reconstruction", "Frequency division duplex", "multi-Antenna", "over-The-Air test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna array system", "Downlink channels", "Frequency independent", "Frequency-division duplexes", "Multi antennas", "Multi-antenna systems", "Orthogonal matching pursuit", "Over the airs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067109014", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56296819200": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "56296819200", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "57202802378": {"Name": "Hsu T.", "AuthorID": "57202802378", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "7201367144": {"Name": "Wen C.", "AuthorID": "7201367144", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
