We hypothesised that early-life cognition and social/educational advantage may confound the relationship. Methods: From the population-based British 1946 birth cohort, a maximum number of 1780 participants had metabolic variables (type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance [HOMA2-IR] and HbA1c) assessed at age 60\u201364 years, and cognitive state (Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination III [ACE-III]) and verbal memory assessed at age 69 years. Earlier-life measures included socioeconomic position (SEP), cognition at age 8 years and educational attainment. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for type 2 diabetes were calculated. We first used a PRS approach with multivariable linear regression to estimate associations between PRSs and metabolic traits and later-life cognitive state. Second, using a path model approach, we estimated the interrelationships between earlier-life measures, features of mid-life type 2 diabetes and cognitive state at age 69 years. All models were adjusted for sex. Results: The externally weighted PRS for type 2 diabetes was associated with mid-life metabolic traits (e.g. HOMA2-IR \u03b2 = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02, 0.16]), but not with ACE-III (\u03b2 = 0.04 [\u22120.02, 0.90]) or other cognitive outcomes. While there was an association between HOMA2-IR and subsequent ACE-III (\u03b2 = \u22120.09 [\u22120.15, \u22120.03]), path modelling showed no direct effect (\u03b2 = \u22120.01 [\u22120.06, 0.03]) after accounting for the association between childhood SEP and education with HOMA2-IR. The same pattern was observed for later-life verbal memory. Conclusions/interpretation: Associations between type 2 diabetes and mid-life metabolic traits with subsequent cognitive state do not appear causal, and instead they may be explained by SEP in early life, childhood cognition and educational attainment. Therefore, glucose-lowering medication may be unlikely to combat cognitive impairment in older age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive ageing", "Cognitive function", "Insulin resistance", "Life course", "Older age", "Type 2 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Glycated Hemoglobin A", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069930307", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"57210000595": {"Name": "James S.N.", "AuthorID": "57210000595", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}, "57205235639": {"Name": "Wong A.", "AuthorID": "57205235639", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}, "35412645300": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "35412645300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}}}
