A particular motivation of this study is to use realistic measurement protocols for practical applications, i.e. we do not assume to have a full Radon transform in each time step, but only projections in few angular directions. This restriction enforces a space-time reconstruction, which we perform by incorporating physical motion models and regularization of motion vectors in a variational framework. The methodology of optical flow, which is one of the most common methods to estimate motion between two images, is utilized to formulate a joint variational model for reconstruction and motion estimation. We provide a basic mathematical analysis of the forward model and the variational model for the image reconstruction. Moreover, we discuss the efficient numerical minimization based on alternating minimizations between images and motion vectors. A variety of results are presented for simulated and real measurement data with different sampling strategy. A key observation is that random sampling combined with our model allows reconstructions of similar amount of measurements and quality as a single static reconstruction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamic inverse problems", "motion estimation", "undersampled data", "variational reconstruction", "x-ray tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating minimization", "Dynamic inverse problems", "Mathematical analysis", "Numerical minimization", "Under-sampled", "Variational framework", "Variational reconstruction", "X-ray tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038423823", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7201465443": {"Name": "Burger M.", "AuthorID": "7201465443", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Numerische und Angewandte Mathematik, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (WWU) M\u00fcnster"}, "57193614908": {"Name": "Dirks H.", "AuthorID": "57193614908", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Numerische und Angewandte Mathematik, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (WWU) M\u00fcnster"}, "57205768895": {"Name": "Frerking L.", "AuthorID": "57205768895", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Numerische und Angewandte Mathematik, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (WWU) M\u00fcnster"}, "56180904900": {"Name": "Hauptmann A.", "AuthorID": "56180904900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "35147737300": {"Name": "Helin T.", "AuthorID": "35147737300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}, "6701640093": {"Name": "Siltanen S.", "AuthorID": "6701640093", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}}}
