Design Cross-sectional. Setting Online survey. Participants A total of 194 student-athletes (112 female and 82 male). Main Outcome Measures Socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of human nutrition, energy drink consumption habits. Analysis Chi-square tests of independence, independent t tests, and hierarchical regression analyses were applied. Results Most student-athletes in the sample (85.5%) did not consume energy drinks, but those who did tended to be male (P = .004), had lower overall knowledge of nutrition (P = .02), and had a lower grade point average (P < .001) than did nonusers. Also, energy drink consumption was associated with the overall nutrition knowledge score when adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, with nonusers having greater nutrition knowledge (P = .007) than users. Conclusions and Implications Student-athletes tend to refrain from energy drink use but those who use it have a tendency to have lower nutrition knowledge than do nonusers. Therefore, nutrition education targeted toward student-athletes should encompass the consumption of energy drinks because limited evidence shows the benefits of collegiate athletes consuming energy drinks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["college students", "energy drink consumption", "nutrition knowledge", "nutritional supplements", "sports", "student-athletes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Athletes", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diet", "Energy Drinks", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Nutrition Surveys", "Students", "Universities", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992047471", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57191614029": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57191614029", "AffiliationID": "100944326", "AffiliationName": "Heartland Orthopedic Specialists, Douglas County Hospital"}, "57202618010": {"Name": "Brand J.", "AuthorID": "57202618010", "AffiliationID": "100944326", "AffiliationName": "Heartland Orthopedic Specialists, Douglas County Hospital"}, "55543645200": {"Name": "Kliemann N.", "AuthorID": "55543645200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "57191613137": {"Name": "Evansen T.", "AuthorID": "57191613137", "AffiliationID": "60022682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Minnesota Morris"}}}
