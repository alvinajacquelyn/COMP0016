PMMR has a high diagnostic accuracy for congenital and acquired fetal neuropathological anomalies compared to conventional autopsy, and is particularly useful when autopsy is non-diagnostic. The main objectives of this review are to describe and illustrate the range of common normal and abnormal central nervous system (CNS) findings encountered during PMMR investigation. This article covers the standard PMMR sequences used at our institution, normal physiological post-mortem findings, and a range of abnormal developmental and acquired conditions. The abnormal findings include diseases ranging from neural tube defects, posterior fossa malformations, those of forebrain and commissural development as well as neoplastic, haemorrhagic, and infectious aetiologies. Neuropathological findings at conventional autopsy accompany many of the conditions we describe, allowing readers to better understand the underlying disease processes and imaging appearances.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Diagnosis", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "Postmortem Changes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027413034", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55545709400": {"Name": "Shelmerdine S.C.", "AuthorID": "55545709400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Biophysics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
