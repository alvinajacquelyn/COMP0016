Here we summarise the current state of the art in the field, paying particular attention to the underlying mechanisms of switching, which involves the creation of defects in the oxide. We also describe potential technological applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922894348", "SubjectAreas": [["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55236732600": {"Name": "Mehonic A.", "AuthorID": "55236732600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}}}
