All rights reserved.This title was first published in 2000: Improved communication links between urban and rural areas and an increase in property prices in urban regions have made commuting an attractive option for European town and city dwellers eager to 'escape' urban living. This has lead to a proliferation of second homes in certain remote or deep rural areas, and this trend is compounding problems that are already affecting the indigenous populations in these areas - such as socio-economic decline, agricultural depression, a lack of services, and unaffordable house prices. Consequently, many politicians in European Member States are calling for the introduction of housing and planning laws to control the proliferation of second home ownership. This book addresses the origins of second home growth, the nature of ownership and demand, the economic costs and benefits and the environmental and social impacts of second homes. It also considers policy and practical responses at European, UK and local levels. The book will be invaluable reading for students and policy analysts in the fields of rural geography, planning, politics, housing studies and cultural studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049273609", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"6701406723": {"Name": "Gallent N.", "AuthorID": "6701406723", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "7003292806": {"Name": "Tewdwr-Jones M.", "AuthorID": "7003292806", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Department of Land Economy, University ofA berdeen"}}}
