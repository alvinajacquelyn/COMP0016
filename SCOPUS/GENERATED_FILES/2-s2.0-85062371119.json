However, the effects of institutional maturity on PPP utilization within this domain remain understudied. In order to (re)define PPPs within the NPG paradigm, we develop a PPP institutional maturity model based on three institutional capabilities-legitimacy, trust, and capacity. We then use the U.S. PPP market as a case example to explore how the maturity of PPPs in an institutional setting depends on legitimacy, trust, and capacity in the PPP model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["institutional maturity", "New public governance (NPG)", "public management", "public-private partnership (PPP)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062371119", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57207251734": {"Name": "Casady C.B.", "AuthorID": "57207251734", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University"}, "7102848199": {"Name": "Levitt R.E.", "AuthorID": "7102848199", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University"}, "7202997668": {"Name": "Eriksson K.", "AuthorID": "7202997668", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Abo Akademi University"}, "57203598350": {"Name": "Scott W.R.", "AuthorID": "57203598350", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Stanford University"}}}
