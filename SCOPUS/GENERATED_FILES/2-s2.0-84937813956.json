The project attempts to respond in new ways to enduring challenges facing geography teachers in schools. These include the need to find convincing expression of geography's contribution to the education of all young people and coping with the apparent divergence of geography in educational settings and its highly disparate expression as a research discipline in university departments. The project also hopes to contribute to the development of a framework for communicating the aims and purposes of geography in schools internationally, because here, too, there is great variety in definitions of national standards and even of disciplinary allegiances (including, e.g., the social studies, humanities, and biological sciences). GeoCapabilities does not seek to flatten such divergences, for one of geography's great strengths is its breadth. The long-term goal is to establish a secure platform for the international development of teachers\u2019 capacities as creative and disciplined innovators. The project encourages teachers to think beyond program delivery and implementation and to embrace their role as the curriculum makers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capabilities approach", "curriculum making", "geography education", "human potential", "powerful disciplinary knowledge"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937813956", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"7401508441": {"Name": "Lambert D.", "AuthorID": "7401508441", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment, University College London Institute of Education"}, "6701732365": {"Name": "Solem M.", "AuthorID": "6701732365", "AffiliationID": "113378906", "AffiliationName": "Association of American Geographers"}, "7103352551": {"Name": "Tani S.", "AuthorID": "7103352551", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Teacher Education, University of Helsinki"}}}
