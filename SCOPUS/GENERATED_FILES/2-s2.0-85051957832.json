This system allows expression of the spatial navigation and neuronal firing patterns characteristic of real open arenas (R). Comparing VR to R: place and grid, but not head-direction, cell firing had broader spatial tuning; place, but not grid, cell firing was more directional; theta frequency increased less with running speed, whereas increases in firing rates with running speed and place and grid cells\u2019 theta phase precession were similar. These results suggest that the omni-directional place cell firing in R may require local-cues unavailable in VR, and that the scale of grid and place cell firing patterns, and theta frequency, reflect translational motion inferred from both virtual (visual and proprioceptive) and real (vestibular translation and extra-maze) cues. By contrast, firing rates and theta phase precession appear to reflect visual and proprioceptive cues alone.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cues", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Grid Cells", "Head Movements", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Models, Neurological", "Orientation", "Place Cells", "Restraint, Physical", "Space Perception", "Spatial Navigation", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Theta Rhythm", "User-Computer Interface", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051957832", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55546323600": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "55546323600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57203503308": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57203503308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "8347859700": {"Name": "Cacucci F.", "AuthorID": "8347859700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7404245327": {"Name": "King J.", "AuthorID": "7404245327", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
