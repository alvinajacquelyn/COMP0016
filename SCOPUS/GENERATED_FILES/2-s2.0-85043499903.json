This study assesses the recovery potential of major waste flows in the global paper life cycle to support improvements in material use. The \u201crecovery potential\u201d indicator shows the technical possibility for extracting value from waste through recycling and other forms of recovery. The potential is identified through a review of recovery technologies that are currently applied or likely to be commercially available by the year 2050. The analysis compares current material use in the global paper life cycle with an ideal scenario in which the recovery potential of all major waste flows is fulfilled. In the ideal scenario, the Recycled Input Ratio (RIR) is increased from 38% to 67%\u201373% and the landfill intensity is reduced from 331\u2013473 kg/t paper to 0\u20132.6 kg/t paper. The reduction in required landfill space is achieved mainly through increased consumer waste recycling. Better management of industrial waste from the paper sector has a rather limited impact on the RIR and landfill intensity. The conditions for successful recovery of waste are discussed separately. The analysis shows that the recovery potential indicator can be usefully applied to estimate potential improvements in complex material systems and the findings may inform policies for resource efficiency and the circular economy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Industrial symbiosis", "Pulp and paper", "Recovery potential", "Recycling", "Waste management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex materials", "Economic opportunities", "Industrial symbiosis", "Natural environments", "Potential indicators", "Pulp and paper", "Recovery technology", "Resource efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043499903", "SubjectAreas": [["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56439947900": {"Name": "van Ewijk S.", "AuthorID": "56439947900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London (UCL)"}, "55854842600": {"Name": "Park J.Y.", "AuthorID": "55854842600", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Energy and the Environment (KU-KIST Green School), Korea University"}, "6603164738": {"Name": "Chertow M.R.", "AuthorID": "6603164738", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, Yale University"}}}
