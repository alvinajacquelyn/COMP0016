Methods and results: We assessed LA function by speckle-tracking echocardiography in 124 patients with CA and sinus rhythm: 68 with light chain (AL), 29 with mutant (ATTRm), 27 with wild-type (ATTRwt) transthyretin amyloidosis. Conventional and strain-derived parameters, including LA peak longitudinal strain (LS) and strain rate (peak LSR: reservoir function; early LSR: conduit function; late LSR: active function), were assessed compared between CA patients and 20 healthy controls of similar age and gender. All LA function phases, including LA longitudinal strain, peak LSR, early and late LSR were significantly impaired in CA compared to healthy controls after adjusting for LA size, LV ejection fraction and LV filling pressures (E/E') (all P < 0.05). Peak LA LS was moderately correlated with LV global LS (R = -0.60, P < 0.001); late LSR was correlated with A wave at the level of LV inflow (R = -0.69, P < 0.001). Among the different CA subtypes, peak LS and LA active emptying fraction were worse in ATTRwt than AL and ATTRm [P < 0.05 after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, LA volume index, severity of mitral regurgitation, left ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (E/E')]. Conclusion: In CA, LA function was severely impaired and highly correlated with LV deformation. Differences in LA function between amyloid subtypes suggest that amyloid aetiology plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in CA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D speckle tracking", "amyloid", "cardiomyopathy", "echocardiography", "left atrial function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloidosis", "Atrial Function, Left", "Cardiomyopathies", "Case-Control Studies", "Disease Progression", "Echocardiography, Doppler", "Europe", "Female", "Heart Atria", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Internationality", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Reference Values", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Stroke Volume"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034104372", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"25722243700": {"Name": "Nochioka K.", "AuthorID": "25722243700", "AffiliationID": "60180317, 60011374", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Clinical Research, Innovation and Education Center, Tohoku University Hospital"}, "36871489900": {"Name": "Claggett B.", "AuthorID": "36871489900", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "55967147700": {"Name": "Roca G.Q.", "AuthorID": "55967147700", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7401460954": {"Name": "Solomon S.D.", "AuthorID": "7401460954", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "56619484400": {"Name": "Quarta C.C.", "AuthorID": "56619484400", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bolonga, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi"}, "7005883289": {"Name": "Rapezzi C.", "AuthorID": "7005883289", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bolonga, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi"}, "7202742555": {"Name": "Falk R.H.", "AuthorID": "7202742555", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746, 60029245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Cardiac Amyloidosis Program, Harvard Medical School"}}}
