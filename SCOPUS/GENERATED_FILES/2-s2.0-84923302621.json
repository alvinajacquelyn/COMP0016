Over 4,000 adult managers attending an assessment center completed a battery of tests including a bright side, normal personality trait measures (NEO Personality Inventory\u2014Revised, or NEO-PI-R); a dark side/disorders measure (Hogan Development Survey, or HDS), an ability test (Graduate Management Assessment Test, or GMA), and the Consequences Test of DT scored twice. Personality disorder variables (dark side) accounted for incremental variance over the Big Five (bright side) and intelligence, which were also positively related to test scores. Disorder variables accounted for around 4\u20139% of the variance. Imaginative (schizotypal) and colorful (histrionic) scores were best positive predictors and diligent (obsessive compulsive) and sceptical (paranoid) most negative predictors of the DT measures. Implications for the selection and management of creative people are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923302621", "SubjectAreas": [["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
