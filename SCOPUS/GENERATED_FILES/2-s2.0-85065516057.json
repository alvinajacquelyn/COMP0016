The post-processing method involves submerging the porous prints in commercial ferrofluid (oil-based magnetic liquid), followed by drying under heat. The actuation of the chainmail has been simulated using a rigid multi-body physics engine, and qualitatively matches experiment. Such magnetically actuating fabrics have potential to make thin, lightweight and comfortable wearable assistive devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "magnetic"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Biomedical applications", "Functionalized", "magnetic", "Magnetic liquids", "Physics engine", "Postprocessing methods", "Wearable assistive devices"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065516057", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"23061226900": {"Name": "Ploszajski A.", "AuthorID": "23061226900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}, "57155266600": {"Name": "Jackson R.", "AuthorID": "57155266600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}, "57195277560": {"Name": "Ransley M.", "AuthorID": "57195277560", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}, "55827028600": {"Name": "Miodownik M.", "AuthorID": "55827028600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}}}
