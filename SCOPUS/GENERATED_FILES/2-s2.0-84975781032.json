Yet, no specific PROM exists for the large and diverse mental health supported accommodation sector. We aimed to produce and validate a PROM specifically for supported accommodation services, by adapting the Client's Assessment of Treatment Scale (CAT) and assessing its psychometric properties in a large sample. Methods: Focus groups with service users in the three main types of mental health supported accommodation services in the United Kingdom (residential care, supported housing and floating outreach) were conducted to adapt the contents of the original CAT items and assess the acceptability of the modified scale (CAT-SA). The CAT-SA was then administered in a survey to service users across England. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent validity was tested through correlations with subjective quality of life and satisfaction with accommodation, as measured by the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). Results: All seven original items of the CAT were regarded as relevant to appraisals of mental health supported accommodation services, with only slight modifications to the wording required. In the survey, data were obtained from 618 clients. The internal consistency of the CAT-SA items was 0.89. Mean CAT-SA scores were correlated with the specific accommodation item on the MANSA (r s = 0.37, p<.001). Conclusions: The content of the CAT-SA has relevance to service users living in mental health supported accommodation. The findings from our large survey show that the CAT-SA is acceptable across different types of supported accommodation and suggest good psychometric properties. The CAT-SA appears a valid and easy to use PROM for service users in mental health supported accommodation services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mental Health", "Patient Reported Outcome", "Supported Accommodation", "Treatment Satisfaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Community Mental Health Services", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Patient Satisfaction", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Health Care", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975781032", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37077978100": {"Name": "Sandhu S.", "AuthorID": "37077978100", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159384", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Newham Centre for Mental Health, Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Services Development"}, "56909619300": {"Name": "Priebe S.", "AuthorID": "56909619300", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159384", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Newham Centre for Mental Health, Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Services Development"}, "6602601081": {"Name": "Killaspy H.", "AuthorID": "6602601081", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "55628773900": {"Name": "Krotofil J.", "AuthorID": "55628773900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "57188820603": {"Name": "McPherson P.", "AuthorID": "57188820603", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "23090615200": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "23090615200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "57188807231": {"Name": "Dowling S.", "AuthorID": "57188807231", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "36185124100": {"Name": "Arbuthnott M.", "AuthorID": "36185124100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, North London Service User Research Forum"}, "56581326100": {"Name": "Curtis S.", "AuthorID": "56581326100", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Durham University, Department of Geography"}, "57213716994": {"Name": "Leavey G.", "AuthorID": "57213716994", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Ulster University, Bamford Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing, School of Psychology"}, "7202810889": {"Name": "Shepherd G.", "AuthorID": "7202810889", "AffiliationID": "105780283", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mental Health"}}}
