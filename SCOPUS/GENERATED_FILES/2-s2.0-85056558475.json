In cases of underperformance, hindsight knowledge indicates forewarning being potentially available in terms of concerns, signs, or signals. It is not known how the physicians involved perceive such signals. Purpose: To openly explore how physicians perceive soft signals and react on them. Methods: In-depth interviews with 12 hospital-based physicians from various specialties and institutions following the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. Results: Physicians perceive soft signals as an observable deviation from a colleague's normal behavior, appearance, or communication. Once observed, they evaluate the signal by reflecting on it personally and/or by consulting others, resulting in either an active (i.e., speaking up) or passive (i.e., avoidance) reaction. Observer sensitivity, closeness to the peer, and cohesion of the physician group influence this observation-evaluation-reaction process. Conclusions and Implications: Physicians perceive soft signals as indicators of well-being and collegiality, not as concerns about performance or patient safety. They feel it is their responsibility to be sensitive to and deal with expressed signals. Creating a psychological safe culture could foster such an environment. Because a threat to physicians' well-being may indirectly affect their professional performance, soft signals require serious follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collegiality", "Patient safety", "Performance improvement", "Physician performance", "Physician well-being", "Psychological safety", "Quality improvement", "Safety culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Safety", "Peer Review, Health Care", "Physicians"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056558475", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57204643016": {"Name": "Van Den Goor M.", "AuthorID": "57204643016", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Professional Performance Research Group, Center for Evidence-Based Education, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "56922277800": {"Name": "Silkens M.", "AuthorID": "56922277800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Professional Performance Research Group, Center for Evidence-Based Education, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7004011554": {"Name": "Heineman M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004011554", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Professional Performance Research Group, Center for Evidence-Based Education, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "6507621988": {"Name": "Lombarts K.", "AuthorID": "6507621988", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Professional Performance Research Group, Center for Evidence-Based Education, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}}}
