Trauma triggers the attachment system. As John Bowlby pointed out, it inhibits exploration and activates affectional bonds. Brain studies and fossil records suggest that self-awareness most likely evolved in order to aid other awareness. Closely associated with evolutionary changes in social intelligence were changes in human brain structure. There was a modest proportional expansion (about 10%) in parts of the prefrontal cortex, with an increased richness of interconnections between neurones in these areas. The neurobiology of attachment is fairly well understood. In brief it seems that changes in attachment behaviour, such as falling in love, which are stimulated by social/sexual activity, entails the activation of an oxytocin and vasopressin sensitive circuit within the anterior hypothalamus (MPOA) linked to the VTA and the nucleus accumbens shell.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073852271", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University Collage London"}}}
