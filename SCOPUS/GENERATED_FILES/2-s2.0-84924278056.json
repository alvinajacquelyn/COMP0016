Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: Breakpoints of chromosomal abnormalities facilitate identification of novel candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide significant evidence supports the linkage between chromosome 17q25.3 and bipolar disorder (BD). Co-segregation of translocation t(9;17)(q33.2;q25.3) with psychiatric disorders has been reported. We aimed to narrow down these chromosomal breakpoint regions and to investigate the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms within these regions and BD as well as schizophrenia (SZ) in large genome-wide association study samples. Methods: We cross-linked Danish psychiatric and cytogenetic case registers to identify an individual with both t(9;17)(q33.2;q25.3) and BD. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was employed to map the chromosomal breakpoint regions of this proband. We accessed the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium BD (n = 16,731) and SZ (n = 21,856) data. Genetic associations between these disorders and single nucleotide polymorphisms within these breakpoint regions were analysed by BioQ, FORGE, and RegulomeDB programmes. Results: Four protein-coding genes [coding for (endonuclease V (ENDOV), neuronal pentraxin I (NPTX1), ring finger protein 213 (RNF213), and regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (RPTOR)] were found to be located within the 17q25.3 breakpoint region. NPTX1 was significantly associated with BD (p = 0.004), while ENDOV was significantly associated with SZ (p = 0.0075) after Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: Prior linkage evidence and our findings suggest NPTX1 as a novel candidate gene for BD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bipolar disorder", "Genetic association studies", "Genetic translocation", "NPTX1", "RPTOR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Bipolar Disorder", "C-Reactive Protein", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9", "Deoxyribonuclease (Pyrimidine Dimer)", "Family", "Genetic Linkage", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Schizophrenia", "Translocation, Genetic", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924278056", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"16242385200": {"Name": "Rajkumar A.P.", "AuthorID": "16242385200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Sequencing, iSEQ, Aarhus University"}, "35315516700": {"Name": "Christensen J.H.", "AuthorID": "35315516700", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Sequencing, iSEQ, Aarhus University"}, "8636730800": {"Name": "Mattheisen M.", "AuthorID": "8636730800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Sequencing, iSEQ, Aarhus University"}, "35798589400": {"Name": "Pallesen J.", "AuthorID": "35798589400", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Sequencing, iSEQ, Aarhus University"}, "57220499322": {"Name": "Grove J.", "AuthorID": "57220499322", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Research Centre (BiRC), Aarhus University"}, "57196658116": {"Name": "Qvist P.", "AuthorID": "57196658116", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Sequencing, iSEQ, Aarhus University"}, "7004609664": {"Name": "B\u00f8rglum A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004609664", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department P, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "55848136300": {"Name": "Jacobsen I.", "AuthorID": "55848136300", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "7004006411": {"Name": "Mors O.", "AuthorID": "7004006411", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department P, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "12243546800": {"Name": "Bache I.", "AuthorID": "12243546800", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelm Johannsen Centre for Functional Genome Research, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, University of Copenhagen"}, "57200009218": {"Name": "Mcquillin A.", "AuthorID": "57200009218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7005726887": {"Name": "Gurling H.M.", "AuthorID": "7005726887", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7004511379": {"Name": "T\u00fcmer Z.", "AuthorID": "7004511379", "AffiliationID": "60006564, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Applied Molecular Genetics, Kennedy Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"}}}
