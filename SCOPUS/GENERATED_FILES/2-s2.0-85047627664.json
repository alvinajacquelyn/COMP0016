Thus, it can provide absolute CBF quantification, which eliminates the need for the contrast agent, and can be performed repeatedly. This review will focus on the common ASL acquisition techniques (continuous, pulsed, and pseudocontinuous ASL) and how ASL image quality might be affected by intrinsic factors that may bias the CBF measurements. We also provide suggestions to mitigate these risks, model appropriately the acquired signal, increase the image quality, and hence estimate the reliability of the CBF, which consists an important noninvasive biomarker. Emerging methodologies for extraction of new ASL-based biomarkers, such as arterial arrival time (AAT) and arterial blood volume (aBV), will be also briefly discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Arteries", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Perfusion Imaging", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047627664", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57202248460": {"Name": "Alsaedi A.", "AuthorID": "57202248460", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology Technology, Taibah University"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
