Aims To develop a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) manual for anxiety in dementia and determine its feasibility through a randomised controlled trial. Method A ten-session CBT manual was developed. Participants with dementia and anxiety (and their carers) were randomly allocated to CBT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25) or TAU (n = 25). Outcome and cost measures were administered at baseline, 15 weeks and 6 months. Results At 15 weeks, there was an adjusted difference in anxiety (using the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale) of (73.10, 95% CI 76.55 to 0.34) for CBT compared with TAU, which just fell short of statistical significance. There were significant improvements in depression at 15 weeks after adjustment (75.37, 95% CI 79.50 to 71.25). Improvements remained significant at 6 months. CBT was cost neutral. Conclusions CBT was feasible (in terms of recruitment, acceptability and attrition) and effective. A fully powered RCT is now required.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cognitive Therapy", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "Dementia", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Single-Blind Method", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932160898", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7403886623": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "7403886623", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55418727100": {"Name": "Lattimer M.", "AuthorID": "55418727100", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Goodmayes Hospital"}, "7004155892": {"Name": "Qazi A.", "AuthorID": "7004155892", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Goodmayes Hospital"}, "35765796900": {"Name": "Sadek S.", "AuthorID": "35765796900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology, University of East Anglia"}, "6603627308": {"Name": "Marston L.", "AuthorID": "6603627308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "56586242200": {"Name": "Rehill A.", "AuthorID": "56586242200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7202388606": {"Name": "Knapp M.", "AuthorID": "7202388606", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "6603687595": {"Name": "Hoe J.", "AuthorID": "6603687595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health Sciences, University College London"}}}
