All rights reserved.High resolution serial block-face scanning electron microscopy has been performed on sintered micro-silver pastes that are used as lead replacement joints for die bonding. The size and spatial distributions of the porosity before and after ageing were determined by quantification of the segmented 3D images. The elastic modulus was determined by an image-based finite element model and validated by results obtained from a dynamical resonance method. In agreement with contemporary analytical models on the elastic behaviour of porous materials, the elastic modulus was found to be a function of pore fraction only. Ageing the specimens does not alter the density or Young's modulus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron microscopy", "Finite element method", "Micromechanics", "Microstructural evolution", "Sintered joint", "Tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Elastic behaviour", "High resolution", "Image-based finite element modeling", "Lead-replacement", "Quantitative characterization", "Resonance methods", "Sintered joint", "Young's Modulus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930944034", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55503114300": {"Name": "Carr J.", "AuthorID": "55503114300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "56067694300": {"Name": "Thompson G.E.", "AuthorID": "56067694300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "6603017581": {"Name": "Milhet X.", "AuthorID": "6603017581", "AffiliationID": "60032653, 60009701", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pprime, UPR CNRS 3346, ENSMA - Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers"}, "6603060005": {"Name": "Gadaud P.", "AuthorID": "6603060005", "AffiliationID": "60032653, 60009701", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pprime, UPR CNRS 3346, ENSMA - Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers"}, "7103122708": {"Name": "Boyer S.A.E.", "AuthorID": "7103122708", "AffiliationID": "60032653, 60009701", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pprime, UPR CNRS 3346, ENSMA - Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers"}}}
