A systematic increase in reactor capacity was achieved by increasing individual dimensions of the rectangular and hexagonal channels, where lens-shaped polyvinyl alcohol particles were either uniformly or randomly distributed. Evaluation of reactors with volumes ranging from a few \u03bcL up to several mL revealed the benefit of using a single layer of particles packed between two plates forming a wide channel with triangular inlet and outlet parts containing pillars, where very high production rates and biocatalyst accessibility were achieved. MPBR was also used to establish temperature dependence of the immobilized \u03c9-transaminase yielding 55 \u00b0C as an optimal temperature. More than 80% of the initial productivity was retained after 21 days of continuous operation of the MPBR at 24 \u00b0C, suggesting a high operational stability. The miniaturized reactor developed in this study was found to be very efficient for \u03c9-transaminases-catalyzed chiral amine process development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biocatalysis", "Immobilization", "Miniaturization", "Omega-transaminase", "Packed bed", "Scale-up"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biocatalysis", "Continuous enzymatic process", "Individual dimensions", "Miniaturization", "Omega-transaminases", "Operational stability", "Scale-up", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995674848", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57191985055": {"Name": "Baji\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57191985055", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "6602713537": {"Name": "Plazl I.", "AuthorID": "6602713537", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "11539631400": {"Name": "\u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d-Plazl P.", "AuthorID": "11539631400", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "6507115594": {"Name": "Stloukal R.", "AuthorID": "6507115594", "AffiliationID": "115252194", "AffiliationName": "LentiKat's a.s."}}}
