Recent electrophysiological studies, however, indicate that eye position gain fields may serve an additional function since they have a non-uniform spatial distribution that increases the neural response to stimuli in the straight-ahead direction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a wide-field stimulus display to determine whether gaze modulations in early human visual cortex enhance the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) response to stimuli that are straight-ahead. Subjects viewed rotating polar angle wedge stimuli centered straight-ahead or vertically displaced by \u00b120\u00b0 eccentricity. Gaze position did not affect the topography of polar phase-angle maps, confirming that coding was retinotopic, but did affect the amplitude of the BOLD response, consistent with a gain field. In agreement with recent electrophysiological studies, BOLD responses in V1 and V2 to a wedge stimulus at a fixed retinal locus decreased when the wedge location in head-centered coordinates was farther from the straight-ahead direction. We conclude that stimulus-evoked BOLD signals are modulated by a systematic, non-uniform distribution of eye-position gain fields.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gain field", "Gaze", "Retinotopy", "Vertical meridian", "Wide-field"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Eye", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940582234", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"37103106200": {"Name": "Strappini F.", "AuthorID": "37103106200", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology Department, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "7003824365": {"Name": "Corbetta M.", "AuthorID": "7003824365", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7102613906": {"Name": "Shulman G.", "AuthorID": "7102613906", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University, School of Medicine"}, "6602749229": {"Name": "Pitzalis S.", "AuthorID": "6602749229", "AffiliationID": "60018048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Motor, Human and Health Sciences, University of Rome \u201cForo Italico\u201d"}, "35548911400": {"Name": "Snyder A.", "AuthorID": "35548911400", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Washington University, School of Medicine"}, "6701836166": {"Name": "McAvoy M.", "AuthorID": "6701836166", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Washington University, School of Medicine"}, "7005050489": {"Name": "Sereno M.", "AuthorID": "7005050489", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck-UCL Centre for NeuroImaging"}}}
