All rights reserved.The World Federation of Hemophilia and the National Hemophilia Foundation encourage people with haemophilia (PWH) to participate in routine physical activity. The benefits of physical activity for PWH include improvements in joint, bone, and muscle health. Accordingly, a number of studies suggestthat levelsofphysicalactivityamong PWH aresimilar to those of their healthy peers, especially among individuals who began prophylaxis at an early age (\u2264 3 years). Importantly, several studies found either no increased risk or only a transient increase in risk of bleeding with more intensive physical activity compared with less intensive physical activity. Data on optimal prophylaxis regimens for PWH who participateinphysical/sporting activities; however, remain sparse. Long-acting recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) demonstrated efficacy for the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in Phase 3 clinical trials of participants with haemophilia A and B, respectively, with most individuals able to maintain or increase their physical activities. This manuscript reviews the current literature that describes physical activity in PWH. Additionally, case studies are presented to provide supplemental information to clinicians illustrating the use of rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc in physically active patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively. These case reports demonstrate that it is possible for patients to be physically active and maintain good control of their haemophilia with extended interval prophylactic dosing using rFVIIIFc or rFIXFc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Factor IX", "Factor VIII", "Fusion protein", "Haemophilia A", "Haemophilia B", "Physical activity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exercise", "Factor IX", "Factor VIII", "Hemophilia A", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028242783", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"56027805200": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "56027805200", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center"}, "6508073691": {"Name": "Alvarez-Rom\u00e1n M.T.", "AuthorID": "6508073691", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario La Paz"}, "57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia Centre, Thrombosis Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "54888383000": {"Name": "Quon D.V.", "AuthorID": "54888383000", "AffiliationID": "114889273", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Hemophilia Treatment Center"}, "57193063745": {"Name": "Schafer K.", "AuthorID": "57193063745", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California Davis"}}}
