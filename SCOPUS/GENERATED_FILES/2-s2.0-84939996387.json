The compressibility, the particle breakage and the associated change in particle shape were examined in the sands with and without reinforcement. Each reconstituted sand was found to have a unique normal compression line. The compressibility increased with increasing uniformity and with larger mean diameters, thus coarse uniform sands were found to be the most compressible. They also underwent more breakage of particles, which was more significant in the weaker carbonate sands. At the grain scale, the addition of fibres seemed to reduce the amount of particle breakage in the soil, more significantly in well-graded sands. A unique NCL was found for each fibre-reinforced sand, parallel to that of the corresponding non-reinforced sand. A strong correlation was found between the ability of the fibres to prevent particle breakage and their ability to limit changes in particle shape.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compression", "Fibre-reinforced sand", "Particle breakage", "Particle shape", "Particle size distribution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compression line", "Fibre reinforced", "One-dimensional compressions", "Particle breakage", "Particle shape", "Reinforced sand", "Strong correlation", "Well graded sand"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939996387", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"56565573400": {"Name": "Miranda Pino L.", "AuthorID": "56565573400", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}, "15841467600": {"Name": "Baudet B.", "AuthorID": "15841467600", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}}}
