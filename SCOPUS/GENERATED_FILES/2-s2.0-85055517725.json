Alzheimers Dis.", "Volume": "62", "Issue": 4, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1857, "PageEnd": 1863, "CitedBy": 38, "DOI": "10.3233/JAD-170784", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055517725&origin=inward", "Abstract": "The 42 amino acid form of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a core biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. Numerous studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 concentrations are decreased in AD, when measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and other conventional immunoassays. While most studies report no change in plasma A\u03b242, independent studies using the immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technique report an increase in plasma A\u03b242 levels in AD. To confirm the opposite changes of A\u03b242 levels in CSF and plasma for AD, we assayed the levels of A\u03b242 in plasma of subjects with known CSF A\u03b242 levels. In total 43 controls and 63 AD patients were selected at two sites: the VU University Medical Center (n = 55) and Sahlgrenska University Hospital (n = 51). IMR and ELISA were applied to assay A\u03b242 in plasma and CSF, respectively. We found a moderately negative correlation between plasma and CSF A\u03b242 levels in AD patients (r = -0.352), and a weakly positive correlation in controls (r = 0.186). These findings further corroborate that there are opposite changes of A\u03b242 levels in CSF and plasma in AD. The possible causes for the negative correlation are discussed by taken assay technologies, A\u03b242 transport from brain to peripheral blood, and sample matrix into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid-\u03b2", "cerebrospinal fluid", "immunomagnetic reduction", "plasma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055517725", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57210241893": {"Name": "Teunissen C.", "AuthorID": "57210241893", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Neurochemistry Laboratory and Biobank, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam"}, "7101865593": {"Name": "Chiu M.", "AuthorID": "7101865593", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National Taiwan University"}, "7407734790": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "7407734790", "AffiliationID": "60095842", "AffiliationName": "MagQu Co., Ltd."}, "57195363326": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "57195363326", "AffiliationID": "60095842", "AffiliationName": "MagQu Co., Ltd."}, "57204745168": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "57204745168", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Alzheimer's Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam Neuroscience"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "120590429", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}}}
