The resistivity of the materials was assessed as pressed heat-treated pellets, revealing that the sample with the lowest resistivity (3.5 \u00d7 10-2 \u03a9 cm) was the 0.25 at% Si doped ZnO sample. The synthesis of this optimum composition was then scaled up to 350 g h-1 using a larger pilot plant CHFS process. Spin coating of a slurry of the resulting nanopowder made on the pilot plant, followed by an appropriate heat-treatment, produced a thin film with an optical transmission >80% and a low resistivity of 2.4 \u00d7 10-3 \u03a9 cm, with a carrier concentration of 1.02 \u00d7 1020 cm-3 and a mobility of 11 cm2 V-1 s-1. This is a factor of almost twenty times improvement in the resistivity versus the analogous pressed, heat-treated pellet.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Doped zinc oxides", "Low resistivity", "Optimisations", "Optimum composition", "Production rates", "Thin-film depositions", "Transparent conducting oxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028772268", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57190813721": {"Name": "Howard D.", "AuthorID": "57190813721", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55243347800": {"Name": "Marchand P.", "AuthorID": "55243347800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
