Here we consider the practical trade-offs policy makers and practitioners must navigate when utilizing the concept of well-being in environmental interventions. We first review current concepts of well-being before considering the need to balance the complexity and practical applicability of the definition used and to consider both positive and negative components of well-being. A key determinant of how well-being is operationalized is the identity of the organization wishing to monitor it. We describe the trade-offs around the external and internal validity of different approaches to measuring well-being and the relative contributions of qualitative and quantitative information to understanding well-being. We explore how these trade-offs may be decided as a result of a power struggle between stakeholders. Well-being is a complex, multi-dimensional, dynamic concept that cannot be easily defined and measured. Local perspectives are often missed during the project design process as a result of the more powerful voices of national governments and international NGOs, so for equity and local relevance it is important to ensure these perspectives are represented at a high level in project design and implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conservation", "evaluation", "happiness", "monitoring", "validity", "well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945311189", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"35079177800": {"Name": "Palmer Fry B.", "AuthorID": "35079177800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Policy, Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7003731704": {"Name": "Milner-Gulland E.", "AuthorID": "7003731704", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Policy, Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55998838300": {"Name": "Agarwala M.", "AuthorID": "55998838300", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment Department, London School of Economics"}, "7102995230": {"Name": "Atkinson G.", "AuthorID": "7102995230", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment Department, London School of Economics"}, "57211840242": {"Name": "Mourato S.", "AuthorID": "57211840242", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment Department, London School of Economics"}, "7003329682": {"Name": "Clements T.", "AuthorID": "7003329682", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society"}, "56056178500": {"Name": "Homewood K.", "AuthorID": "56056178500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Anthropology Department, University College London"}, "6701682562": {"Name": "Rowcliffe J.", "AuthorID": "6701682562", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "55279913500": {"Name": "Wallace G.", "AuthorID": "55279913500", "AffiliationID": "60071580", "AffiliationName": "Frankfurt Zoological Society"}}}
