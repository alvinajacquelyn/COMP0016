Due to this abundance of information, systems to find and recommend appropriate information for children are needed. Recommender systems (RS) for children have only recently begun to be researched. This area of research brings together researchers in education, child-development, computer scientists, designers, and more who address several issues including those related to education, algorithms, ethics, privacy, security. In this workshop we will: discuss and identify issues related to RS designed for children including challenges and limitations, discuss possible solutions to the identified challenges and plan for future research, and of critical importance work to build a community that explicitly looks at these critical issues. This workshop has a specific theme of educationally-related recommendations, but welcomes other child-oriented recommender system contributions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Design", "Ethics", "Evaluation", "Recommender systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child development", "Children", "Computer scientists", "Critical issues", "Ethics", "Evaluation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051464563", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"8359649800": {"Name": "Fails J.", "AuthorID": "8359649800", "AffiliationID": "60001456", "AffiliationName": "Boise State University"}, "23398088300": {"Name": "Pera M.", "AuthorID": "23398088300", "AffiliationID": "60001456", "AffiliationName": "Boise State University"}, "54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6701572830": {"Name": "Garzotto F.", "AuthorID": "6701572830", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Milano"}}}
