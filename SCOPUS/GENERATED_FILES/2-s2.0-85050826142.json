Current X-ray detector sensitivities are limited by the bulk X-ray attenuation of the materials and consequently necessitate thick crystals (~1 mm\u20131 cm), resulting in rigid structures, high operational voltages and high cost. Here we present a disruptive, flexible, low cost, broadband, and high sensitivity direct X-ray transduction technology produced by embedding high atomic number bismuth oxide nanoparticles in an organic bulk heterojunction. These hybrid detectors demonstrate sensitivities of 1712 \u00b5C mGy\u22121 cm\u22123 for \u201csoft\u201d X-rays and ~30 and 58 \u00b5C mGy\u22121 cm\u22123 under 6 and 15 MV \u201chard\u201d X-rays generated from a medical linear accelerator; strongly competing with the current solid state detectors, all achieved at low bias voltages (\u221210 V) and low power, enabling detector operation powered by coin cell batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050826142", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57190378711": {"Name": "Thirimanne H.M.", "AuthorID": "57190378711", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "36349379900": {"Name": "Jayawardena K.D.G.I.", "AuthorID": "36349379900", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "57203167709": {"Name": "Bandara R.M.I.", "AuthorID": "57203167709", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "57203171026": {"Name": "Karalasingam A.", "AuthorID": "57203171026", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "57202566890": {"Name": "Mills C.A.", "AuthorID": "57202566890", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "7203043276": {"Name": "Silva S.R.P.", "AuthorID": "7203043276", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "7003960922": {"Name": "Parnell A.J.", "AuthorID": "7003960922", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "7006250177": {"Name": "Lidzey D.G.", "AuthorID": "7006250177", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "56186091400": {"Name": "Pani S.", "AuthorID": "56186091400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203165942": {"Name": "Huerdler J.E.", "AuthorID": "57203165942", "AffiliationID": "60028673", "AffiliationName": "Siemens Healthineers GmbH, Technology Centre"}, "22235591000": {"Name": "Tedde S.F.", "AuthorID": "22235591000", "AffiliationID": "60028673", "AffiliationName": "Siemens Healthineers GmbH, Technology Centre"}}}
