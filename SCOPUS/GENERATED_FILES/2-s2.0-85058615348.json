The study reported focuses on students\u2019 agency in shaping institutional internationalization processes, in particular during their studies but also, as it became apparent, later in their teaching careers following graduation. Moreover, we explore how students\u2019 agency in internationalization is shaped by the conflict and its consequences. Employing a qualitative methodology, we followed six students\u2019 personal and professional trajectories, revealing the nature and scope of their activities and perceptions in light of their proactive role in internationalization in their institutions. We show how life in a conflict-ridden society may prompt proactivity and agency among marginalized students, revealing and discussing the potential transformative nature of students\u2019 agency in internationalization processes. Our findings indicate that institutions can strive to facilitate student agency and utilize it to further develop internationalization within their institutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency", "internationalization at home", "interviews", "Israel", "students"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058615348", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"35368688500": {"Name": "Goldstein O.", "AuthorID": "35368688500", "AffiliationID": "60093512", "AffiliationName": "Kaye Academic College of Education"}, "56347376600": {"Name": "Natur N.", "AuthorID": "56347376600", "AffiliationID": "112987806", "AffiliationName": "Al-Qasemi Academic College of Education"}, "24472129400": {"Name": "Trahar S.", "AuthorID": "24472129400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Tel Aviv University"}}}
