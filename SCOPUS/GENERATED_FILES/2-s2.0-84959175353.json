Objective: This study aimed to validate self-reported intake of fish, fruit and vegetables, and selected micronutrient intakes assessed by a web-based self-administered dietary record tool used in the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 prospective cohort study, against the following concentration biomarkers: plasma beta carotene, vitamin C, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Participants/setting: One hundred ninety-eight adult volunteers (103 men and 95 women, mean age=50.5 years) were included in the protocol: they completed 3 nonconsecutive-day dietary records and two blood samples were drawn 3 weeks apart. The study was conducted in the area of Paris, France, between October 2012 and May 2013. Main outcome measures: Reported fish, fruit and vegetables, and selected micronutrient intakes and plasma beta carotene, vitamin C, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were compared. Statistical analyses: Simple and adjusted Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were estimated after de-attenuation for intra-individual variation. Results: Regarding food groups in men, adjusted correlations ranged from 0.20 for vegetables and plasma vitamin C to 0.49 for fruits and plasma vitamin C, and from 0.40 for fish and plasma c20:5 n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) to 0.55 for fish and plasma c22:6 n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid). In women, correlations ranged from 0.13 (nonsignificant) for vegetables and plasma vitamin C to 0.41 for fruits and vegetables and plasma beta carotene, and from 0.27 for fatty fish and EPA to 0.54 for fish and EPA+docosahexaenoic acid. Regarding micronutrients, adjusted correlations ranged from 0.36 (EPA) to 0.58 (vitamin C) in men and from 0.32 (vitamin C) to 0.38 (EPA) in women. Conclusions: The findings suggest that three nonconsecutive web-based dietary records provide reasonable estimates of true intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, beta carotene, vitamin C, and n-3 fatty acids. Along with other validation studies, this study shows acceptable validity of using such diet-assessment methods in large epidemiologic surveys and broadens new perspectives for epidemiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary record", "Internet", "Plasma biomarkers", "Validation study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ascorbic Acid", "beta Carotene", "Biomarkers", "Body Mass Index", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Diet Records", "Energy Intake", "Fatty Acids, Omega-3", "Female", "Fishes", "France", "Fruit", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Micronutrients", "Middle Aged", "Nutrition Assessment", "Nutritional Status", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "Seafood", "Vegetables", "Vitamins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959175353", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"35798512000": {"Name": "Lassale C.", "AuthorID": "35798512000", "AffiliationID": "60112042", "AffiliationName": "Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Inserm U1153"}, "55929832600": {"Name": "Camilleri G.", "AuthorID": "55929832600", "AffiliationID": "60112042", "AffiliationName": "Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Inserm U1153"}, "35971822000": {"Name": "Faure P.", "AuthorID": "35971822000", "AffiliationID": "60005851, 60104653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University Hospital of Grenoble and head, HP2 Laboratory, University Grenoble Alpes, HP2 Laboratory"}, "56386887800": {"Name": "Hercberg S.", "AuthorID": "56386887800", "AffiliationID": "60008800", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, Avicenne Hospital"}, "36484310400": {"Name": "Galan P.", "AuthorID": "36484310400", "AffiliationID": "60112042", "AffiliationName": "Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Inserm U1153"}, "35573782000": {"Name": "Kesse-Guyot E.", "AuthorID": "35573782000", "AffiliationID": "60112042", "AffiliationName": "Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Inserm U1153"}, "6603767452": {"Name": "Castetbon K.", "AuthorID": "6603767452", "AffiliationID": "113184761", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit, French Institute for Health Surveillance"}, "6603383844": {"Name": "Deschamps V.", "AuthorID": "6603383844", "AffiliationID": "113184761", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit, French Institute for Health Surveillance"}, "35436444600": {"Name": "Vernay M.", "AuthorID": "35436444600", "AffiliationID": "113184761", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit, French Institute for Health Surveillance"}, "7003494763": {"Name": "Laporte F.", "AuthorID": "7003494763", "AffiliationID": "60005851, 60104653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University Hospital of Grenoble and head, HP2 Laboratory, University Grenoble Alpes, HP2 Laboratory"}}}
