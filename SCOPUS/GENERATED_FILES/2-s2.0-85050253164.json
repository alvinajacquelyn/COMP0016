We add interactive fixed effects in the form of a factor structure on the unobserved product characteristics. The interactive fixed effects can be arbitrarily correlated with the observed product characteristics (including price), which accommodate endogeneity and, at the same time, capture strong persistence in market shares across products and markets. We propose a two-step least squares-minimum distance (LS-MD) procedure to calculate the estimator. Our estimator is easy to compute, and Monte Carlo simulations show that it performs well. We consider an empirical illustration to US automobile demand.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrete-choice demand model", "Factor analysis", "Interactive fixed effects", "Panel data", "Random utility model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Demand modeling", "Factor structure", "Fixed effects", "Minimum distance", "Panel data", "Product characteristics", "Random coefficients", "Random utility model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050253164", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7402662461": {"Name": "Moon H.", "AuthorID": "7402662461", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Yonsei University"}, "6701814945": {"Name": "Shum M.", "AuthorID": "6701814945", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "55241495000": {"Name": "Weidner M.", "AuthorID": "55241495000", "AffiliationID": "60117041", "AffiliationName": "CeMMAP"}}}
