Resistance genes can mobilize via various mechanisms, including conjugation and transposition; however, the importance of this mobility in short-term evolution, such as within nosocomial outbreaks, is unknown. Using a combination of short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing of 281 blaKPC -positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a single hospital over 5 years, we demonstrate rapid dissemination of this carbapenem resistance gene to multiple species, strains, and plasmids. Mobility of blaKPC occurs at multiple nested genetic levels, with transmission of blaKPC strains between individuals, frequent transfer of blaKPC plasmids between strains/species, and frequent transposition of blaKPC transposon Tn4401 between plasmids. We also identify a common insertion site for Tn4401 within various Tn2-like elements, suggesting that homologous recombination between Tn2-like elements has enhanced the spread of Tn4401 between different plasmid vectors. Furthermore, while short-read sequencing has known limitations for plasmid assembly, various studies have attempted to overcome this by the use of reference-based methods. We also demonstrate that, as a consequence of the genetic mobility observed in this study, plasmid structures can be extremely dynamic, and therefore these reference-based methods, as well as traditional partial typing methods, can produce very misleading conclusions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that nonclonal resistance gene dissemination can be extremely rapid, presenting significant challenges for public health surveillance and achieving effective control of antibiotic resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Typing Techniques", "beta-Lactam Resistance", "beta-Lactamases", "Carbapenems", "Conjugation, Genetic", "DNA Transposable Elements", "Enterobacteriaceae", "Enterobacteriaceae Infections", "Gene Expression", "Gene Transfer, Horizontal", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Homologous Recombination", "Humans", "Phylogeny", "Plasmids", "Public Health Surveillance", "Tertiary Care Centers", "Virginia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973667755", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56428668100": {"Name": "Sheppard A.E.", "AuthorID": "56428668100", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "16242353500": {"Name": "Stoesser N.", "AuthorID": "16242353500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "57202955230": {"Name": "Wilson D.J.", "AuthorID": "57202955230", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "56368438000": {"Name": "Anson L.W.", "AuthorID": "56368438000", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "53663441600": {"Name": "Giess A.", "AuthorID": "53663441600", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, University of Bergen"}, "32367751700": {"Name": "Pankhurst L.J.", "AuthorID": "32367751700", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "36097031900": {"Name": "Vaughan A.", "AuthorID": "36097031900", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "7005772816": {"Name": "Peto T.E.", "AuthorID": "7005772816", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Modernizing Medical Microbiology Consortium, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University"}, "7102132600": {"Name": "Crook D.W.", "AuthorID": "7102132600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Microbiology Services"}, "6506130990": {"Name": "Sebra R.", "AuthorID": "6506130990", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Icahn Institute, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine"}, "7801322611": {"Name": "Kasarskis A.", "AuthorID": "7801322611", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Icahn Institute, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine"}, "15759434500": {"Name": "Grim C.J.", "AuthorID": "15759434500", "AffiliationID": "60010237", "AffiliationName": "Food and Drug Administration"}, "16834349900": {"Name": "Cox H.L.", "AuthorID": "16834349900", "AffiliationID": "60029418", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Health System"}, "55571752600": {"Name": "Yeh A.J.", "AuthorID": "55571752600", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Molecular Genetics Section, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"}, "6602330791": {"Name": "Sifri C.D.", "AuthorID": "6602330791", "AffiliationID": "60029418", "AffiliationName": "Office of Hospital Epidemiology, University of Virginia Health System"}, "15136276500": {"Name": "Mathers A.J.", "AuthorID": "15136276500", "AffiliationID": "60030846, 60029418", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Microbiology, Department of Pathology, University of Virginia Health System"}}}
