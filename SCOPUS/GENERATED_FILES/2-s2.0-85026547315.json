A significant range of microtextures, organic-matter particles and fracture styles was observed in rocks of the Lower Bowland shale, together with the underlying Pendleside Limestone and Worston Shale formations encountered the Preese Hall-1 Borehole, Lancashire, UK. Four micro-texture types were identified: unlaminated quartz-rich mudstone; interlaminated quartz- and pyrite-rich mudstone; laminated quartz and pyrite-rich mudstone; and weakly-interlaminated calcite-rich mudstone. Organic matter particles are classified into four types depending on their size, shape and location: multi-micrometre particles with and without macropores: micrometre-size particles in cement and between clay minerals; multi-micrometre layers; and organic matter in large pores. Fractures are categorized into carbonate-sealed fractures; bitumen-bearing fractures; resin-filled fractures; and empty fractures. We propose that during thermal maturation, horizontal bitumen-fractures were formed by overpressuring, stress relaxation, compaction and erosional offloading, whereas vertical bitumen-bearing, resin-filled and empty fractures may have been influenced by weak vertical joints generated during the previous period of veining. For the majority of samples, the high TOC (>2 wt%), low clay content (<20 wt%), high proportion of quartz (>50 wt%) and the presence of a multi-scale fracture network support the increasing interest in the Bowland Shale as a potentially exploitable oil and gas source. The microtextural observations made in this study highlight preliminary evidence of fluid passage or circulation in the Bowland Shale sequence during burial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bowland shale", "Characterization", "Fractures", "Micro-texture", "Microscopy", "Organic matter", "Variability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Filled fracture", "Fluid passage", "Fracture network", "Micro texture", "Shale formation", "Thermal maturation", "Total organic carbon content", "Variability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026547315", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Economic Geology", "EART", "1905"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"]], "AuthorData": {"54941201900": {"Name": "Fauchille A.L.", "AuthorID": "54941201900", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57203506990": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "57203506990", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester X-Ray Imaging Facility, School of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7005870973": {"Name": "Rutter E.", "AuthorID": "7005870973", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester"}, "56669367000": {"Name": "Chandler M.", "AuthorID": "56669367000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester"}, "35428783800": {"Name": "Taylor K.G.", "AuthorID": "35428783800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester"}}}
