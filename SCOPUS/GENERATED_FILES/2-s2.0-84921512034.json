Export is normally achieved by the Sec pathway, which transports proteins through the plasma membrane in a reduced, unfolded state. The Tat pathway is a promising alternative means of export, because it preferentially exports correctly folded proteins; however, the reducing cytoplasm of standard strains has been predicted to preclude export by Tat of proteins that contain disulfide bonds in the native state because, in the reduced state, they are sensed as misfolded and rejected. Here, we have tested a series of disulfide-bond containing biopharmaceuticals for export by the Tat pathway in CyDisCo strains that do enable disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. We show that interferon \u03b12b, human growth hormone (hGH) and two antibody fragments are exported with high efficiency; surprisingly, however, they are efficiently exported even in the absence of cytoplasmic disulfide formation. The exported proteins acquire disulfide bonds in the periplasm, indicating that the normal disulfide oxidation machinery is able to act on the proteins. Tat-dependent export of hGH proceeds even when the disulfide bonds are removed by substitution of the Cys residues involved, suggesting that these substrates adopt tertiary structures that are accepted as fully-folded by the Tat machinery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopharmaceuticals", "Cell engineering", "E. coli", "Protein export", "Tat pathway"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies", "Disulfides", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Human Growth Hormone", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fragments", "Interferon-alpha", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Organisms, Genetically Modified", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Periplasm", "Protein Transport", "Recombinant Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921512034", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7801441367": {"Name": "Alanen H.I.", "AuthorID": "7801441367", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu"}, "56489638800": {"Name": "Walker K.L.", "AuthorID": "56489638800", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "24460489000": {"Name": "Matos C.F.R.O.", "AuthorID": "24460489000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "56490774000": {"Name": "B\u00f6nisch S.", "AuthorID": "56490774000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "7403374944": {"Name": "Robinson C.", "AuthorID": "7403374944", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "56491044600": {"Name": "Lourdes Velez Suberbie M.", "AuthorID": "56491044600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701613219": {"Name": "Keshavarz-Moore E.", "AuthorID": "6701613219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202526898": {"Name": "Freedman R.B.", "AuthorID": "7202526898", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Gibbet Hill Campus, The University of Warwick"}, "13605555600": {"Name": "Ruddock L.W.", "AuthorID": "13605555600", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu"}}}
