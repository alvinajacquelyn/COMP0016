A significant improvement in photoemission, photocurrent density and spectral response was observed with post-growth annealing. The optimal anneal temperature was found to be 700\u00b0C, which lead to an 18% improvement in current density from 4.9 mA cm-2 for as-grown sample to 5.8 mA cm-2. We assign this enhanced performance to the reduced density of inherent point defects that was formed at the quantum dot (QD) and GaAs barrier. Post-growth thermal annealing of QDSCs is demonstrated as a simple route for achieving improved device performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anneal temperatures", "Device performance", "GaAs barriers", "Photocurrent density", "Postgrowth annealing", "Postgrowth thermal annealing", "Quantum dot solar cells", "Spectral response"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924953985", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55672258000": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "55672258000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56107909700": {"Name": "Hatch S.", "AuthorID": "56107909700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56593719300": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "56593719300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57212627155": {"Name": "Wilson J.", "AuthorID": "57212627155", "AffiliationID": "60026242", "AffiliationName": "Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Portsdown West"}, "41561028200": {"Name": "Allison R.", "AuthorID": "41561028200", "AffiliationID": "60026242", "AffiliationName": "Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Portsdown West"}}}
