To understand the patients\u2019 perspective of the medical process of receiving a cognitive assessment. This work is situated within the context of policy priorities for dementia diagnosis. Methods: Participants with and without dementia were recruited through NHS trusts and community organisations in four regional areas in England. Data were collected using longitudinal qualitative interviews. Transcript data were thematically analysed. Results: Sample of 41 people (mean 75 years, 25 dementia diagnoses). Interpretative thematic analyses focused on the presence or absence of trust in relational experiences. There were three transition points where trust could be specifically developed or undermined: (1) deciding to seek help; (2) healthcare practitioners\u2019 response to help-seeking; (3) process and outcome of assessment. Triggers for help-seeking for subjective cognitive concern were being prompted by family and knowing a relative with dementia. When participants perceived healthcare practitioners\u2019 behaviour as dismissive, they had less trust in the outcome of the healthcare encounter. Misunderstandings and absence of trust in assessment processes led to participants stating they did not fully agree with the outcomes of the assessment. Conclusions: Healthcare practitioners have an important role in supporting people with subjective cognitive concern ensuring patients have trust in assessment outcomes. Where the validity of the assessment process is seen as ambiguous, people can be left dealing with uncertainty, rather than being clear about ways they can manage their condition, situation or status.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive assessment", "dementia and cognitive disorders", "primary care", "qualitative methods", "screening and diagnosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063643729", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55778792500": {"Name": "Birt L.", "AuthorID": "55778792500", "AffiliationID": "60011775", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60011775", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56427480200": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "56427480200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "35726525300": {"Name": "Higgs P.", "AuthorID": "35726525300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
