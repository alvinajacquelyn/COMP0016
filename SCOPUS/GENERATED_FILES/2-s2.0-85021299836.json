Patients and Methods This was a prospective study involving 46 consecutive patients who were athletes with MRI-confirmed isolated PCL injuries presenting within four weeks of injury. All had Hughston grade II (25 athletes) or III (21 athletes) injuries. Our non-operative treatment regimen involved initial bracing, followed by an individualised rehabilitation programme determined by the symptoms and physical signs. The patients were reviewed until they had returned to sports-specific training, and were reviewed again at a mean of 5.2 years (3 to 9). Results The mean time to return to sports-specific training was 10.6 weeks and the mean time to return to full competitive sport was 16.4 weeks (10 to 40). A total of 42 patients (91.3%) were playing at the same or higher level of sport two years after the injury, with a mean Tegner activity score of 9 (5 to 10). At five years, 32 patients (69.5%) were playing at the same or higher level of sport, and 38 patients (82.6%) were playing at a competitive level, with a mean Tegner activity score of 9 (5 to 10). Conclusions Medium-term review of a series of athletes suggests that commencing the non-operative management of isolated, Hughston grade II and III PCL injuries within four weeks of injury gives excellent functional outcomes with a high proportion returning to the same or higher level of sport.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Athletic Injuries", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Knee Injuries", "Male", "Posterior Cruciate Ligament", "Prospective Studies", "Recovery of Function", "Return to Sport", "Time Factors", "Trauma Severity Indices", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021299836", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57193305753": {"Name": "Agolley D.", "AuthorID": "57193305753", "AffiliationID": "107472858", "AffiliationName": "John Flynn Private Hospital"}, "55210041500": {"Name": "Gabr A.", "AuthorID": "55210041500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department the University College of London Hospital"}, "36191637500": {"Name": "Benjamin-Laing H.", "AuthorID": "36191637500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department the University College of London Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College, London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
