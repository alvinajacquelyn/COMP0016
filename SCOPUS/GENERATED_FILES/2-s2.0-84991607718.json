The modulation bandwidth of the OLED device is limited to 310 kHz and the signal is generated on carrier frequencies fc = {100, 200, 300} kHz for use across different regions of the OLED frequency response. We demonstrate how setting a specific carrier frequency can affect the system performance. The supported bit rates are 220, 640 and 260 kb/s for fc = 100, 200 and 300 kHz, respectively. The angular dependence of the system performance is also analysed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bit error rate", "organic light emitting diode", "visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angular dependence", "Bit rates", "Carrier frequency", "Modulation bandwidth", "Organic LEDs", "Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991607718", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "57196454706": {"Name": "Dvorak P.", "AuthorID": "57196454706", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "56373334300": {"Name": "Pesek P.", "AuthorID": "56373334300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}}}
