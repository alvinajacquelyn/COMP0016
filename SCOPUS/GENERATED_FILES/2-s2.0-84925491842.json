In this investigation we suggest a novel means by which slow solidification may be monitored in Gelucire 44/14 using quasi-isothermal modulated temperature DSC (QiMTDSC). Methods: Conventional linear heating and cooling DSC methods were employed, along with hot stage microscopy (HSM), for basic thermal profiling of Gelucire 44/14. QiMTDSC experiments were performed on cooling from the melt, using a range of incremental decreases in temperature and isothermal measurement periods. Results: DSC and HSM highlighted the main (primary) crystallization transition; solid fat content analysis and kinetic analysis were used to profile the solidification process. The heat capacity profile from QiMTDSC indicated that after an initial energetic primary crystallisation, the lipid underwent a slower period of crystallization which continued to manifest at much lower temperatures than indicated by standard DSC. Conclusions: We present evidence that Gelucire 44/14 undergoes an initial crystallization followed by a secondary, slower process. QIMTDSC appears to be a promising tool in the investigation of this secondary crystallization process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crystallization", "Gelucire 44/14", "lipid", "Quasi-Isothermal MTDSC", "thermal analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calorimetry, Differential Scanning", "Crystallization", "Emulsions", "Excipients", "Kinetics", "Lipids", "Phase Transition", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Technology, Pharmaceutical", "Transition Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925491842", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56392895100": {"Name": "Otun S.O.", "AuthorID": "56392895100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy"}, "13409440100": {"Name": "Qi S.", "AuthorID": "13409440100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy"}, "7006752732": {"Name": "Meehan E.", "AuthorID": "7006752732", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Development, Medicines Development"}, "55428995000": {"Name": "Craig D.Q.M.", "AuthorID": "55428995000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
