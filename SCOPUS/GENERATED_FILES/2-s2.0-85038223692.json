A cross-sectional survey was conducted with: (i) general practitioners and obstetricians from a college database; and (ii) general practitioners with a special interest in Indigenous health. General practitioners had higher odds of prescribing compared to obstetricians. Reading guidelines, confidence, viewing nicotine replacement therapy as safe, effective and with good adherence, also significantly increased the odds of prescription. Clear guidance regarding safety and efficacy, with practical clinical protocols, are required in order to reduce variation in prescribing rates across these clinicians.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug therapy", "nicotine", "physicians", "pregnancy", "smoking cessation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "General Practitioners", "Humans", "Obstetrics", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Prenatal Care", "Smoking Cessation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tobacco Use Cessation Devices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038223692", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"15055169200": {"Name": "Bar-Zeev Y.", "AuthorID": "15055169200", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, The University of Newcastle"}, "6603014592": {"Name": "Bonevski B.", "AuthorID": "6603014592", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, The University of Newcastle"}, "55169749000": {"Name": "Twyman L.", "AuthorID": "55169749000", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, The University of Newcastle"}, "24471011800": {"Name": "Oldmeadow C.", "AuthorID": "24471011800", "AffiliationID": "60089816", "AffiliationName": "Hunter Medical Research Institute"}, "55342073200": {"Name": "Gould G.S.", "AuthorID": "55342073200", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, The University of Newcastle"}, "56154230700": {"Name": "Gruppetta M.", "AuthorID": "56154230700", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "Wollotuka Institute, The University of Newcastle"}, "7005842007": {"Name": "Atkins L.", "AuthorID": "7005842007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "6507070516": {"Name": "Palazzi K.", "AuthorID": "6507070516", "AffiliationID": "60089816", "AffiliationName": "Hunter Medical Research Institute"}}}
