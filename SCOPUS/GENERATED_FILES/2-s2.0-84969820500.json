Tight junctions form a semipermeable paracellular diffusion barrier and act as signalling hubs that guide cell behaviour and differentiation. Components of tight junctions are also expressed in cell types not forming tight junctions, such as cardiomyocytes, where they associate with facia adherens and/or gap junctions. This review will focus on tight junction proteins expressed and their importance in tissue homeostasis and remodelling with a particular emphasis on what we have learned from animal models and human diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Polarity", "Cytoplasm", "Humans", "Organ Specificity", "Tight Junction Proteins", "Tight Junctions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969820500", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7003313272": {"Name": "Balda M.", "AuthorID": "7003313272", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57196175685": {"Name": "Matter K.", "AuthorID": "57196175685", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
