Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper explores how distributed and relational forms of place-based leadership can be facilitated in environments with constrained local governance capabilities. It is based on an in-depth case study of a university-hosted collaborative platform situated in a city/regional institutional landscape marked by limited local devolution and public sector austerity. The research contributes to a fuller understanding of place-based leadership by analyzing how actors can mobilize interpretive and network forms of power outside formal governance structures to encourage long-term thinking and broker innovative cross-organizational projects. Equally, however, it highlights their continuing dependence on legitimating forms of local institutional and resource authority.", "AuthorKeywords": ["austerity", "devolution", "place leadership", "universities", "urban living partnership"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065082990", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"53867244600": {"Name": "Vallance P.", "AuthorID": "53867244600", "AffiliationID": "60116262", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Regional Economic and Enterprise Development (CREED), Sheffield University Management School, University of Sheffield"}, "7003292806": {"Name": "Tewdwr-Jones M.", "AuthorID": "7003292806", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape, Newcastle University"}, "56205634900": {"Name": "Kempton L.", "AuthorID": "56205634900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies (CURDS), Newcastle University"}}}
