Confirmative factor analysis and reliability and correlational analyses were conducted on a sample of 319 Catholic undergraduate students. Findings indicate that the Italian adaptation of the Religious Fundamentalism Scale, as a one-dimensional construct, represents a valid and reliable measure of religious fundamentalism. Furthermore, results highlight the positive role that religious fundamentalism plays in promoting life satisfaction and psychological well-being.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026904072", "SubjectAreas": [["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"41860964500": {"Name": "Carlucci L.", "AuthorID": "41860964500", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Laboratorio di Psicometria, University of G.
