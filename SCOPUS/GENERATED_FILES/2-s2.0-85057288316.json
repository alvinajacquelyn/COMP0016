Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Methods: Thirty-eight subjects at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London were assessed with 2 spectral-domain OCT\u2013derived ellipzoid zone (EZ) metrics with repeatability assessments. EZ width (EZW) measurements were made on transfoveal line scans. En face images of the EZ area (EZA) were generated from high-density macular volume scans and were quantified. Baseline size, progression rate, symmetry, associations with age and genotype, and baseline structure\u2013function correlation were investigated. Results: Baseline EZW and EZA measurements were 1963.6 \u03bcm and 3.70 mm2, respectively. The mean EZW progression rate was 233.6 \u03bcm per year, and the mean EZA rate was 0.67 mm2 per year. Relative interocular difference as an index of symmetry was 3% for both metrics, indicating good baseline symmetry in general\u2014although significant variation existed across the cohort. Analysis of variance found a significant effect of age but not genotype on EZ dimension and progression rates. Larger EZ dimension and greater progression were seen in younger subjects. A positive correlation between EZ dimension and progression was evident. Overall exponential decline rates of 8.2% with EZW and 15.5% with EZA were obtained. Good functional correlation was found with EZW demonstrating stronger correlation; however, EZA correlation with function was also significant. Conclusions: EZ metrics are sensitive structural biomarkers for measuring residual extent and progression in RPGR-associated retinopathy. Our elucidation of the natural history will provide clinicians and patients with more knowledge about the condition and inform the design and interpretation of interventional trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Progression", "Exons", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Open Reading Frames", "Prospective Studies", "Retina", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Field Tests", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057288316", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57114777600": {"Name": "Tee J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "57114777600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57202039648": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57202039648", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "36490013200": {"Name": "Kalitzeos A.", "AuthorID": "36490013200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005169657": {"Name": "Bainbridge J.", "AuthorID": "7005169657", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
