By contrast little is understood about how the brain represents future goal locations or computes the distance and direction to such goals. Recent electrophysiology, computational modelling and neuroimaging research have shed new light on how the spatial relationship to a goal may be determined and represented during navigation. This research suggests that the hippocampus may code the path to the goal while the entorhinal cortex represents the vector to the goal. It also reveals that the engagement of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex varies across the different operational stages of navigation, such as during travel, route planning, and decision-making at waypoints.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920079466", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "122410328", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}, "13405610800": {"Name": "Barry C.", "AuthorID": "13405610800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology"}}}
