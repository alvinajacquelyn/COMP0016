Geo: Geography and Environment published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).In January 2016, after two years of international negotiations, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into effect. The SDGs are the successors to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and represent an ambitious but potentially flawed agenda for sustainable development through to 2030. This review assesses the legacy of the MDGs, the development of the SDGs, and the international framework to put the SDGs into practice. We propose dividing the framework for SDG delivery into three key areas: implementing the goals and the SDG agenda (Implementation); monitoring, evaluation, and review (Monitoring); and increasing and improving global finance flows for sustainable development (Finance). This review identifies the challenges faced by the international community for making the SDGs an effective platform for equitable and sustainable development across these three areas. Proposed approaches and solutions are discussed and further research is suggested. This review concludes that further critical attention to the \u201cImplementation\u201d, \u201cMonitoring\u201d, and \u201cFinance\u201d framework is vital to ensure accountability and transparency from an ever-growing number of state and non-state development actors. This review also seeks to further the potential for greater links between development theory, development geography, and development actors and institutions to improve development under the SDGs and increase engagement from geography on the SDGs. This framework points towards a basis for critical engagement on the sustainability, equality, and quality of development, while challenging the primacy of economic growth-based paradigms in SDG implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["development finance", "governance for sustainable development", "indicators", "monitoring and evaluation", "Sustainable Development Goals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049510268", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56426548000": {"Name": "Georgeson L.", "AuthorID": "56426548000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7003590340": {"Name": "Maslin M.", "AuthorID": "7003590340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
