Trichomonas gallinae was isolated from (1) finches and rock pigeons (Columbia livia) submitted for post-mortem or live-captured at bird feeding sites experiencing trichomonosis mortality; (2) bird seed at these same sites; and (3) rock pigeons live-captured at known roosts or humanely killed. Isolates were characterized using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and iron hydrogenase (Fe-hyd) gene sequences. Two distinct ITS types were found. Type A was identical to the UK finch epidemic strain and was isolated from finches and a rock pigeon with trichomonosis; apparently healthy rock pigeons and finches; and bird seed at an outbreak site. Type B was obtained from apparently healthy rock pigeons. Fe-hyd sequencing revealed six distinct subtypes. The predominant subtype in both finches and the rock pigeon with trichomonosis was identical to the UK finch epidemic strain A1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Fe-hyd sequences suggest there is fine-scale variation amongst isolates and that finch trichomonosis emergence in this region may not have been caused by a single spill-over event.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fe-hydrogenase", "finch", "genotype", "ITS", "pigeon", "subtype", "Trichomonas gallinae", "trichomonosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "Bird Diseases", "Canada", "Columbidae", "DNA, Protozoan", "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer", "Epidemics", "Finches", "Genotype", "Hydrogenase", "Iron-Sulfur Proteins", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phylogeny", "Protozoan Proteins", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Trichomonas", "Trichomonas Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930160037", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6602766414": {"Name": "McBurney S.", "AuthorID": "6602766414", "AffiliationID": "60005845, 60007655", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, Atlantic Region, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island"}, "56001379400": {"Name": "Kelly-Clark W.K.", "AuthorID": "56001379400", "AffiliationID": "60005845, 60007655", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, Atlantic Region, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island"}, "8614129700": {"Name": "Forz\u00e1n M.J.", "AuthorID": "8614129700", "AffiliationID": "60005845, 60007655", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, Atlantic Region, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island"}, "8944571900": {"Name": "Lawson B.", "AuthorID": "8944571900", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7101627447": {"Name": "Tyler K.M.", "AuthorID": "7101627447", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "7004864321": {"Name": "Greenwood S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004864321", "AffiliationID": "60005845, 60007655", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island"}}}
