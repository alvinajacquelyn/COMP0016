We aimed to investigate their role in Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA expression was 13.0-fold (P=0.012) and 5.1-fold (P=0.038) higher in endomyocardial biopsies from patients with CVB3-positive myocarditis compared with controls, respectively. Elimination of CVB3 led to a downregulation of these alarmins. CVB3-infected mice developed an impaired left ventricular function and displayed an increased left ventricular S100A8 and S100A9 protein expression versus controls. In contrast, CVB3-infected S100A9 knockout mice, which are also a complete knockout for S100A8 on protein level, showed an improved left ventricular function, which was associated with a reduced cardiac inflammatory and oxidative response, and lower CVB3 copy number compared with wild-type CVB3 mice. Exogenous application of S100A8 to S100A9 knockout CVB3 mice induced a severe myocarditis similar to wild-type CVB3 mice. In CVB3- infected HL-1 cells, S100A8 and S100A9 enhanced oxidative stress and CVB3 copy number compared with unstimulated infected cells. In CVB3- infected RAW macrophages, both alarmins increased MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2) chemokine expression, which was reduced in CVB3 S100A8 knockdown versus scrambled siRNA CVB3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: S100A8 and S100A9 aggravate CVB3-induced myocarditis and might serve as therapeutic targets in inflammatory cardiomyopathies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coxsackievirus B3", "Myocarditis", "RAGE", "S100A8", "S100A9"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Calgranulin A", "Calgranulin B", "Case-Control Studies", "Chemokine CXCL2", "Coxsackievirus Infections", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enterovirus B, Human", "Female", "Fibrosis", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Middle Aged", "Myocarditis", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Neutrophil Infiltration", "Oxidative Stress", "RAW 264.7 Cells", "Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Messenger", "Signal Transduction", "Transfection", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039840034", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56425199200": {"Name": "M\u00fcller I.", "AuthorID": "56425199200", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research)"}, "55316931600": {"Name": "Pappritz K.", "AuthorID": "55316931600", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research)"}, "36561989600": {"Name": "Miteva K.", "AuthorID": "36561989600", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charit\u00e9, University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow"}, "57207905698": {"Name": "Savvatis K.", "AuthorID": "57207905698", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "35499467500": {"Name": "Pieske B.", "AuthorID": "35499467500", "AffiliationID": "60009113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin (DHZB)"}, "26643567500": {"Name": "K\u00fchl U.", "AuthorID": "26643567500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Charit\u00e9- Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum"}, "6602562561": {"Name": "Van Linthout S.", "AuthorID": "6602562561", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research)"}, "7003819329": {"Name": "Tsch\u00f6pe C.", "AuthorID": "7003819329", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research)"}, "35444602000": {"Name": "Vogl T.", "AuthorID": "35444602000", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "35096565200": {"Name": "Rohde D.", "AuthorID": "35096565200", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Center for Molecular and Translational Cardiology, University of Heidelberg"}, "6602896921": {"Name": "Most P.", "AuthorID": "6602896921", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK, (German Center for Cardiovascular Research)"}, "24450730500": {"Name": "Lassner D.", "AuthorID": "24450730500", "AffiliationID": "112981941", "AffiliationName": "Institut Kardiale Diagnostik und Therapie (IKDT)"}}}
