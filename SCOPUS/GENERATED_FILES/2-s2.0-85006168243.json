Using the optomechanical transduction from the WGM supported by the microsphere1, we can simultaneously detect the thermal Brownian motion of both the microsphere-cantilever and the tapered fiber used for coupling. This allows for active feedback cooling of multiple mechanical modes of the tapered fiber and the microsphere-cantilever using the optical dipole force and a piezo-stack2. Stabilisation of the coupling junction by employing simultaneous cooling of both oscillators is also presented2, useful for many hybrid WGM systems coupled with a tapered waveguide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Feedback cooling", "Laser cooling", "Tapered fiber", "Whispering gallery modes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Feedback cooling", "Mechanical motions", "Optical dipoles", "Silica microspheres", "Simultaneous cooling", "Tapered fiber", "Tapered optical fibers", "Tapered waveguide"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006168243", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55550008000": {"Name": "Lia Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55550008000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22985827000": {"Name": "Millen J.", "AuthorID": "22985827000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
