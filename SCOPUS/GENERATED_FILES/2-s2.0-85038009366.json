We present here a ballistic transport study of patterned surface gates on strained Ge quantum wells with SiGe barriers, which confirms the quantum characteristics of the Ge heavy hole valence band structure in 1-dimension. Quantised conductance at multiples of 2e2/h is a universal feature of hole transport in Ge up to 10 \u00d7 (2e2/h). The behaviour of ballistic plateaus with finite source-drain bias and applied magnetic field is elucidated. In addition, a reordering of the ground state is observed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Applied magnetic fields", "Ballistic transports", "Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible", "Large-scale fabrication", "Patterned surface", "Quantum transport", "Semiconductor nanostructures", "Silicon substrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038009366", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57195947109": {"Name": "Gul Y.", "AuthorID": "57195947109", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56463590500": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "56463590500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7203030829": {"Name": "Holmes S.N.", "AuthorID": "7203030829", "AffiliationID": "60018735", "AffiliationName": "Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Cambridge Research Laboratory"}, "55712007100": {"Name": "Ellis D.J.P.", "AuthorID": "55712007100", "AffiliationID": "60018735", "AffiliationName": "Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Cambridge Research Laboratory"}, "56647638700": {"Name": "Newton P.J.", "AuthorID": "56647638700", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55259942400": {"Name": "Barnes C.H.W.", "AuthorID": "55259942400", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "56230009400": {"Name": "Morrison C.", "AuthorID": "56230009400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "6601969075": {"Name": "Myronov M.", "AuthorID": "6601969075", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
