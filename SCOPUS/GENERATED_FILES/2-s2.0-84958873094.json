We present the first exploratory study on serum NfL in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and healthy controls. Methods We investigated serum NfL levels in 100 patients with CIS with a short conversion interval to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (fast converters (FC), median (IQR) conversion time: 110 days (79-139)); 98 patients with non-converting CIS (non-converters (NC), follow-up: 6.5 years (5.3-7.9)); and 92 healthy controls. Results NfL levels were higher in FC (24.1 pg/mL (13.5-51.8)) and NC (19.3 pg/mL (13.6-35.2)) than in healthy controls (7.9 pg/mL (5.6-17.2)) (OR=5.85; 95% CI 2.63 to 13.02; p=1.5\u00d710-5 and OR=7.03; 95% CI 2.85 to 17.34; p=2.3\u00d710-5, respectively). When grouping FC and NC, increased serum NfL concentration was also associated with increasing numbers of T2 hyperintense MRI lesions (OR=2.36; 95% CI 1.21 to 4.59; p=0.011), gadolinium-enhancing lesions (OR=2.69; 95% CI 1.13 to 6.41; p=0.026) and higher disability scores (OR=2.54; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.31; p=0.013) at CIS diagnosis. Conclusions If replicated in future studies, serum NfL may represent a reliable and easily accessible biomarker of early axonal damage in CIS and MS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Axons", "Biomarkers", "Demyelinating Diseases", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Predictive Value of Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958873094", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26631703200": {"Name": "Disanto G.", "AuthorID": "26631703200", "AffiliationID": "60018252", "AffiliationName": "Neurocentre of Southern Switzerland, Ospedale Civico"}, "56156549300": {"Name": "Adiutori R.", "AuthorID": "56156549300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "36093903900": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "36093903900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "8937520800": {"Name": "Kuhle J.", "AuthorID": "8937520800", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7005415704": {"Name": "Martinelli V.", "AuthorID": "7005415704", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and INSPE, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele"}, "6506426520": {"Name": "Costa G.D.", "AuthorID": "6506426520", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and INSPE, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele"}, "55315357700": {"Name": "Runia T.", "AuthorID": "55315357700", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus MC University Medical Center"}, "51763507000": {"Name": "Evdoshenko E.", "AuthorID": "51763507000", "AffiliationID": "107018242", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Multiple Sclerosis"}, "35325407800": {"Name": "Thouvenot E.", "AuthorID": "35325407800", "AffiliationID": "60013046", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Montpellier and H\u00f4pital Car\u00e9meau"}, "7005165969": {"Name": "Trojano M.", "AuthorID": "7005165969", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sense Organs, University of Bari"}, "6507640983": {"Name": "Norgren N.", "AuthorID": "6507640983", "AffiliationID": "60112896", "AffiliationName": "Uman Diagnostics"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Laboratory and Biobank, Department of Clinical Chemistry, MS Center, Neurocampus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7004559324": {"Name": "Kappos L.", "AuthorID": "7004559324", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
