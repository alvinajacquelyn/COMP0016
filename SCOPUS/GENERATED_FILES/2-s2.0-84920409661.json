T cell differentiation originally was considered a dichotomy between Th1 and Th2 cells, with Th1 cells deemed culpable for autoimmune islet destruction. Now, multiple additional T cell differentiation fates are recognized with distinct roles. Here, we used a transgenic mouse model of diabetes to probe the gene expression profile of islet-specific T cells by microarray and identified a clear follicular helper T (Tfh) cell differentiation signature. Introduction of T cells with a Tfh cell phenotype from diabetic animals efficiently transferred diabetes to recipient animals. Furthermore, memory T cells from patients with T1D expressed elevated levels of Tfh cell markers, including CXCR5, ICOS, PDCD1, BCL6, and IL21. Defects in the IL-2 pathway are associated with T1D, and IL-2 inhibits Tfh cell differentiation in mice. Consistent with these previous observations, we found that IL-2 inhibited human Tfh cell differentiation and identified a relationship between IL-2 sensitivity in T cells from patients with T1D and acquisition of a Tfh cell phenotype. Together, these findings identify a Tfh cell signature in autoimmune diabetes and suggest that this population could be used as a biomarker and potentially targeted for T1D interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Autoantigens", "Case-Control Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Female", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Interleukin-2", "Interleukins", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Transgenic", "Pancreas", "Receptors, CXCR5", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer", "Transcriptome", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920409661", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"10046631800": {"Name": "Kenefeck R.", "AuthorID": "10046631800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "56468584400": {"Name": "Wang C.J.", "AuthorID": "56468584400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "54386197100": {"Name": "Wardzinski L.", "AuthorID": "54386197100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "8873048100": {"Name": "Heuts F.", "AuthorID": "8873048100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "56469610800": {"Name": "Kogimtzis A.", "AuthorID": "56469610800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "57220554357": {"Name": "Rosenthal M.", "AuthorID": "57220554357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "7005289543": {"Name": "Sansom D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005289543", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "7402359366": {"Name": "Walker L.S.K.", "AuthorID": "7402359366", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "56469655300": {"Name": "Kapadi T.", "AuthorID": "56469655300", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences"}, "36607419400": {"Name": "Attridge K.", "AuthorID": "36607419400", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences"}, "35721735200": {"Name": "Clough L.E.", "AuthorID": "35721735200", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences"}, "57220739341": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "57220739341", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences"}, "7004252523": {"Name": "Narendran P.", "AuthorID": "7004252523", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, College of Medical and Dental Sciences"}, "55628557887": {"Name": "Ono M.", "AuthorID": "55628557887", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
