We undertook a modified Delphi consensus exercise to identify agreement in the management of chronic anterior uveitis (CAU), the most common manifestation of childhood disease. Methods: A four-round, two-panel process was undertaken between June and December 2017. Paediatric uveitis specialists identified through multiple sources, including a multicentre network (the Paediatric Ocular Inflammation Group), were invited to participate. They were asked whether they agreed with items derived from existing guidelines on the management of JIA-U when extrapolated to the population of all children with CAU. Consensus was defined as agreement greater than or equal to 75% of respondents. Results: 26 of the 38 (68%) invited specialists participated with the exercise, and response rates were 100% for rounds one to three, and 92% for round four. Consensus was reached on 23 of the 44 items. Items for which consensus was not reached included management at presentation, use of systemic and periocular steroids for children with severe disease and the role of conventional steroid sparing immunosuppressants beyond methotrexate. Conclusion: The areas of management uncertainty at the level of the group, as indicated by absence of consensus, reflect the areas where the evidence base is particularly poor. Our findings identify the key areas for the future research needed to ensure better outcomes for this blinding childhood ocular inflammatory disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child", "delphi technique", "disease management", "uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Chronic Disease", "Delphi Technique", "Disease Management", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Uveitis, Anterior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065249961", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"17342850000": {"Name": "Solebo A.L.", "AuthorID": "17342850000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172638, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Institute of Child Heath, University College London"}, "57191956020": {"Name": "Rahi J.S.", "AuthorID": "57191956020", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172638, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Institute of Child Heath, University College London"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, University of Bristol"}, "57207652117": {"Name": "Edelsten C.", "AuthorID": "57207652117", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003605847": {"Name": "Ramanan A.V.", "AuthorID": "7003605847", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7102398029": {"Name": "Ashworth J.", "AuthorID": "7102398029", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
