Notwithstanding this, we describe here devastating neurological complications associated with the detection of live-attenuated mumps virus Jeryl Lynn (MuVJL5) in the brain of a child who had undergone successful allogeneic transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This is the first confirmed report of MuVJL5 associated with chronic encephalitis and highlights the need to exclude immunodeficient individuals from immunisation with live-attenuated vaccines. The diagnosis was only possible by deep sequencing of the brain biopsy. Sequence comparison of the vaccine batch to the MuVJL5 isolated from brain identified biased hypermutation, particularly in the matrix gene, similar to those found in measles from cases of SSPE. The findings provide unique insights into the pathogenesis of paramyxovirus brain infections.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Brain", "Chronic Disease", "Encephalitis, Viral", "Fatal Outcome", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mumps Vaccine", "Mumps virus", "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992130159", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"36128773700": {"Name": "Morfopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "36128773700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56764219900": {"Name": "Ruis C.", "AuthorID": "56764219900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology, Virology and Infection Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24781117700": {"Name": "Mee E.T.", "AuthorID": "24781117700", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Virology Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "57009533200": {"Name": "Connaughton S.M.", "AuthorID": "57009533200", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Virology Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "16309386600": {"Name": "Ferguson D.", "AuthorID": "16309386600", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Virology Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "6603245046": {"Name": "Schepelmann S.", "AuthorID": "6603245046", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Virology Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "56477609700": {"Name": "Brown J.R.", "AuthorID": "56477609700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology, Virology and Infection Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203031127": {"Name": "Chong W.\u2018.", "AuthorID": "57203031127", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602171123": {"Name": "Duprex W.P.", "AuthorID": "6602171123", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "57203072549": {"Name": "Hubank M.", "AuthorID": "57203072549", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Medicine UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57194389535": {"Name": "Hutchinson C.", "AuthorID": "57194389535", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24768200000": {"Name": "Paine S.", "AuthorID": "24768200000", "AffiliationID": "60030816, 60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Queen\u2019s Medical Centre"}, "56387646400": {"Name": "Virasami A.", "AuthorID": "56387646400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "13609308000": {"Name": "Kaliakatsos M.", "AuthorID": "13609308000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7007023272": {"Name": "McQuaid S.", "AuthorID": "7007023272", "AffiliationID": "60024041, 60030456", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Pathology, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, Belfast City Hospital"}, "16402494600": {"Name": "Plagnol V.", "AuthorID": "16402494600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "35912174200": {"Name": "Zhan H.", "AuthorID": "35912174200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
