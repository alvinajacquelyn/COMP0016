Karger AG, Basel.Introduction: Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) devices are being used to determine ultrafiltration requirements to achieve target weight for haemodialysis (HD) patients. Pre-dialysis measurements are more convenient for both patients and staff. We wished to compare the changes in pre- and post-dialysis hydration measured by BIS with actual weight loss. Methods: We compared paired BIS measurements made pre and post HD using a BIS device based on a 3-compartmental model, designed to provide information on extracellular water (ECW) excess. Results: BIS was measured in 49 HD patients, 35 male (71.4%) with mean age 67.6 \u00b1 14.2. Weight fell significantly from 69.2 \u00b1 17.8 to 67.6 \u00b1 17.4 kg, and BIS over hydration (OH) from 4.5 \u00b1 3.3.4 to 3.4 \u00b1 2.9 litres, and ECW from 16.8 \u00b1 4.8 to 15.5 \u00b1 4.4 litres, but there was no change in the amount of intracellular water. Weight loss correlated positively with the change in ECW, but exceeded the fall in OH; mean bias -0.58 (95% confidence limits -3.6 to 4.8 kg). Summary: We measured OH pre and post HD, but did not find that the change in OH correlated with changes in body weight. Although there was a correlation between changes in OH and ECW, there was none for weight. Our findings do not support total reliance on pre-dialysis BIS alone for assessing volume status in HD patients, but rather BIS should be considered an aid to clinical assessment of volume status.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioimpedance", "Extracellular water", "Haemodialysis", "Hydration total body water", "Intracellular water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Fluids", "Body Weight", "Electric Impedance", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Renal Dialysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981554489", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56664498100": {"Name": "Tangvoraphonkchai K.", "AuthorID": "56664498100", "AffiliationID": "60002875", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Mahasarakham University"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}}}
