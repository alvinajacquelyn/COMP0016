In fact, till now, this has never been observed or predicted for the physically relevant case where a system is prepared to be quenched from one quantum phase to another. Here we show how the quench dynamics of the entanglement spectrum may reveal the emergence of such oscillations in a correlated quantum system with Kondo impurities. The oscillations we find are characterized by a single frequency. This frequency is independent of the amount of energy released by the local quench, and scales with the inverse system size. Importantly, the quench-independent frequency manifests itself also in local observables, such as the spin-spin correlation function of the impurities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946944515", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"8958172800": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "8958172800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005199114": {"Name": "Johannesson H.", "AuthorID": "7005199114", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Gothenburg"}, "56248410100": {"Name": "Sodano P.", "AuthorID": "56248410100", "AffiliationID": "60114762", "AffiliationName": "INFN, Sezione di Perugia"}}}
