Geometric methods are currently the only means of estimating volumetric wear from retrieved implants and numerous contrasting approaches to obtain these measures have been published. Data collection strategies have been thoroughly discussed and refined to minimise the effect of error incurring factors; however, there is an opportunity to optimise the current methods of estimating the pre-wear geometry and, therefore, improve the accuracy of wear volume measurements. An automated analysis strategy to quantify volumetric wear is proposed in this study, which utilises the entire bearing surface to determine the implants pristine geometry. This involves the iterative removal of geometrically effected data points to optimise the fit and size of a perfect sphere. Once fitted, this reference geometry is compared with the measured data, in its entirety, to calculate the volume change representative of the quantity of material lost. Improving the reliability of this parameter could influence the care of a million patients that remain with MOM hip implants. Rigorous validation of this method will dominate future work, ensuring that the accuracy and reliability of this approach are sufficient to provide clinically meaningful data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate quantifications", "Automated analysis", "Bearing materials", "Data collection strategies", "Hip replacements", "Retrieved implant", "Rigorous validation", "Wear volume measurement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067906681", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57204899818": {"Name": "Bergiers S.", "AuthorID": "57204899818", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57114287300": {"Name": "Richards R.", "AuthorID": "57114287300", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
