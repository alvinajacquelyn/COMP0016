We start with presenting a centralised global optimal control problem aiming to minimise the total travel delay in a motorway system. Given the centralised global optimal control solutions, we propose a set of decentralised ramp metering and speed control strategies which operate on a novel parsimonious dynamic platform without needing an underlying traffic model. The control strategies are applied to a case on UK M25 motorway. The results show that the proposed set of decentralised control is able to deliver a performance that is close to the global optimal ones with significantly less computational and implementation effort. This study provides new insights to motorway management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell transmission model", "Decentralised control", "Ramp metering", "Variable speed control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell transmission model", "Control strategies", "Decentralised control", "Global optimal control", "Motorway system", "Ramp metering", "Variable speed control", "Variable speed limits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928121007", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"36146863600": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "36146863600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
