All rights reserved.Quantum many-body systems exhibit an extremely diverse range of phases and physical phenomena. However, we prove that the entire physics of any quantum many-body system can be replicated by certain simple, \u201cuniversal\u201d spin-lattice models. We first characterize precisely what it means for one quantum system to simulate the entire physics of another. We then fully classify the simulation power of all two-qubit interactions, thereby proving that certain simple models can simulate all others, and hence are universal. Our results put the practical field of analogue Hamiltonian simulation on a rigorous footing and take a step toward justifying why error correction may not be required for this application of quantum information technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hamiltonian complexity", "Many-body physics", "Quantum information theory", "Quantum simulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053554479", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23768101300": {"Name": "Cubitt T.S.", "AuthorID": "23768101300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23028471900": {"Name": "Montanaro A.", "AuthorID": "23028471900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "57194559031": {"Name": "Piddock S.", "AuthorID": "57194559031", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}}}
