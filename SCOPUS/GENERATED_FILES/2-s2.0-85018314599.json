This study is the first to investigate neurobehavioural regulation and cognitive development in newborns and infants of mothers with EDs. Methods: Women with an active and past ED and healthy controls were recruited to a prospective longitudinal study during their first trimester or second trimester of pregnancy. Newborns and infants of mothers with ED were compared with newborns and infants of healthy controls on (a) neurobehavioural dysregulation using the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale at 8 days postpartum (active ED, n = 15; past ED, n = 20; healthy controls, n = 28); and (b) cognitive development using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 1-year postpartum (active ED, n = 18; past ED, n = 19; healthy controls, n = 28). In order to maintain the largest possible sample at each time point, sample size varied across time points. Results: Newborns of mothers with an active ED had worse autonomic stability when compared with newborns of healthy controls [B = \u22120.34 (\u22121.81, \u22120.26)]. Infants of mothers with a past ED had poorer language [B = \u22120.33 (\u221213.6, \u22121.9)] and motor development [B = \u22120.32 (\u221218.4, \u22121.3)] compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: Children of mothers with ED display neurobehavioural dysregulation early after birth and poorer language and motor development at 1 year. These characteristics suggest evidence of early neurobiological markers in children at risk. Differential outcomes in children of women with active versus past ED suggest that active symptomatology during pregnancy might have an effect on physiological reactivity while cognitive characteristics might be more stable markers of risk for ED.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development", "Brazelton Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale", "child development", "eating disorders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child Development", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Behavior", "Infant, Newborn", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mothers", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018314599", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56803731300": {"Name": "Barona M.", "AuthorID": "56803731300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "37004073700": {"Name": "Taborelli E.", "AuthorID": "37004073700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, Icahn Medical School at Mount Sinai"}, "55197325800": {"Name": "Corfield F.", "AuthorID": "55197325800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, KCL"}, "6602605462": {"Name": "Pawlby S.", "AuthorID": "6602605462", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, KCL"}, "7402009547": {"Name": "Schmidt U.", "AuthorID": "7402009547", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, KCL"}, "7006097367": {"Name": "Treasure J.", "AuthorID": "7006097367", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, KCL"}, "24586935300": {"Name": "Easter A.", "AuthorID": "24586935300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Services and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, KCL"}}}
