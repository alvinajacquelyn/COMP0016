A set of compounds is provided by GlaxoSmithKline, which represents a range of chemical functionality and binding affinities. The predicted binding free energies exhibit a good Spearman correlation of 0.78 with the experimental data from the 3-trajectory ESMACS, and an excellent correlation of 0.92 from the TIES approach where applicable. Given access to suitable high end computing resources and a high degree of automation, we can compute individual binding affinities in a few hours with precisions no greater than 0.2 kcal/mol for TIES, and no larger than 0.34 and 1.71 kcal/mol for the 1- and 3-trajectory ESMACS approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Drug Discovery", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012926333", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7202726029": {"Name": "Wan S.", "AuthorID": "7202726029", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57191586684": {"Name": "Bhati A.", "AuthorID": "57191586684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "15046291200": {"Name": "Zasada S.", "AuthorID": "15046291200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "14822781600": {"Name": "Wall I.", "AuthorID": "14822781600", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "56231216400": {"Name": "Green D.", "AuthorID": "56231216400", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "6602921846": {"Name": "Bamborough P.", "AuthorID": "6602921846", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
