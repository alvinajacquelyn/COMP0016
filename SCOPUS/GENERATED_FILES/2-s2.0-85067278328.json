Drawing upon previous theoretical and empirical work on the common agency problem, we contend that the joint influence of a country's memberships in multiple international governmental organizations (IGOs) generates consistent, unintended, disruptive effects, which reduces domestic accountability and can worsen the quality of a domestic government. Even if we assume that joining any particular IGO is beneficial for member states, the competing demands of multiple IGO memberships could undermine the quality of their governments. Our comparative, cross-national empirical findings support this theoretical expectation. Countries participating in a larger number of IGOs tend to have poorer scores on five widely used indicators of the quality of a domestic government. Future research should identify the types of policies and countries where the negative externalities of international cooperation on domestic accountability are greatest.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agency loss", "Domestic accountability", "International governmental organizations", "Multiple principals", "Quality of domestic government"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067278328", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6504566147": {"Name": "Abouharb M.R.", "AuthorID": "6504566147", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University College of London"}, "13205032700": {"Name": "Cingranelli D.", "AuthorID": "13205032700", "AffiliationID": "60020273, 60002337", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, Binghamton University, SUNY"}, "7005557564": {"Name": "Filippov M.", "AuthorID": "7005557564", "AffiliationID": "60020273, 60002337", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, Binghamton University, SUNY"}}}
