Hundreds of developmental studies in the last 30 years have shown that children under 4 fail standard false-belief tasks. However, recent studies have revealed that bilingual children and adults outperform their monolingual peers in this type of tasks. Bilinguals\u2019 better performance in false-belief tasks has generally been interpreted as a result of their better inhibitory control; that is, bilinguals are allegedly better than monolinguals at inhibiting the erroneous response to the false-belief question. In this review, I challenge the received view and argue instead that bilinguals\u2019 better false-belief performance results from more effective attention management. This challenge ties in with two independent lines of research: on the one hand, recent studies on the role of attentional processes in false-belief tasks with monolingual children and adults; and on the other, current research on bilinguals\u2019 performance in different Executive Function tasks. The review closes with an exploratory discussion of further benefits of bilingual cognition to Theory of Mind development and pragmatics, which may be independent from Executive Function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attentional processes", "Executive Function", "False-belief task", "Response inhibition", "Theory of Mind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Cognition", "Executive Function", "Humans", "Inhibition (Psychology)", "Multilingualism", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984652753", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"22956536900": {"Name": "Rubio-Fern\u00e1ndez P.", "AuthorID": "22956536900", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature, University of Oslo"}}}
