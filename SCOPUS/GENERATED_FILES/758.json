However, upon infection of various human cell lines and primary fibroblasts with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we detected DNA complementary to the VSV RNA. The VSV DNA was detected in the cytoplasm as single-stranded DNA fully complementary to the viral mRNA from the poly(A) region to the 7-methyl guanosine cap. The formation of this DNA was cell-dependent. Experimentally, we found that the transduction of cells that do not produce VSV DNA with the long interspersed nuclear element 1 and their infection with VSV could lead to the formation of VSV DNA. Viral DNA complementary to other RNA viruses was also detected in the respective infected human cells. Thus, the genetic information of the non-retroviral RNA virus genome can flow into the DNA of mammalian cells expressing LINE-1-like elements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Base Sequence", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytoplasm", "DNA, Complementary", "DNA, Viral", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Retroviridae", "Vesicular Stomatitis", "Virus Integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84901790143", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55628558289": {"Name": "Shimizu A.", "AuthorID": "55628558289", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology and Wohl Virion Centre, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "25028507000": {"Name": "Nakatani Y.", "AuthorID": "25028507000", "AffiliationID": "60162044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "56192832500": {"Name": "Nakamura T.", "AuthorID": "56192832500", "AffiliationID": "60162044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "6508081429": {"Name": "Jinno-Oue A.", "AuthorID": "6508081429", "AffiliationID": "60162044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7201966720": {"Name": "Hoshino H.", "AuthorID": "7201966720", "AffiliationID": "60162044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "57191240717": {"Name": "Ishikawa O.", "AuthorID": "57191240717", "AffiliationID": "60162044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "10240869900": {"Name": "Boeke J.D.", "AuthorID": "10240869900", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "High Throughput Biology Centre, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 335 Broadway Research Building"}, "34868874800": {"Name": "Takeuchi Y.", "AuthorID": "34868874800", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology and Wohl Virion Centre, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
