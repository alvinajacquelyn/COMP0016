NGC 1365 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy with a starburst ring in its nuclear region. In this work we look at the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data from four 2012-13, three 2007 and two 2004 observations of NGC 1365, in order to analyse and characterise in a uniform way the soft X-ray narrow-line emitting gas in the nucleus. Aims. We characterise the narrow-line emitting gas visible by XMM-Newton RGS and make comparisons between the 2012-13 spectra and those from 2004-07, already published. Methods. This source is usually absorbed within the soft X-ray band, with a typical neutral column density of >1.5 \u00d7 1023 cm-2, and only one observation of the nine we investigate shows low enough absorption for the continuum to emerge in the soft X-rays. We stack all observations from 2004-07, and separately three of the four observations from 2012-13, analysing the less absorbed observation separately. We first model the spectra using Gaussian profiles representing the narrow line emission. We fit physically motivated models to the 2012-13 stacked spectra, with collisionally ionised components representing the starburst emission and photoionised line emission models representing the AGN line emission. The collisional and photoionised emission line models are fitted together (rather than holding either one constant), on top of a physical continuum and absorption model. Results. The X-ray narrow emission line spectrum of NGC 1365 is well represented by a combination of two collisionally ionised (kT of 220 \u00b1 10 and 570 \u00b1 15 eV) and three photoionised (log \u03be of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2, 2.5 \u00b1 0.2, 1.1 \u00b1 0.2) phases of emitting gas, all with higher than solar nitrogen abundances. This physical model was fitted to the 2012-13 stacked spectrum, and yet also fits well to the 2004-07 stacked spectrum, without changing any characteristics of the emitting gas phases. Our 2004-07 results are consistent with previous emission line work using these data, with five additional emission lines detected in both this and the 2012-13 stacked spectra. We also estimate the distance of the X-ray line-emitting photoionised gas from the central source to be <300 pc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: active", "Galaxies: Seyfert", "X-rays: galaxies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption model", "Galaxies : active", "Galaxies: seyfert", "Gaussian profiles", "Ionised components", "Reflection grating spectrometers", "Seyfert 2 galaxies", "X rays:galaxies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994614339", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56222593400": {"Name": "Whewell M.", "AuthorID": "56222593400", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "55405630600": {"Name": "Branduardi-Raymont G.", "AuthorID": "55405630600", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "8740690900": {"Name": "Page M.J.", "AuthorID": "8740690900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
