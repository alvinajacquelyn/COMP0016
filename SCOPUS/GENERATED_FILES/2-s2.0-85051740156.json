From a methodological point of view, the immediate benefit of having such a protocol is twofold. Firstly, a good estimate of a second moment of a nuclear-momentum distribution, and hence nuclear kinetic energy, provided as input for subsequent data fitting, accelerates the convergence of a data fit and minimises the likelihood of it being stuck in a non-physical solution. Secondly, it provides a simple screening tool in the search for quantum systems exhibiting statistically significant departures for a classical behaviour of equipartition of kinetic energy at any given temperature. This second benefit renders the presented protocol an important data screening tool in the search of materials exhibiting exotic properties, possibly attributed to nuclear quantum effects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data pre treatments", "Equipartition of kinetic energy", "Exotic properties", "Final-state effects", "Harmonic limit", "Momentum distributions", "Neutron spectroscopy", "Nuclear quantum effects"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051740156", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"9532905200": {"Name": "Krzystyniak M.", "AuthorID": "9532905200", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Campus"}, "54684802600": {"Name": "Romanelli G.", "AuthorID": "54684802600", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57203431361": {"Name": "Tolchenov R.", "AuthorID": "57203431361", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "19933285200": {"Name": "Gigg M.", "AuthorID": "19933285200", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57203431875": {"Name": "Hewer B.", "AuthorID": "57203431875", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55924594300": {"Name": "Fernandez-Alonso F.", "AuthorID": "55924594300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
