In this longitudinal study, we investigated self-injury in a cohort of individuals with ASD over 3 years to identify behavioural and demographic characteristics associated with persistence. Methods: Carers of 67 individuals with ASD (Median age of individuals with ASD in years = 13.5, Interquartile Range = 10.00-17.00), completed questionnaires relating to the presence and topography of self-injury at T1 and three years later at T2. Analyses were conducted to evaluate the persistence of self-injury and to evaluate the behavioural and demographic characteristics associated with persistence of self-injury. Results: At T2 self-injurious behaviour had persisted in 77.8 % of individuals. Behavioural correlates of being non-verbal, having lower ability and higher levels of overactivity, impulsivity and repetitive behaviour, were associated with self-injury at both time points. Risk markers of impulsivity (p = 0.021) and deficits in social interaction (p = 0.026) at T1 were associated with the persistence of self-injury over 3 years. Conclusions: Impulsivity and deficits in social interaction are associated with persistent self-injury in ASD and thus may act as behavioural risk markers. The identification of these risk markers evidences a role for behaviour dysregulation in the development and maintenance of self-injury. The findings have clinical implications for proactive intervention; these behavioural characteristics may be utilised to identify 'at risk' individuals for whom self-injury is likely to be persistent and therefore those individuals for whom early intervention may be most warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Hyperactivity", "Impulsivity", "Pain", "Prevalence", "Risk marker", "Self-injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964956149", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7201655991": {"Name": "Richards C.", "AuthorID": "7201655991", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "25652154200": {"Name": "Moss J.", "AuthorID": "25652154200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "57196590272": {"Name": "Nelson L.", "AuthorID": "57196590272", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "57203219218": {"Name": "Oliver C.", "AuthorID": "57203219218", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}}}
