The Gaussian positions and widths are tailored to the potential using the procedure of Ba\u010di\u0107 and Light (1986 J. Chem. Phys. 85 4594) which has previously been applied to bound-state problems. The placement procedure is shown to be very efficient and gives scattering wavefunctions and observables in agreement with direct numerical solutions. We demonstrate the basis function placement method with applications to hydrogen atom-hydrogen atom scattering and antihydrogen atom-hydrogen atom scattering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Kohn variational", "low energy scattering", "matterantimatter interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antihydrogen atoms", "Bound-state problems", "Gaussian basis functions", "Gaussian functions", "Kohn variational", "Kohn variational method", "Low-energy scattering", "Scattering problems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044426881", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55633703600": {"Name": "Mant B.", "AuthorID": "55633703600", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, University of Aberdeen"}, "7202652158": {"Name": "Law M.", "AuthorID": "7202652158", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, University of Aberdeen"}}}
