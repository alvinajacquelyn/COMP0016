We first present the closed-form expression of the system achievable rate and its asymptotic behaviors at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the large antenna number scenarios. It is shown that the high SNR approximation increases with more antennas and higher ratio between the transmit SNR at the base station (BS) and the D2D transmitter. In addition, a tight approximation is derived for the rate and we reveal two thresholds for both the distance of the D2D link and the transmit SNR at the BS above which the underlaid D2D communication will degrade the system rate. We then particularize on the small cell setting where all users are closely located. In the small cell scenario, we show that the relationship between the distance of the D2D transmitting link and that of the D2D interfering link to the cellular user determines whether the D2D communication can enhance the systemachievable rate. Numerical results are provided to verify these results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Achievable rate gain", "antenna selection", "device-todevice(D2D)", "system spectral efficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable rate gain", "Antenna selection", "Device-to-Device communications", "device-todevice(D2D)", "Deviceto-device (D2D) communication", "High signalto-noise ratios (SNR)", "Interference mitigation", "System spectral efficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990184513", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56493209600": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "56493209600", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "56123091200": {"Name": "Ni Y.", "AuthorID": "56123091200", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
