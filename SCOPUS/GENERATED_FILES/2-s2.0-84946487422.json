We propose a new pseudo-haptic feedback-based method capable of conveying 3D haptic information and combining visual haptics with force feedback to enhance the user\u2019s haptic experience. We focused on an application related to tumor identification during palpation and evaluated the proposed method in an experimental study where users interacted with a haptic device and graphical interface while exploring a virtual model of soft tissue, which represented stiffness distribution of a silicone phantom tissue with embedded hard inclusions. The performance of hard inclusion detection using force feedback only, pseudo-haptic feedback only, and the combination of the two feedbacks was compared with the direct hand touch. The combination method and direct hand touch had no significant difference in the detection results. Compared with the force feedback alone, our method increased the sensitivity by 5 %, the positive predictive value by 4 %, and decreased detection time by 48.7 %. The proposed methodology has great potential for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and in all applications where remote haptic feedback is needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Haptic feedback", "Pseudo-haptic feedback", "Rigid tool/soft tissue interaction", "Tumor identification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combination method", "Graphical interface", "Haptic feedbacks", "Minimally invasive surgery", "Positive predictive values", "Pseudo haptic feedback", "Stiffness distributions", "Tissue interactions", "Equipment Design", "Feedback", "Humans", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms", "Palpation", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Robotic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946487422", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55268532700": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "55268532700", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University"}, "56027304200": {"Name": "Konstantinova J.", "AuthorID": "56027304200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Kings College London"}, "7004042937": {"Name": "Secco E.L.", "AuthorID": "7004042937", "AffiliationID": "60105090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hope University"}, "55556588700": {"Name": "Jiang A.", "AuthorID": "55556588700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Kings College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Kings College London"}, "6508336274": {"Name": "Nanayakkara T.", "AuthorID": "6508336274", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Kings College London"}, "7006006173": {"Name": "Seneviratne L.D.", "AuthorID": "7006006173", "AffiliationID": "60104134", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Kings College London"}, "35119695800": {"Name": "Wurdemann H.A.", "AuthorID": "35119695800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Kings College London"}, "7201405986": {"Name": "Dasgupta P.", "AuthorID": "7201405986", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520, 60109217, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Transplantation, King\u2019s College London, Kings Health Partners, Guys Hospital"}}}
