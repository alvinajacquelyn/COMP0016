All the chitosan derivatives [N-trimethyl (TMC), chloride and glutamate] and carboxymethyl pullulan (CMP) were synthesised and antigen-loaded composites were prepared by polyion complexation of chitosan and pullulan derivatives (particle size: 239-405 nm; surface charge: +18 and +27 mV). Their immunological effects after intranasal administration to mice were compared to intramuscular route. Composite nanoparticles induced higher levels of IgG responses than particles formed with chitosan derivative and antigen. Nasally administered TMC-pullulan composites showed higher DT serum IgG titre when compared with the other composites. Co-encapsulation of CpG ODN within TMC-CMP-DT nanoparticles resulted in a balanced Th1/Th2 response. TMC/pullulan composite nanoparticles also induced highest cytokine levels compared to those of chitosan salts. These findings demonstrated that TMC-CMP-DT composite nanoparticles are promising delivery system for nasal vaccination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carboxymethyl pullulan", "chitosan derivatives", "intramuscular immunisation", "nanoparticles", "nasal immunisation", "polyion complexation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intranasal", "Animals", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Chitosan", "Diphtheria Toxoid", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Nanocomposites", "Oligodeoxyribonucleotides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945495370", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"14025387100": {"Name": "Cevher E.", "AuthorID": "14025387100", "AffiliationID": "60028502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul University"}, "56814611100": {"Name": "Salomon S.K.", "AuthorID": "56814611100", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "7006524321": {"Name": "Alpar H.O.", "AuthorID": "7006524321", "AffiliationID": "60104489", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kemerburgaz University"}}}
