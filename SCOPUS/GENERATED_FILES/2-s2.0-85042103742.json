Five alternative centre bow configurations were considered, and multiple series of model tests were conducted in regular head sea waves. The results showed that both heave and pitch increased over a wide range of wave encounter frequency as the wet-deck height of the catamaran model increased. However, increasing the length of the centre bow showed an increase in the pitch but a decrease in the heave for a limited range of wave encounter frequency near the heave and pitch resonance frequencies of the catamaran model. The positions of minimum vertical displacement were found to be aft of the longitudinal centre of gravity, between 20% and 38% of the overall length from the transom. Increase in the wet-deck height and consequently the archway clearance between the main hulls and centre bow also resulted in an increase in the vertical displacement relative to the undisturbed water surface in the centre bow area. The results also indicated the vulnerability to wet-deck slamming for the different bow and wet-deck designs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["high speed catamarans", "Maritime systems research/design/development", "motion response to regular waves", "relative motion", "slamming exposure", "wave piercing catamarans; centre bow and wet deck geometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["High Speed", "Maritime systems", "Regular waves", "Relative motion", "Wave piercing catamaran"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042103742", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57200651220": {"Name": "Shabani B.", "AuthorID": "57200651220", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania"}, "35192156100": {"Name": "Lavroff J.", "AuthorID": "35192156100", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania"}, "7101792459": {"Name": "Holloway D.", "AuthorID": "7101792459", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania"}, "35600466300": {"Name": "Davis M.", "AuthorID": "35600466300", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
