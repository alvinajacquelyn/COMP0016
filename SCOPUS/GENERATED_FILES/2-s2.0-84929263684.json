Notably, it was demonstrated using magnetoencephalography that the brain regions involved were recruited as soon as 200 ms post-stimulus. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to characterize an electrophysiological marker of attribution of intentions. We also explored the robustness of this ERP signature under two conditions corresponding to either explicit instructions to focus on others\u2019 intentions or implicit instructions with no reference to mental states. Two matched groups of 16 healthy volunteers each received either explicit or no instructions about intentions and performed a nonverbal attribution of intentions task based on sequential four-image comic strips depicting either intentional or physical causality. A bilateral posterior positive component, ranging from 250 to 650 ms post-stimulus, showed greater amplitude in intentional than in physical condition (the intention ERP effect). This effect occurs during the third image only, suggesting that it reflects the integration of information depicted in the third image to the contextual cues given by the first two. The intention effect was similar in the two groups of subjects. Overall, our results identify a clear ERP marker of the first hundreds of milliseconds of intentions processing probably related to a contextual integrative mechanism and suggest its robustness by showing its blindness to task demands manipulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attribution of intentions", "Event-related potentials", "Posterior positivity", "Verbal instructions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Electroencephalography", "Empathy", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Intention", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Photic Stimulation", "Theory of Mind", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929263684", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"23483146800": {"Name": "Vistoli D.", "AuthorID": "23483146800", "AffiliationID": "60082765", "AffiliationName": "Centre Interdisciplinaire de Recherche en R\u00e9adaptation et Int\u00e9gration Sociale"}, "6601943271": {"Name": "Passerieux C.", "AuthorID": "6601943271", "AffiliationID": "60106309, 60029937, 60020966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire ECIPSY Unit\u00e9 EA4047, Universit\u00e9 Versailles St-Quentin et Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Fondation FondaMental"}, "57040934900": {"Name": "El Zein M.", "AuthorID": "57040934900", "AffiliationID": "60106309, 60029937, 60020966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire ECIPSY Unit\u00e9 EA4047, Universit\u00e9 Versailles St-Quentin et Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Fondation FondaMental"}, "15062482900": {"Name": "Brunet-Gouet E.", "AuthorID": "15062482900", "AffiliationID": "60106309, 60029937, 60020966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire ECIPSY Unit\u00e9 EA4047, Universit\u00e9 Versailles St-Quentin et Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Fondation FondaMental"}, "55805567200": {"Name": "Clumeck C.", "AuthorID": "55805567200", "AffiliationID": "60068575, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Recherches Psychiatriques, H\u00f4pital Erasme, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "35733146600": {"Name": "Braun S.", "AuthorID": "35733146600", "AffiliationID": "60068575, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Recherches Psychiatriques, H\u00f4pital Erasme, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}}}
