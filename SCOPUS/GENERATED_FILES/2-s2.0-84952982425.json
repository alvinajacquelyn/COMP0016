A fraction of its time will be used for ancillary science. We discuss here the prospect of a small survey of L and T-type brown dwarfs. These cold objects show properties comparable to those of giant planets, with the advantage of being brighter and not perturbed by host stars, therefore, they are very useful to understand processes and properties of planet atmospheres. At the same time, brown dwarfs still pose some challenges to stellar models that must include the formation of clouds and sedimentation processes that occur at the low temperatures of these objects. Hence, our aim is to build up an homogeneous catalogue of spectra of brown dwarfs as well as to characterize the spectral variability observed on some of them, which is attributed to the presence of clouds in their atmospheres. We demonstrate that EChO could provide the spectra of brown dwarfs between 1 and 11 \u03bcm with enough accuracy to reach these goals. We also present the current number of known brown dwarfs and we suggest a list of possible targets, although future surveys will probably provide better targets at the time of EChO launch if the mission is selected.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brown dwarfs", "Instrumentation: spectrographs", "Stars: atmospheres", "Stars: fundamental parameters", "Techniques: spectroscopic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952982425", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56501275900": {"Name": "Morales J.C.", "AuthorID": "56501275900", "AffiliationID": "60028894, 60123796, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "LESIA-Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, UPMC University Paris 06"}, "55958680900": {"Name": "Coud\u00e9 du Foresto V.", "AuthorID": "55958680900", "AffiliationID": "60028894, 60123796, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "LESIA-Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, UPMC University Paris 06"}, "7004245303": {"Name": "Drossart P.", "AuthorID": "7004245303", "AffiliationID": "60028894, 60123796, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "LESIA-Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, UPMC University Paris 06"}, "55553753900": {"Name": "Beaulieu J.P.", "AuthorID": "55553753900", "AffiliationID": "60015201, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Astrophysique de Paris UMR7095 UPMC CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie"}, "55893633200": {"Name": "Tinetti G.", "AuthorID": "55893633200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
