Methods: Patients with refractory extra-temporal focal epilepsy, referred for presurgical evaluation were recruited in a period of 18 months. The EEG-fMRI based localization was presented during a multi-disciplinary meeting after the team had defined the presumed Results: Sixteen patients (six women), with a median age of 28 years, were recruited. Interpretable EEG-fMRI results were available in 13: interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were recorded in eleven patients and seizures were recorded in two patients. In three patients, no epileptic activity was captured during EEG-fMRI acquisition and in two of those an IED topographic map correlation was performed (between EEG recorded inside the scanner and long-term video EEG monitoring). EEG-fMRI results presentation had no impact on the initial clinical decision in three patients (23%) of the thirteen and resulted in a modification of the initial surgical plan in ten patients (77%) of the thirteen finally presented in MDT; in eight patients the impact was on the planned placement of invasive electrodes and in two patients the EEG-fMRI led to additional non-invasive tests before proceeding further with surgery. Conclusion: The study is a prospective observational cohort study specifically designed to assess the impact of EEG-fMRI on the clinical decision making process, suggesting a significant influence of EEG-fMRI on epilepsy surgery planning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical management process", "EEG-fMRI", "Epilepsy surgery", "Extra-temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Brain Waves", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxygen", "Preoperative Care", "Prospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050514311", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15925775000": {"Name": "Markoula S.", "AuthorID": "15925775000", "AffiliationID": "60026075", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, University Hospitalof Ioannina"}, "7004000093": {"Name": "Chaudhary U.", "AuthorID": "7004000093", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Western General Hospital"}, "56741534900": {"Name": "Perani S.", "AuthorID": "56741534900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55803571900": {"Name": "De Ciantis A.", "AuthorID": "55803571900", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "55735370500": {"Name": "Yadee T.", "AuthorID": "55735370500", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}}}
