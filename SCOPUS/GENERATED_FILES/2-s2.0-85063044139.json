However, it is not yet evident whether this role prevails in the context of extreme poverty and frequent ill-health. We therefore investigated the role of the home environment in Ugandan children taking into account the frequent infections and extreme poverty in which they lived. Methods: Cognitive abilities of 163 5-year-old children were assessed. Home environments of these children, their health status and family socioeconomic status (SES) were assessed respectively using the EC-HOME, anthropometry and illnesses, and traditional SES measures. Structural equation analyses compared five models on the influence of the home environment, SES, and child health on the cognitive scores. Results: The model in which the home environment mediates the combined influence of SES and child health on cognitive performance showed a particularly good fit to the data compared with the four alternative models, i.e. those in which the HOME, SES and health independently influence cognitive performance. Conclusions: Home environments providing cognitive stimulation can enable children to overcome effects of major adverse life experiences on cognitive development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Cognitive function", "Health status", "Home environment", "Poverty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063044139", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"8988934800": {"Name": "Nampijja M.", "AuthorID": "8988934800", "AffiliationID": "120714650", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"}, "24802020500": {"Name": "Kizindo R.", "AuthorID": "24802020500", "AffiliationID": "120714650", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"}, "35798065400": {"Name": "Apule B.", "AuthorID": "35798065400", "AffiliationID": "120714650", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"}, "35798684000": {"Name": "Lule S.", "AuthorID": "35798684000", "AffiliationID": "120714650", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"}, "8988934900": {"Name": "Muhangi L.", "AuthorID": "8988934900", "AffiliationID": "120714650", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"}, "7201419696": {"Name": "Elliott A.", "AuthorID": "7201419696", "AffiliationID": "120714650", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"}, "24339413400": {"Name": "Titman A.", "AuthorID": "24339413400", "AffiliationID": "60117737, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Fylde College"}, "6603723389": {"Name": "Alcock K.", "AuthorID": "6603723389", "AffiliationID": "60117737, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Fylde College"}, "7402976047": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "7402976047", "AffiliationID": "60117737, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Fylde College"}}}
