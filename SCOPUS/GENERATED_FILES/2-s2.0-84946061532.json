We examined the behavioural and biological characteristics of healthy obese adults that progressed to an unhealthy state over 8 years follow-up. Methods: Participants were 2422 men and women (aged 63.3\u00b17.7 years, 44.2% men) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Obesity was defined as BMI R30 kg/m2. Based on blood pressure (BP), HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c and C-reactive protein (CRP) participants were classified as 'healthy' (0 or 1 metabolic abnormality) or 'unhealthy' (\u22652 metabolic abnormalities). Results: Over 8 years follow-up, 44.5% of healthy obese subjects had transitioned into an unhealthy state, compared to only 16.6 and 26.2% of healthy normal-weight and overweight adults respectively. Compared with healthy obese adults who remained stable, those who progressed to an unhealthy state were more likely to have high BP (75.0% vs 37.0%, age-and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 8.9, 95% CI 4.7-17.0), high CRP (53.7% vs 17.0%, OR=8.6, 95% CI 4.1-18.0), high HbA1c (46.3% vs 5.9%, OR=13.8, 95% CI 6.1-31.2) and high triglycerides (45.4% vs 11.9%, OR=5.9, 95% CI 2.9-12.0) at follow-up, with excess risk remaining independent of lifestyle factors including self-reported physical activity. Progression to an unhealthy state was also linked with significant gains in waist circumference (B=2.7, 95% CI, 0.5-4.9 cm). Conclusion: These data show that a healthy obesity phenotype is relatively unstable. Transition to an unhealthy state is characterised by multiple biological changes that are not fully explained by lifestyle risk factors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Disease Progression", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946061532", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55762450800": {"Name": "Bell J.A.", "AuthorID": "55762450800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24339408800": {"Name": "Sabia S.", "AuthorID": "24339408800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
