It is well known that the presence of multiple sequence repeats in TALEN genes hampers the use of lentiviral vectors. We report that lentiviral vectors readily package full-length vector mRNAs encoding TALENs, but recombination during reverse transcription prevents successful delivery. We reasoned that preventing reverse transcription of lentiviral-vector RNA would allow transfer of TALENs as mRNA. We demonstrate that lentiviral particles containing genetically inactivated reverse transcriptase (RT) mediated efficient transduction of cultured cells and supported transient transgene expression. For proof-of-principle, we transferred CCR5-and TCR-specific TALEN pairs for efficient targeted genome editing and abrogated expression for each of the receptor proteins in different cell lines. Combining the high specificity of TALENs with efficient lentiviral gene delivery should advance genome editing in vitro and potentially in vivo, and RT-deficient lentiviral vectors may be useful for transient expression of various other genes-of-interest.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Drug Delivery Systems", "Endonucleases", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Vectors", "Genome, Human", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Reverse Transcriptase", "Humans", "Lentivirus", "Mutation", "Receptors, CCR5", "RNA, Messenger", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923381487", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57147817100": {"Name": "Mock U.", "AuthorID": "57147817100", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Research Dept.
