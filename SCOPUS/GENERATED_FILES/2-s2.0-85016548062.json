The role of mTOR signalling in skin morphogenesis and epidermal development is unknown. Here we identify mTOR as an essential regulator in skin morphogenesis by epidermis-specific deletion of Mtor in mice (mTOREKO). mTOREKO mutants are viable, but die shortly after birth due to deficits primarily during the early epidermal differentiation programme and lack of a protective barrier development. Epidermis-specific loss of Raptor, which encodes an essential component of mTORC1, confers the same skin phenotype as seen in mTOREKO mutants. In contrast, newborns with an epidermal deficiency of Rictor, an essential component of mTORC2, survive despite a hypoplastic epidermis and disruption in late stage terminal differentiation. These findings highlight a fundamental role for mTOR in epidermal morphogenesis that is regulated by distinct functions for mTORC1 and mTORC2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Cell Differentiation", "Epidermal Cells", "Epidermis", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Morphogenesis", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016548062", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56482590100": {"Name": "Ding X.", "AuthorID": "56482590100", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne"}, "6603733275": {"Name": "Eming S.A.", "AuthorID": "6603733275", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne"}, "14524868700": {"Name": "Iden S.", "AuthorID": "14524868700", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne"}, "7004672813": {"Name": "Leptin M.", "AuthorID": "7004672813", "AffiliationID": "60007257", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory"}, "35481516500": {"Name": "Bloch W.", "AuthorID": "35481516500", "AffiliationID": "60012797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Sport Medicine, German Sport University Cologne"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution, Environment, University College London"}, "7005214351": {"Name": "R\u00fcegg M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005214351", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "25651688600": {"Name": "Hall M.N.", "AuthorID": "25651688600", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}}}
