Cardiopulmonary exercise testing variables can be used to risk stratify patients. This information can be used to help guide the choice of surgical procedure and to decide on the most appropriate postoperative care environment. Thus CPET can aid collaborative decision making and improve the process of informed consent. In the future, CPET may be combined with other risk predictors to improve outcome prediction. Furthermore early evidence suggests that CPET can be used to guide prehabilitation training programs, improving fitness and thereby reducing perioperative risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaerobic threshold (AT)", "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing", "Collaborative decision making", "Functional capacity", "Incremental exercise test", "Peak oxygen consumption (Vo2 peak)", "Preoperative", "Risk assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdomen", "Exercise Test", "Humans", "Oxygen Consumption", "Postoperative Complications", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Preoperative Care", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924982183", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"16052616700": {"Name": "Levett D.Z.H.", "AuthorID": "16052616700", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesia and Critical Care Research Unit, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesia and Critical Care Research Unit, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
