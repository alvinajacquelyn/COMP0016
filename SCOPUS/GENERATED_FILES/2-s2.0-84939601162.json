Although edited movies are frequently used as stimuli in ISC studies, there has been little direct examination of the effect of edits on the resulting ISC maps. In this study we showed 16 observers two audiovisual movie versions of the same dance. In one experimental condition there was a continuous view from a single camera (Unedited condition) and in the other condition there were views from different cameras (Edited condition) that provided close up views of the feet or face and upper body. We computed ISC maps for each condition, as well as created a map that showed the difference between the conditions. The results from the Unedited and Edited maps largely overlapped in the occipital and temporal cortices, although more voxels were found for the Edited map. The difference map revealed greater ISC for the Edited condition in the Postcentral Gyrus, Lingual Gyrus, Precentral Gyrus and Medial Frontal Gyrus, while the Unedited condition showed greater ISC in only the Superior Temporal Gyrus. These findings suggest that the visual changes associated with editing provide a source of correlation in maps obtained from edited film, and highlight the utility of using maps to evaluate the difference in ISC between conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dance", "FMRI", "Intersubject correlation", "Natural movies", "Vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Brain Mapping", "Dancing", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Individuality", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Occipital Lobe", "Parietal Lobe", "Photic Stimulation", "Temporal Lobe", "Video Recording", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939601162", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55849657500": {"Name": "Herbec A.", "AuthorID": "55849657500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Glasgow"}, "7004147308": {"Name": "Pollick F.", "AuthorID": "7004147308", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Glasgow"}, "36788570400": {"Name": "Kauppi J.", "AuthorID": "36788570400", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60000944", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, University of Helsinki"}, "26532791700": {"Name": "Jola C.", "AuthorID": "26532791700", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology, Abertay University"}, "6602349259": {"Name": "Tohka J.", "AuthorID": "6602349259", "AffiliationID": "60108393, 60033237, 60105312", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Gregorio Mara\u00f1on"}}}
