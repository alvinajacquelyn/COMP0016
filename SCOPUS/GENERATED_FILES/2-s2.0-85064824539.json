Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper addresses the significant need for improvements in device version reporting and practice across the academic and technical activity monitoring literature, and it recommends assessments for new and updated consumer sensing devices. Reproducibility and data veracity are central to good scholarship, and particularly significant in clinical and health applications. Across the literature there is an absence of device version reporting and a failure to recognize that device validity is not maintained when firmware and software updates can, and do, change device performance and parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose the use of tractable methods to assess devices at their current version and provide an example empirical approach. Experimental results for heart rate and step count acquisitions during walking and everyday living activities from Garmin Vivosmart 3 (v4.10) wristband monitors are presented and analyzed, and the reliability issues of optically-acquired heart rates, especially during periods of activity, are demonstrated and discussed. In conclusion, the paper recommends the empirical assessment of new and updated activity monitors and improvements in device version reporting across the academic and technical literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity monitoring", "Ambulatory heart rate", "Inter-instrument reliability", "Wearable sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity monitoring", "Assessment approaches", "Empirical assessment", "Heart rates", "Heart-rate monitors", "Technical activities", "Technical literature", "Wearable sensing", "Accelerometry", "Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Walking", "Wearable Electronic Devices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064824539", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7201800929": {"Name": "Collins T.", "AuthorID": "7201800929", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "7004374769": {"Name": "Woolley S.I.", "AuthorID": "7004374769", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University"}, "57208446279": {"Name": "Oniani S.", "AuthorID": "57208446279", "AffiliationID": "60071901", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Informatics and Control Systems, Georgian Technical University"}, "56715367700": {"Name": "Pires I.M.", "AuthorID": "56715367700", "AffiliationID": "60001002", "AffiliationName": "ALLab\u2014Assisted Living Computing and Telecommunications Laboratory, Computing Science Department, Universidade da Beira Interior"}, "8229776000": {"Name": "Garcia N.M.", "AuthorID": "8229776000", "AffiliationID": "60000015", "AffiliationName": "ECATI, Universidade Lus\u00f3fona de Humanidades e Tecnologias"}, "26026026400": {"Name": "Ledger S.J.", "AuthorID": "26026026400", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation, Keele University"}, "6602633532": {"Name": "Pandyan A.", "AuthorID": "6602633532", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation, Keele University"}}}
