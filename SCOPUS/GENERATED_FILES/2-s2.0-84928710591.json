Many of the open problems in current IR research can be described as dynamic systems, for instance, session search or computational adver-tising. State of the art research provides solutions to these problems that are responsive to a changing environment, learn from past interactions and predict future utility. Ad-vances in IR interface, personalization and ad display de-mand models that can react to users in real time and in an intelligent, contextual way. The objective of this half-day tutorial is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to Dynamic In-formation Retrieval Modeling. We motivate a conceptual model linking static, interactive and dynamic retrieval and use this to define dynamics within the context of IR. We then cover a number of algorithms and techniques from the artificial intelligence (AI) and online learning literature such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP) [1], their partially ob-servable variation (POMDP) [5] and multi-armed bandits [7]. Following this we describe how to identify dynamics in an IR problem and demonstrate how to model them using the described techniques. The remainder of the tutorial will then cover an array of state-of-the-art research on dynamic systems in IR and how they can be modeled using using dynamic IR [2, 6]. We use research on session search [3], multi-page search [4] and online advertising [8] as in-depth examples of such work. This tutorial is of relevance to IR practitioners and re-searchers, where we will present the merits of dynamic infor-mation retrieval modeling and introduce the relevant tech-niques. The content will be of particular interest to re-searchers working in the areas of statistical modeling, per-sonalization and recommendation, and is also relevant to practitioners in Web search, online advertising and anyone who works with big data. After this tutorial, attendees will: \u2022 Be able to identify the dynamics in an IR system \u2022Be able to model these dynamics using techniques from AI and reinforcement learning \u2022 Have knowledge of the state-of-the-art research in dy-namic information retrieval modeling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic information retrieval modeling", "Probabilistic rel-evance model", "Reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Changing environment", "Dynamic information retrieval", "Dynamic retrieval", "Information retrieval models", "Markov Decision Processes", "Multi armed bandit", "Online advertising", "Statistical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928710591", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56899355100": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "56899355100", "AffiliationID": "60023927", "AffiliationName": "Georgetown University"}, "55217996600": {"Name": "Sloan M.", "AuthorID": "55217996600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55902731900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55902731900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
