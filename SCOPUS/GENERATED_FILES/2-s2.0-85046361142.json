All rights reserved.Background/Aims To assess the diagnostic performance of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) data of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for detecting glaucoma. Methods Secondary analyses of a prospective, multicentre diagnostic study (Glaucoma Automated Tests Evaluation (GATE)) referred to hospital eye services in the UK were conducted. We included data from 899 of 966 participants referred to hospital eye services with suspected glaucoma or ocular hypertension. We used both eyes' data and logistic regression-based receiver operator characteristics analysis to build a set of models to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the average and inferior quadrant RNFL thickness data of OCT. The reference standard was expert clinician examination including automated perimetry. The main outcome measures were sensitivity at 0.95 specificity and specificity at 0.95 sensitivity and the corresponding RNFL thickness thresholds. We explored the possibility of accuracy improvement by adding measures of within-eye and between-eye variation, scan quality, intraocular pressure (IOP) and age. Results Glaucoma was diagnosed in at least one eye in 17% of participants. Areas under the curve were between 0.83 and 0.88. When specificity was fixed at 0.95, the sensitivity was between 0.38 and 0.55, and the highest values were reached with models including the inferior quadrant rather than the average RNFL thickness. Fixing sensitivity at 0.95, the specificity was between 0.36 and 0.58. The addition of age, refractive error, IOP or within-subject variation did not improve the accuracy. Conclusion RNFL thickness data of OCT can be used as a diagnostic test, but accuracy estimates remain moderate even in exploratory multivariable modelling of aiming to improve accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnostic tests/investigation", "glaucoma", "imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological", "Diagnostic Tests, Routine", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Fibers", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046361142", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7006732630": {"Name": "Virgili G.", "AuthorID": "7006732630", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Surgery and Medicine, Eye Clinic, University of Florence"}, "26433747300": {"Name": "Michelessi M.", "AuthorID": "26433747300", "AffiliationID": "60103773", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Fondazione G B Bietti per Lo Studio e la Ricerca in Oftalmologia-IRCCS"}, "36107010700": {"Name": "Cook J.", "AuthorID": "36107010700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "35361681700": {"Name": "Boachie C.", "AuthorID": "35361681700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "8439989300": {"Name": "Burr J.", "AuthorID": "8439989300", "AffiliationID": "60009979, 60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of St. Andrews"}, "57093950600": {"Name": "Banister K.", "AuthorID": "57093950600", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "7005242161": {"Name": "Ramsay C.R.", "AuthorID": "7005242161", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.F.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7103377631": {"Name": "Bourne R.R.A.", "AuthorID": "7103377631", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Vision and Eye Research Unit, Postgraduate Institute, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "55936304100": {"Name": "Asorey Garcia A.", "AuthorID": "55936304100", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital San Carlos"}, "7006394568": {"Name": "Azuara-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "7006394568", "AffiliationID": "60010569, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast, Institute of Clinical Sciences"}}}
