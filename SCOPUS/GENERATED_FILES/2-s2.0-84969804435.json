We perform a phase-space analysis, in which we identify specific features caused by the field inhomogeneity. We compute high-order-harmonic spectra using the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and provide an interpretation in terms of classical electron trajectories. We show that the dynamics of the system can be described by the interplay of high-frequency and slow-frequency oscillations, which are given by Mathieu's equations. The latter oscillations lead to an increase in the cutoff energy, and, for small values of the inhomogeneity parameter, take place over many driving-field cycles. In this case, the two processes can be decoupled and the oscillations can be described analytically.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Different time scale", "Electron trajectories", "Field inhomogeneity", "Frequency oscillations", "High order harmonic generation", "High order harmonics", "Inhomogeneous media", "Phase-space analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969804435", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"24482504800": {"Name": "Zagoya C.", "AuthorID": "24482504800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57189362439": {"Name": "Bonner M.", "AuthorID": "57189362439", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57189368418": {"Name": "Chomet H.", "AuthorID": "57189368418", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57214573190": {"Name": "Slade E.", "AuthorID": "57214573190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8557426100": {"Name": "Figueira De Morisson Faria C.", "AuthorID": "8557426100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
