The extent of any existing cohorts investigating these outcomes in LMIC has not previously been described. Methods We performed a systematic literature review to identify population cohort studies of adolescents in LMIC that assessed anthropometry and any of cardiovascular risk (blood pressure, physical activity, plasma glucose/lipid profile and substance misuse), puberty (age at menarche, Tanner staging, or other form of pubertal staging) or cognitive outcomes. Studies that recruited participants on the basis of a pre-existing condition or involved less than 500 young people were excluded. Findings 1829 studies were identified, and 24 cohorts fulfilled inclusion criteria based in Asia (10), Africa (6) and South / Central America (8). 14 (58%) of cohorts identified were based in one of four countries; India, Brazil, Vietnam or Ethiopia. Only 2 cohorts included a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, tanner pubertal staging, and cognitive outcomes. Conclusion Improved utilisation of existing datasets and additional cohort studies of adolescents in LMIC that collect contemporaneous measures of growth, cognition, cardiovascular risk and pubertal development are needed to better understand how this period of the life course influences future non-communicable disease morbidity and cognitive outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Brazil", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Ethiopia", "Female", "Growth", "Humans", "India", "Male", "Puberty", "Vietnam"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040590450", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189990192": {"Name": "Ward J.L.", "AuthorID": "57189990192", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57200278059": {"Name": "Harrison K.", "AuthorID": "57200278059", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University CollegeLondon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health (MCA) World Health Organization"}, "22234232400": {"Name": "Heys M.", "AuthorID": "22234232400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
