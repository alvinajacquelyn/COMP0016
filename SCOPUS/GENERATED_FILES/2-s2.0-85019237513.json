Brain Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society of NeuropathologyTo assess the clinical relevance of transgenic and patient-derived xenograft models of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high resolution post-mortem microcomputed tomography (\u03bc-CT), with correlation with histology and human ACP imaging. The growth patterns and radiological features of tumors arising in Hesx1Cre/+;Ctnnb1lox(ex3)/+ transgenic mice, and of patient-derived ACP xenografts implanted in the cerebral cortex, were monitored longitudinally in vivo with anatomical and functional MRI, and by ex vivo \u03bc-CT at study end. Pathological correlates with hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were investigated. Early enlargement and heterogeneity of Hesx1Cre/+;Ctnnb1lox(ex3)/+ mouse pituitaries was evident at initial imaging at 8 weeks, which was followed by enlargement of a solid tumor, and development of cysts and hemorrhage. Tumors demonstrated MRI features that recapitulated those of human ACP, specifically, T1-weighted signal enhancement in the solid tumor component following Gd-DTPA administration, and in some animals, hyperintense cysts on FLAIR and T1-weighted images. Ex vivo \u03bc-CT correlated with MRI findings and identified smaller cysts, which were confirmed by histology. Characteristic histological features, including wet keratin and calcification, were visible on \u03bc-CT and verified by histological sections of patient-derived ACP xenografts. The Hesx1Cre/+;Ctnnb1lox(ex3)/+ transgenic mouse model and cerebral patient-derived ACP xenografts recapitulate a number of the key radiological features of the human disease and provide promising foundations for in vivo trials of novel therapeutics for the treatment of these tumors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma", "genetically engineered mouse models", "magnetic resonance imaging", "microcomputed tomography", "patient-derived xenografts"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "beta Catenin", "Craniopharyngioma", "Disease Models, Animal", "Heterografts", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice, Transgenic", "Middle Aged", "Repressor Proteins", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019237513", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23487963100": {"Name": "Boult J.K.R.", "AuthorID": "23487963100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7402674201": {"Name": "Robinson S.P.", "AuthorID": "7402674201", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57079790300": {"Name": "Apps J.R.", "AuthorID": "57079790300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55787719000": {"Name": "Carreno G.", "AuthorID": "55787719000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603565499": {"Name": "Martinez-Barbera J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603565499", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "16245069900": {"Name": "H\u00f6lsken A.", "AuthorID": "16245069900", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "6602794488": {"Name": "Buslei R.", "AuthorID": "6602794488", "AffiliationID": "100727898", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pathology, Sozialstiftung Bamberg"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56387646400": {"Name": "Virasami A.K.", "AuthorID": "56387646400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56404353000": {"Name": "Danielson L.S.", "AuthorID": "56404353000", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Sciences, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57189505729": {"Name": "Smith L.M.", "AuthorID": "57189505729", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Sciences, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "36008728200": {"Name": "Koers A.", "AuthorID": "36008728200", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Sciences, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6603378797": {"Name": "Chesler L.", "AuthorID": "6603378797", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Sciences, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "8397787400": {"Name": "B\u00e4uerle T.", "AuthorID": "8397787400", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Radiology, Preclinical Imaging Platform Erlangen (PIPE), University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "7006941664": {"Name": "Buchfelder M.", "AuthorID": "7006941664", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}}}
