Setting Four large UK-based cohort studies. Participants Those providing valid salivary or serum cortisol samples (n=7515 for morning cortisol; n=1612 for cortisol awakening response) at baseline (age 44-82) and well-being data on the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale at follow-up (0-8 years) were included. Results Well-being was not associated with morning cortisol, diurnal slope or awakening response though a borderline association with evening cortisol was found. Adjusting for sex and follow-up time, each 1 SD increase in evening cortisol was associated with a \u00e2'0.47 (95% CI \u00e2'1.00 to 0.05) point lower well-being. This was attenuated by adjustment for body mass index, smoking and socioeconomic position. Between-study heterogeneity was low. Conclusions This study does not support the hypothesis that diurnal cortisol is prospectively associated with well-being up to 8 years later. However, replication in prospective studies with cortisol samples over multiple days is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["individual participant data", "meta-analysis", "positive psychology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Circadian Rhythm", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031322469", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005374676": {"Name": "Stafford M.", "AuthorID": "7005374676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "35354537000": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "35354537000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7006649063": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "7006649063", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "36041345700": {"Name": "Cooper C.", "AuthorID": "36041345700", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "7102850916": {"Name": "Gale C.", "AuthorID": "7102850916", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7401638539": {"Name": "Gardner M.P.", "AuthorID": "7401638539", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "14422060000": {"Name": "Geoffroy M.C.", "AuthorID": "14422060000", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}, "57203229564": {"Name": "Power C.", "AuthorID": "57203229564", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
