However, sound is an important component of the users\u2019 experience and quality of life in these spaces, and particularly in nursing homes, where both staff and residents have medium- to long-term perspectives, contrarily to hospital settings. This study included an online large-scale survey for nursing homes in Flanders and it targeted the group of professionals. It aimed at providing an overview about noise sensitivity and sound perception of the staff members in their work environment, as well as investigating the potential effects on sound perception of staff role and context. Results showed that limited differences emerged for staff roles, while more differences were found when exploring the context factor. Overall, the results of this study claim for further attention on the management and design of the sound environment in these facilities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Indoor soundscape", "long-term care", "noise sensitivity", "sound perception", "sound quality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Long term care", "Noise sensitivity", "Sound perception", "Sound Quality", "Soundscapes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043579164", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55557756700": {"Name": "Aletta F.", "AuthorID": "55557756700", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "55457923800": {"Name": "Thomas P.", "AuthorID": "55457923800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "56529687700": {"Name": "Filipan K.", "AuthorID": "56529687700", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "6701666696": {"Name": "Botteldooren D.", "AuthorID": "6701666696", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "56985576800": {"Name": "Devos P.", "AuthorID": "56985576800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "57200661329": {"Name": "Vander Mynsbrugge T.", "AuthorID": "57200661329", "AffiliationID": "60017815", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Therapy, Artevelde University College Ghent"}, "36968854500": {"Name": "Van de Velde D.", "AuthorID": "36968854500", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, Ghent University"}, "35188672900": {"Name": "De Vriendt P.", "AuthorID": "35188672900", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Department Gerontology and Frailty in Ageing, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}}}
