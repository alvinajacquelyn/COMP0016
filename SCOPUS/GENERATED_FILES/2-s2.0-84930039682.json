Design Retrospective case series. Participants Twenty-five children 2 to 15 years of age diagnosed with early Coats' disease and treated after intraoperative FA. Methods Retrospective review of patients who underwent treatment for stage 2 Coats' disease in a tertiary center in the United Kingdom between 2007 and 2012. The children underwent treatment to the telangiectatic vessels and associated areas of retinal nonperfusion identified on intraoperative FA performed with a wide-angle retinal camera (RetCam II). Main Outcome Measures Anatomic and structural assessment of the retina after treatment, visual acuity (VA), and complications related to treatment. Results Twenty children with Coats' disease who underwent intraoperative RetCam FA and retinal ablative treatment and who had more than 3 months of follow-up were identified from clinical records. All had unilateral disease. Six eyes were classified as stage 2a, and 14 eyes were classified as stage 2b. The median duration of follow-up was 21 months (mean, 26 months). Fifteen eyes needed 1 treatment to stabilize the disease, and 5 eyes needed a second treatment. None of the patients demonstrated progression of the disease to a more severe stage. Twelve eyes had a final VA of 0.4 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better, 6 patients had VA between 0.4 and 1.0 logMAR, and 2 patients had VA worse than 1.0 logMAR. Conclusions The treatment of retinal telangiectasia and areas of retinal nonperfusion identified by wide-angle intraoperative FA in children with stage 2 Coats' disease led to good anatomic outcome, with preservation of VA in most cases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cryotherapy", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Intraoperative Period", "Laser Coagulation", "Lasers, Solid-State", "Male", "Retinal Telangiectasis", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930039682", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36164722600": {"Name": "Suzani M.", "AuthorID": "36164722600", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco"}}}
