We primarily study the case of an average filling of one boson per site. In agreement with bosonization theory, we show that the ground state of the system in the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the Pfaffian-like state when the system is tuned towards the superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase transition. Our study clarifies the possibility of the creation of exotic Pfaffian-like states in realistic one-dimensional systems. We also present preliminary evidence that such states support non-Abelian anyonic excitations that have potential application for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960192582", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55372421800": {"Name": "Duri\u0107 T.", "AuthorID": "55372421800", "AffiliationID": "60021361", "AffiliationName": "Instytut Fizyki Im.
