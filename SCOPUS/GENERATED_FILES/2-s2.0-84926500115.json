All rights reserved.Objectives: To investigate the extent to which variation exists in the initiation rate of statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease between countries of the UK and between different regions within England. Design: Cohort study using data from a large UK primary care database. Setting: UK. Participants: 4 820 885 individuals from 554 general practices during the period 2004-2012. Main outcome measures: Rate of statin therapy initiation per 1000 person-years. Results: Relative to a fixed English rate of 1 initiation per 1000 person-years and accounting for gender, age and social deprivation level, the rate was similar for Scotland at 0.92 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.00) and rates for Northern Ireland and Wales were higher at 1.40 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.62) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.32), respectively. Within England, the regions could be classified into three groups with respect to statin therapy initiation rates (relative to a rate of 1 initiation per 1000 person-years for London): the South Central 0.73 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.83), South West 0.80 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91), East of England 0.81 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.94) and South East Coast 0.83 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.95); strategic health authorities had similar low rates followed by the East Midlands 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.05), West Midlands 0.96 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.09), North East 0.96 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.16), Yorkshire and Humber 0.97 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.17) and London strategic health authorities. North West England exhibited the highest rate of statin therapy initiation of 1.16 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.31). Conclusions: Considerable variation in the rate of statin therapy initiation was observed between the four countries of the UK and between different geographical regions within England.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Drug Prescriptions", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Male", "Northern Ireland", "Primary Health Care", "Primary Prevention", "Scotland", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926500115", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"52164155000": {"Name": "O'Keeffe A.", "AuthorID": "52164155000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
