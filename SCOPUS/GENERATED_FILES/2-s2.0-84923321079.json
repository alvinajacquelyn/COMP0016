Materials and methods A database was used to identify suitable mCRPC patients. Staging CT images were retrospectively reviewed for signs preceding MSCC. Signs of malignant paravertebral fat infiltration and epidural soft-tissue disease were defined and assessed on serial CT in 34 patients with MSCC and 58 control patients. The presence and evolution of the features were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results In MSCC patients, CT performed a median of 28 days prior to the diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated significant epidural soft tissue in 28 (80%) patients. The median time to MSCC from a combination of overt malignant paravertebral and epidural disease was 2.7 (0-14.6) months. Conversely, these signs were uncommon in the control cohort. Conclusions Significant malignant paravertebral and/or epidural disease at CT precede MSCC in up to 80% of mCRPC patients and should prompt closer patient follow-up and consideration of early MRI evaluation. These CT-based features require further prospective validation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant", "Retrospective Studies", "Spinal Cord Compression", "Spinal Cord Neoplasms", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923321079", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"24401739300": {"Name": "Pezaro C.", "AuthorID": "24401739300", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22035377200": {"Name": "Omlin A.", "AuthorID": "22035377200", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56407039900": {"Name": "Perez-Lopez R.", "AuthorID": "56407039900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26650173700": {"Name": "Mukherji D.", "AuthorID": "26650173700", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9740870900": {"Name": "Attard G.", "AuthorID": "9740870900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193818825": {"Name": "Bianchini D.", "AuthorID": "57193818825", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55944529300": {"Name": "Lorente D.", "AuthorID": "55944529300", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402174556": {"Name": "Parker C.", "AuthorID": "7402174556", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004428943": {"Name": "Dearnaley D.", "AuthorID": "7004428943", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003906526": {"Name": "De Bono J.S.", "AuthorID": "7003906526", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23104280100": {"Name": "Sohaib A.", "AuthorID": "23104280100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8639840600": {"Name": "Tunariu N.", "AuthorID": "8639840600", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology Department, Academic Urology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
