Here we describe 14 genome sequences of M. tuberculosis, representing 12 distinct genotypes, obtained from human remains from eighteenth-century Hungary using metagenomics. All our historic genotypes belong to M. tuberculosis Lineage 4. Bayesian phylogenetic dating, based on samples with well-documented dates, places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. We find that most bodies yielded more than one M. tuberculosis genotype and we document an intimate epidemiological link between infections in two long-dead individuals. Our results suggest that metagenomic approaches usefully inform detection and characterization of historical and contemporary infections.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bayes Theorem", "Coinfection", "DNA, Bacterial", "Europe", "Female", "Genome, Bacterial", "Genotype", "History, 18th Century", "Humans", "Hungary", "Male", "Metagenomics", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Phylogeny", "Tuberculosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926633115", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56396241400": {"Name": "Kay G.", "AuthorID": "56396241400", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "6602649951": {"Name": "Sergeant M.", "AuthorID": "6602649951", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57201245733": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57201245733", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "54895585300": {"Name": "Chan J.", "AuthorID": "54895585300", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7005085267": {"Name": "Millard A.", "AuthorID": "7005085267", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7006051116": {"Name": "Achtman M.", "AuthorID": "7006051116", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7005883114": {"Name": "Pallen M.", "AuthorID": "7005883114", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational and Systems Medicine, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "55644213500": {"Name": "Quick J.", "AuthorID": "55644213500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "6701414703": {"Name": "Loman N.", "AuthorID": "6701414703", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "6506973016": {"Name": "Szikossy I.", "AuthorID": "6506973016", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "7004366473": {"Name": "Pap I.", "AuthorID": "7004366473", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "55242127500": {"Name": "Spigelman M.", "AuthorID": "55242127500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "6701847443": {"Name": "Donoghue H.", "AuthorID": "6701847443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
