The doctors' perception of a VAS score as a good tool for evaluating AR symptom control is unknown, as is the level of AR control perceived by physicians who treat patients. Methods: 307 voluntarily selected physicians attending the annual (2013) European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) meeting completed a digital survey. Delegates were asked to (1) estimate how many AR patients/week they saw during the season, (2) estimate the proportion of patients they considered to have well-, partly- and un-controlled AR, (3) communicate how they gauged this control and (4) assess how useful they would find a VAS as a method of gauging control. 257 questionnaires were filled out completely and analysed. Results: EAACI delegates reported seeing 46.8 [standard deviation (SD) 68.5] AR patients/week during the season. They estimated that 38.7 % (SD 24.0), 34.2 % (SD 20.2) and 20.0 % (SD 16.34) of their AR patients had well-controlled (no AR symptoms), partly-controlled (some AR symptoms), or un-controlled-(moderate/severe AR symptoms) disease despite taking medication [remainder unknown (7.1 %)]. However, AR control was assessed in many ways, including symptom severity (74 %), frequency of day- and night-time symptoms (67 %), activity impairment (57 %), respiratory function monitoring (nasal and/or lung function; 40 %) and incidence of AR exacerbations (50 %). 91 % of delegates felt a simple VAS would be a useful tool to gauge AR symptom control. Conclusions: A substantial portion of patients with AR are perceived as having uncontrolled or partly controlled disease even when treated. A simple VAS score is considered a useful tool to monitor AR control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allergic rhinitis", "Control", "Digital", "Survey", "VAS", "Visual analogue scale"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006127233", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7004215789": {"Name": "Hellings P.W.", "AuthorID": "7004215789", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Academic Medical Center (AMC)"}, "35355799700": {"Name": "Fokkens W.", "AuthorID": "35355799700", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Academic Medical Center (AMC)"}, "35611705000": {"Name": "Muraro A.", "AuthorID": "35611705000", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women and Child Health, Food Allergy Referral Centre, Padua University Hospital"}, "55972415400": {"Name": "Mullol J.", "AuthorID": "55972415400", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERES"}, "7102663930": {"Name": "Bachert C.", "AuthorID": "7102663930", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Upper Airways Research Laboratory (URL), University Hospital Ghent"}, "55412658800": {"Name": "Canonica G.W.", "AuthorID": "55412658800", "AffiliationID": "60107402, 60025153, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Allergy and Respiratory Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS S Martino, IST, University of Genoa"}, "57220999295": {"Name": "Price D.", "AuthorID": "57220999295", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Academic Primary Care, University of Aberdeen"}, "35354006800": {"Name": "Papadopoulos N.", "AuthorID": "35354006800", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Allergy Department, 2nd Pediatric Clinic, University of Athens"}, "7007079421": {"Name": "Scadding G.", "AuthorID": "7007079421", "AffiliationID": "102050049", "AffiliationName": "RNTNE Hospital"}, "7003838466": {"Name": "Rasp G.", "AuthorID": "7003838466", "AffiliationID": "60014976", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Paracelsus Medical University"}, "7103273891": {"Name": "Demoly P.", "AuthorID": "7103273891", "AffiliationID": "60017438, 60031773", "AffiliationName": "Division of Allergy, Department of Pulmonology, H\u00f4pital Arnaud de Villeneuve, University Hospital of Montpellier"}, "55540389600": {"Name": "Murray R.", "AuthorID": "55540389600", "AffiliationID": "100768963", "AffiliationName": "MedScript Ltd"}, "55156315400": {"Name": "Bousquet J.", "AuthorID": "55156315400", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "UVSQ UMR-S1168, Universite Versailles St-Quentin-en-Yvelines"}}}
