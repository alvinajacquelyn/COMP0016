Early mobilization is a postoperative ERAS module that can be self-managed by patients, but poor adherence is common. Visualization is increasingly being used to improve patient understanding and adherence to health behaviors. This study tested whether an animated visualization intervention could improve adherence to postoperative mobilization. Method: Ninety six colorectal and gynecological oncology surgery patients were randomized to intervention, active control, or standard care groups. Intervention participants saw an animated intervention on a computer tablet at Day 1 postsurgery. All participants wore fitness trackers from day of discharge to 7 days postdischarge, and completed psychological measures at baseline, Day 1 postsurgery, and 7 days postdischarge. Results: Step count data was available for 57 colorectal surgery participants. A main effect of group demonstrated that intervention participants had a significantly higher average daily step count from discharge across the week following discharge (Madj = 2,294.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1,746.11, 2,744.89]) compared with control participants (Madj = 1,347.25, 95% CI [826.51, 1,871.20]; p = .05). At postsurgery, intervention participants reported significantly greater perceived quality of recovery and less difficulty in being mobile compared with control participants. There were no between-group differences in self-reported exercise or perceptions of surgery and recovery. Conclusion: This brief intervention appears effective in improving perceptions of early mobilization, and initial evidence suggests improvements in adherence to postsurgical mobilization. This intervention has high clinical applicability and could be incorporated into postoperative standard care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Early mobilization", "ERAS", "Intervention", "Visualization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Data Visualization", "Early Ambulation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070903954", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56918930900": {"Name": "Jones A.S.K.", "AuthorID": "56918930900", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "24329674000": {"Name": "Kleinst\u00e4uber M.", "AuthorID": "24329674000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "57210552622": {"Name": "Akroyd A.", "AuthorID": "57210552622", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "57210556785": {"Name": "Mittendorf A.", "AuthorID": "57210556785", "AffiliationID": "60021521", "AffiliationName": "General Surgical Service, Auckland District Health Board"}, "57210564205": {"Name": "Bognuda P.", "AuthorID": "57210564205", "AffiliationID": "60021521", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Oncology Department, National Women's Health, Auckland District Health Board"}, "57213076840": {"Name": "Eva L.", "AuthorID": "57213076840", "AffiliationID": "60021521", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Oncology Department, National Women's Health, Auckland District Health Board"}, "35577892500": {"Name": "Merrie A.E.H.", "AuthorID": "35577892500", "AffiliationID": "60021521", "AffiliationName": "General Surgical Service, Auckland District Health Board"}, "55257959900": {"Name": "Fernandez J.", "AuthorID": "55257959900", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, Faculty of Engineering, University of Auckland"}, "7006167816": {"Name": "Petrie K.J.", "AuthorID": "7006167816", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}}}
