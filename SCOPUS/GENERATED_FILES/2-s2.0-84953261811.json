American Physical Society.Mn has been found to self-assemble into atomic chains running perpendicular to the surface dimer reconstruction on Si(001). They differ from other atomic chains by a striking asymmetric appearance in filled state scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. This has prompted complicated structural models involving up to three Mn atoms per chain unit. Combining STM, atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory we find that a simple necklacelike chain of single Mn atoms reproduces all their prominent features, including their asymmetry not captured by current models. The upshot is a remarkably simpler structure for modeling the electronic and magnetic properties of Mn atom chains on Si(001).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic chains", "Chain units", "Current models", "Electronic and magnetic properties", "Prominent features", "Self-assemble", "Structural models", "Surface dimers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953261811", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"37119549100": {"Name": "Villarreal R.", "AuthorID": "37119549100", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter Physics, University of Geneva"}, "7004656517": {"Name": "Longobardi M.", "AuthorID": "7004656517", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter Physics, University of Geneva"}, "55750374200": {"Name": "K\u00f6ster S.A.", "AuthorID": "55750374200", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter Physics, University of Geneva"}, "35509117400": {"Name": "Renner C.", "AuthorID": "35509117400", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter Physics, University of Geneva"}, "55328551700": {"Name": "Kirkham C.J.", "AuthorID": "55328551700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006156424": {"Name": "Bowler D.", "AuthorID": "7006156424", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
