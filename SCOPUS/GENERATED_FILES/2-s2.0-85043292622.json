Our research takes a macroscopic, systemic view of an entire state's high school-to-postsecondary engineering pathway to understand how each high school performs in terms of having its students from underrepresented groups who fit an engineering academic profile actually choose to enroll in an engineering postsecondary program. We frame our research holistically to understand how the variety of potential gatekeepers - including the people, places, programs, and policies - might be positioned, tweaked, or trained to support a more diverse population of students who choose to enroll in postsecondary engineering programs. This mixed-methods research design is organized into three sequential phases and will be grounded theoretically using Social Cognitive Career Theory to guide variable identification and qualitative protocol development. We are currently in Phase 1 and will describe preliminary results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Broadening participation", "Data analytics", "Engineering pathway"], "IndexKeywords": ["Broadening participation", "Data analytics", "Engineering program", "Mixed-methods research", "Protocol development", "Social cognitive career theory", "Systemic views", "Under-represented groups"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043292622", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57201061398": {"Name": "Gillen A.", "AuthorID": "57201061398", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech."}, "56300949800": {"Name": "Kinoshita T.", "AuthorID": "56300949800", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech."}, "57210745089": {"Name": "Knight D.", "AuthorID": "57210745089", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech."}, "56763780800": {"Name": "Grohs J.", "AuthorID": "56763780800", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech."}, "55336563600": {"Name": "Carrico C.", "AuthorID": "55336563600", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech."}, "24492167900": {"Name": "Matusovich H.", "AuthorID": "24492167900", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech."}, "6505829810": {"Name": "Bradburn I.", "AuthorID": "6505829810", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Center for Learning and Research, Virginia Tech."}, "57201055285": {"Name": "Tan L.", "AuthorID": "57201055285", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Development, Virginia Tech."}}}
