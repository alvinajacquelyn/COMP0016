Both the undoped and interstitial boron-doped TiO2 thin films showed photoactivity under UV irradiation, with the boron-doped thin films presenting higher photodegradation rates when compared to the undoped samples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric pressure plasmas", "Boron doped anatase", "Functional oxides", "Interstitial boron", "Photodegradation rate", "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)", "Temperature sensitive", "Temperature sensitive substrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021712775", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57191366242": {"Name": "Quesada-Gonz\u00e1lez M.", "AuthorID": "57191366242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55314997800": {"Name": "Baba K.", "AuthorID": "55314997800", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Research and Technology, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "7003947764": {"Name": "Choquet P.", "AuthorID": "7003947764", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Research and Technology, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "12139371400": {"Name": "Boscher N.", "AuthorID": "12139371400", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Research and Technology, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "56119704200": {"Name": "Sotelo-V\u00e1zquez C.", "AuthorID": "56119704200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
