While such capacity deteriorates with age in mammals, it remains intact in species such as salamanders, which have an extensive repertoire of regeneration and can undergo multiple episodes through their lifespan. Here we show that, surprisingly, there is a significant induction of cellular senescence during salamander limb regeneration, but that rapid and effective mechanisms of senescent cell clearance operate in normal and regenerating tissues. Furthermore, the number of senescent cells does not increase upon repetitive amputation or ageing, in contrast to mammals. Finally, we identify the macrophage as a critical player in this efficient senescent cell clearance mechanism. We propose that effective immunosurveillance of senescent cells in salamanders supports their ability to undergo regeneration throughout their lifespan.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Bystander Effect", "Cell Aging", "Cell Death", "Cell Proliferation", "Extremities", "Immunologic Surveillance", "Macrophages", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Phagocytosis", "Primary Cell Culture", "Regeneration", "Urodela", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930682376", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55901896500": {"Name": "Yun M.", "AuthorID": "55901896500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7006470776": {"Name": "Brockes J.", "AuthorID": "7006470776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "56319160300": {"Name": "Davaapil H.", "AuthorID": "56319160300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
