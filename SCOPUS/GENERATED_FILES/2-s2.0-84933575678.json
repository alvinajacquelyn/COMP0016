Polymers incorporated with methylene blue (MB) and 2 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are effective in killing bacteria at the surface following low power visible illumination. Studies of medical-grade silicone polymer samples including segments from urinary catheters were carried out to investigate the generation of reactive oxygen species and the involvement of Type 1 and 2 mechanisms. Singlet oxygen was observed using direct phosphorescence detection and hydroxyl radical generation using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy; we conclude that both Type 1 and 2 mechanisms can operate with polymeric photosensitisation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) directly demonstrated the incorporation of AuNPs at the surface of the silicone. Using silicone doped with MB AuNPs, a \u22653log10 reduction in the number of viable Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria was achieved when exposed to low power laser light; prior sterilisation with ethylene oxide (EO) had no influence on efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical application", "Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy", "Gold nanoparticle", "Hydroxyl radical generation", "Photosensitisation", "Reactive oxygen species", "Staphylococcus epidermidis", "Urinary tract infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933575678", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"36874170300": {"Name": "Bovis M.J.", "AuthorID": "36874170300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "6602368084": {"Name": "Woodhams J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602368084", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55659162000": {"Name": "Peveler W.J.", "AuthorID": "55659162000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202827051": {"Name": "Kay C.W.M.", "AuthorID": "7202827051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, London Centre of Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55274495600": {"Name": "Weiner J.", "AuthorID": "55274495600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "55869165300": {"Name": "Correia A.", "AuthorID": "55869165300", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "55547112955": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "55547112955", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
