This analysis is time-consuming, relatively expensive, and delays in diagnosis and inappropriate treatment can occur if not pursued early in the diagnostic work-up. We reviewed testing outcomes of Sanger sequencing in 200 consecutive patient samples referred for analysis. In addition, the Illumina Tru-seq custom amplicon system was evaluated for paralleled next-generation sequencing (NGS) of AGXT, GRHPR, and HOGA1 in 90 known PH patients. AGXT sequencing was requested in all patients, permitting a diagnosis of PH1 in 50%. All remaining patients underwent targeted exon sequencing of GRHPR and HOGA1 with 8% diagnosed with PH2 and 8% with PH3. Complete sequencing of both GRHPR and HOGA1 was not requested in 25% of patients referred leaving their diagnosis in doubt. NGS analysis showed 98% agreement with Sanger sequencing and both approaches had 100% diagnostic specificity. Diagnostic sensitivity of Sanger sequencing was 98% and for NGS it was 97%. NGS has comparable diagnostic performance to Sanger sequencing for the diagnosis of PH and, if implemented, would screen for all forms of PH simultaneously ensuring prompt diagnosis at decreased cost.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetic diagnosis", "Next generation sequencing", "Oxalate", "Primary Hyperoxaluria"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930160817", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57217283977": {"Name": "Williams E.L.", "AuthorID": "57217283977", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare"}, "24167822000": {"Name": "Bagg E.A.L.", "AuthorID": "24167822000", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare"}, "56763392100": {"Name": "Mueller M.", "AuthorID": "56763392100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genome Informatics Facility, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "16033551800": {"Name": "Vandrovcova J.", "AuthorID": "16033551800", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "26643597700": {"Name": "Aitman T.J.", "AuthorID": "26643597700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006099271": {"Name": "Rumsby G.", "AuthorID": "7006099271", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospitals"}}}
