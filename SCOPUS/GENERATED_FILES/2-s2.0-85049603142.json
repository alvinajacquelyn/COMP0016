Here, we address the choice of database and adjustments for population structure and sample size in the context of Brazil. The Brazilian population underwent a complex process of colonization, migration and mating, which created an admixed genetic composition that makes it difficult to obtain an appropriate database for a given case. National databases are now available, as well as databases for many Brazilian states. However, those databases are not statistically random samples, and state boundaries may not accurately reflect the sub-structuring of genetic diversity. We compared the LR calculated using the relevant state-specific database with the statistics calculated when a national database and when international databases were used. We evaluated two methods of adjustment for population structure, due to Wright [13] and Balding and Nichols [14]. We also considered two adjustments for database sample size: the Balding size bias correction [15] and a minimum allele frequency [16]. Our results show that the use of a national database with the Balding and Nichols adjustment and \u03b8 = 0.002 generated lower LR values than did the state-specific database in more than 50% of the profiles simulated using the state-based allele frequencies, while \u03b8 = 0.01 produced lower LRs for more than 90% of the profiles. We conclude that the utilization of a national database for Brazilian cases can be justified in association with the appropriate adjustment for population structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "DNA database", "Human identification", "Likelihood ratio", "Population structure", "Theta correction", "Wright's F coefficients"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brazil", "Databases, Nucleic Acid", "DNA Fingerprinting", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Population", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Microsatellite Repeats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049603142", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56433467600": {"Name": "Hessab T.", "AuthorID": "56433467600", "AffiliationID": "114786713", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Pesquisa e Per\u00edcias em Gen\u00e9tica Forense, DGPTC/PCERJ"}, "8701825100": {"Name": "Schrago C.", "AuthorID": "8701825100", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Gen\u00e9tica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"}, "57202853990": {"Name": "Aranha R.", "AuthorID": "57202853990", "AffiliationID": "60069326", "AffiliationName": "Escola de Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas"}, "6602768484": {"Name": "Moura-Neto R.", "AuthorID": "6602768484", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"}, "7004169857": {"Name": "Balding D.", "AuthorID": "7004169857", "AffiliationID": "60118644, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Integrative Genomics, School of BioSciences and School of Mathematics & Statistics, The University of Melbourne"}}}
