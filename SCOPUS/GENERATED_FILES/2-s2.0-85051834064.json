However, the authors maintain that these types of attacks indirectly renders a number of unexpected behaviours in the system that can be profiled. In this work, the authors present CoME, an anomaly-based methodology aiming at detecting software exploitation in Android systems. CoME models the normal behaviour of a given software component or service and it is capable of identifying any unanticipated behaviour. To this end, they first monitor the normal operation of a given exploitable component through lightweight virtual introspection. Then, they use a multivariate analysis approach to estimate the normality model and detect anomalies. They evaluate their system against one of the most critical vulnerable and widely exploited services in Android, i.e. the mediaserver. Results show that the proposed approach can not only provide a meaningful explanatory of discriminant features for illegitimate activities, but can also be used to accurately detect malicious software exploitations at runtime.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Android systems", "Exploratory analysis", "Media servers", "Multivariate analysis approaches", "Normal operations", "Runtimes", "Software component", "Software vulnerabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051834064", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"42662353700": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Tangil G.", "AuthorID": "42662353700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57192250213": {"Name": "Dash S.", "AuthorID": "57192250213", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6507688555": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Teodoro P.", "AuthorID": "6507688555", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "NESG - Department of Signal Theory, Telematics and Communications, University of Granada, ETSIIT-CITIC"}, "35363432300": {"Name": "Camacho J.", "AuthorID": "35363432300", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "NESG - Department of Signal Theory, Telematics and Communications, University of Granada, ETSIIT-CITIC"}, "56228032600": {"Name": "Cavallaro L.", "AuthorID": "56228032600", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "S2Lab - Information Security Group, Royal Holloway University of London"}}}
