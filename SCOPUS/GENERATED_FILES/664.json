Our mirror substrate consists of a carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) core encapsulated in a thick (50\u00b5m) coating of nickel; the coating entirely covers the CFRP front, back and edges. The benefits of CFRP are: that it has high tensile strength, making it exceptionally resistant to breakage and able to withstand high inter-actuator forces; that it can be fabricated in large sections, allowing the production of a 2.6 m monolithic mirror, simplifying system control and eliminating additional diffraction/scattering introduced by segmented mirror systems; its low density (< 1800 kgm\u22123 for a Ni coated substrate). By the end of summer this year (2009) we aim to have constructed a 19 cm diameter fully actuated (37 piezo-stack actuators on a 29 mm triangular grid) prototype and a 1.0 m diameter substrate mounted on a static set of points to demonstrate the scalability of the technology. We discuss the processes involved in forming a Ni-CFRP mirror, the results obtained so far and a current status update.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative substrates", "Coated substrates", "Current projects", "Extremely Large Telescopes", "High-tensile strength", "Large deformable mirrors", "Monolithic mirrors", "Piezo stack actuator"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084637444", "SubjectAreas": [["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"10042560200": {"Name": "Thompson S.J.", "AuthorID": "10042560200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, University College London"}, "6506833394": {"Name": "Doel P.", "AuthorID": "6506833394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, University College London"}, "7403482947": {"Name": "Brooks D.", "AuthorID": "7403482947", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, University College London"}, "57204303519": {"Name": "Strangwood M.", "AuthorID": "57204303519", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham"}}}
