Investigating the family origins of stressors may provide promising avenues for identifying and intervening with children at risk for the onset of anxiety disorders and their families. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of parent-dependent negative life events and chronic adversities experienced by children with an anxiety disorder (n = 34) in the 12 months prior to the onset of the child\u2019s most recent episode, compared to healthy controls (n = 34). Life events and chronic adversities were assessed using maternal report during an investigator-based interview, which provided independent panel ratings of the extent that reported experiences were related to parent behaviour. There were no group differences in the number of parent-dependent negative life events for anxious children compared to controls. However, significantly more parent-dependent chronic adversities were present for anxious children compared to controls. Findings suggest that parents contribute to an increased frequency of chronic adversities but not negative life events prior to their child\u2019s most recent onset of anxiety. Furthermore, increased child exposure to parent-dependent chronic adversities was related to parental history of mental disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child anxiety", "Chronic adversity", "Life events", "Parent psychopathology", "Stress", "Stress generation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anxiety Disorders", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Parents", "Psychopathology", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027055762", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16678382400": {"Name": "Allen J.L.", "AuthorID": "16678382400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57188657138": {"Name": "Chhoa C.Y.", "AuthorID": "57188657138", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57203056370": {"Name": "Sandberg S.", "AuthorID": "57203056370", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "7004179964": {"Name": "Fearn T.", "AuthorID": "7004179964", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7007161151": {"Name": "Rapee R.M.", "AuthorID": "7007161151", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Emotional Health, Macquarie University"}}}
