Over half of these individuals will develop diabetic retinopathy, representing a nearly insurmountable burden for providing diabetes eye care. Telemedicine programmes have the capability to distribute quality eye care to virtually any location and address the lack of access to ophthalmic services. In most programmes, there is currently a heavy reliance on specially trained retinal image graders, a resource in short supply worldwide. These factors necessitate an image grading automation process to increase the speed of retinal image evaluation while maintaining accuracy and cost effectiveness. Several automatic retinal image analysis systems designed for use in telemedicine have recently become commercially available. Such systems have the potential to substantially improve the manner by which diabetes eye care is delivered by providing automated real-time evaluation to expedite diagnosis and referral if required. Furthermore, integration with electronic medical records may allow a more accurate prognostication for individual patients and may provide predictive modelling of medical risk factors based on broad population data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated retinal image analysis", "Diabetes mellitus", "Diabetic retinopathy", "Telemedicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automation", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mass Screening", "Retina", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923683412", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.A.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7006805543": {"Name": "Aiello L.P.", "AuthorID": "7006805543", "AffiliationID": "60003872, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School and Beetham Eye Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center"}, "28568171600": {"Name": "Silva P.S.", "AuthorID": "28568171600", "AffiliationID": "60071495, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Teleophthalmology and Image Reading Center, Philippine Eye Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, University of the Philippines"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.A.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
