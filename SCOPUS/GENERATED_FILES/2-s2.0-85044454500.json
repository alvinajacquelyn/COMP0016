Both Inflammation and ER stress are critical processes in the delayed death of the cells damaged after ischemia. The aim of this study is to check the putative synergic neuroprotective effect by combining anti-inflammatory and anti-ER stress agents after ischemia. Methods: The study was performed on a two-vessel occlusion global cerebral ischemia model. Animals were treated with salubrinal one hour after ischemia and with robenacoxib at 8 h and 32 h after ischemia. Parameters related to the integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 and different cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), were analyzed by qPCR at 24 h and 48 h after ischemia. Microglia and cell components of the neurovascular unit, including neurons, endothelial cells and astrocytes, were analyzed by immunofluorescence after 48 h and seven days of reperfusion. Results: Pharmacologic control of ER stress by salubrinal treatment after ischemia, revealed a neuroprotective effect over neurons that reduces the transcription of molecules involved in the impairment of the BBB. Robenacoxib treatment stepped neuronal demise forward, revealing a detrimental effect of this anti-inflammatory agent. Combined treatment with robenacoxib and salubrinal after ischemia prevented neuronal loss and changes in components of the neurovascular unit and microglia observed when animals were treated only with robenacoxib. Conclusion: Combined treatment with anti-ER stress and anti-inflammatory agents is able to provide enhanced neuroprotective effects reducing glial activation, which opens new avenues in therapies against stroke.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood\u2013brain barrier", "COX-2 inhibitor", "ER stress", "Inflammation", "Microglia", "Salubrinal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain Ischemia", "Cinnamates", "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors", "Diphenylamine", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Inflammation", "Male", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Phenylacetates", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Thiourea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044454500", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56150728300": {"Name": "Anuncibay-Soto B.", "AuthorID": "56150728300", "AffiliationID": "60020657", "AffiliationName": "Dpt.
