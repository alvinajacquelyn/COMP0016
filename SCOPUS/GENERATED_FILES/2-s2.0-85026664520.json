Nonetheless, despite effective cART, HIV-1 persists indefinitely in infected individuals. Clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells in peripheral blood has been reported recently. cART is effective in stopping the retroviral replication cycle, but not in inhibiting clonal expansion of the infected host cells. Thus, the proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells may play a role in viral persistence, but little is known about the kinetics of the generation, the tissue distribution or the underlying mechanism of clonal expansion in vivo. Here we analyzed the clonality of HIV-1-infected cells using high-throughput integration site analysis in a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model. Clonally expanded, HIV-1-infected cells were detectable at two weeks post infection, their abundance increased with time, and certain clones were present in multiple organs. Expansion of HIV-1-infected clones was significantly more frequent when the provirus was integrated near host genes in specific gene ontological classes, including cell activation and chromatin regulation. These results identify potential drivers of clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Clone Cells", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "RNA, Viral", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Tissue Distribution", "Viral Load", "Virus Integration", "Virus Latency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026664520", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7007102471": {"Name": "Satou Y.", "AuthorID": "7007102471", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Priority Organization for Innovation and Excellence, Kumamoto University"}, "24076593200": {"Name": "Katsuya H.", "AuthorID": "24076593200", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University"}, "57188725906": {"Name": "Fukuda A.", "AuthorID": "57188725906", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Priority Organization for Innovation and Excellence, Kumamoto University"}, "15045372700": {"Name": "Miyazato P.", "AuthorID": "15045372700", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University"}, "57207049587": {"Name": "Islam S.", "AuthorID": "57207049587", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University"}, "7005393735": {"Name": "Misawa N.", "AuthorID": "7005393735", "AffiliationID": "60119774, 60011001", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Virology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University"}, "55514295600": {"Name": "Koyanagi Y.", "AuthorID": "55514295600", "AffiliationID": "60119774, 60011001", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Virology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University"}, "7406412392": {"Name": "Sato K.", "AuthorID": "7406412392", "AffiliationID": "60015682", "AffiliationName": "CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency"}, "55898709600": {"Name": "Ito J.", "AuthorID": "55898709600", "AffiliationID": "60019226", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Genetics, Department of Integrated Genetics, National Institute of Genetics"}, "16176419600": {"Name": "Uchiyama Y.", "AuthorID": "16176419600", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University"}, "6701807360": {"Name": "Fassati A.", "AuthorID": "6701807360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "38461415000": {"Name": "Melamed A.", "AuthorID": "38461415000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}, "7006379558": {"Name": "Bangham C.", "AuthorID": "7006379558", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}}}
