Material and Methods Data were collected from 21 male patients with complete or partial CUR who underwent two-stage SNM between 2006 and 2014. The implanted lead was connected to a temporary battery (stage-1) and they were assessed over a period of 3-12 weeks. Those who had a residual volume of \u2264100 mL, had an implantable pulse generator sited (stage-2). Patients were followed up at 3 and 6 months initially, and 12 monthly thereafter. The following parameters were analyzed: age, onset of symptoms, precipitant causes for CUR, type of retention, associated voiding dysfunction and opiate intake. Results Surgery was the main precipitating cause of CUR in 5 (24%) patients. Stage-1 SNM restored complete efficient voiding in 14 patients (66.7%) out of the 21 patients. The only parameter studied that showed a positive correlation with a successful outcome to SNM was the age of the patient, with a higher success rate in younger males (median age 37 years [p = 0.025]). There was no other significant finding when looking at other parameters studied. Stage-2 was carried out in 13 out of 14 successful stage-1 patients. SNM restored complete voiding or improved bladder emptying in all patients implanted with a battery, and this was sustained until the battery needed to be replaced with a mean follow up of 34 \u00b1 23.7 months except in two cases that had removal after traumatic accidents. Conclusion Stage-1 SNM was successful in 66.7% of male patients with CUR. Once stage-2 was performed, successful voiding was maintained until the battery needed to be replaced. SNM success was better in men under a median age of 43 years. Further studies are encouraged to study this group of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic urinary retention", "male", "outcomes", "sacral neuromodulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Chronic Disease", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Sacrum", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Retention", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930277995", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"56512389600": {"Name": "Saber-Khalaf M.", "AuthorID": "56512389600", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56086721100": {"Name": "Abtahi B.", "AuthorID": "56086721100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15623104100": {"Name": "Gonzales G.", "AuthorID": "15623104100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57197251869": {"Name": "Helal M.", "AuthorID": "57197251869", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "12775353100": {"Name": "Elneil S.", "AuthorID": "12775353100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
