To better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of WMHs among older adults, this study examined in vivo cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of \u03b2-amyloid42 deposition (A\u03b242), hyperphosphorylated tau pathology, neurodegeneration (total tau), and axonal injury (neurofilament light [NFL]) in relation to log-transformed WMHs volume. Participants free of clinical stroke and dementia were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project (n = 148, 72 \u00b1 6 years). Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, intracranial volume, modified Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (excluding points assigned for age), cognitive diagnosis, and APOE-\u03b54 carrier status. A\u03b242 (\u03b2 = \u22120.001, p = 0.007) and NFL (\u03b2 = 0.0003, p = 0.01) concentrations related to WMHs but neither hyperphosphorylated tau nor total tau associations with WMHs reached statistical significance (p-values > 0.21). In a combined model, NFL accounted for 3.2% of unique variance in WMHs and A\u03b242 accounted for an additional 4.3% beyond NFL, providing novel evidence of the co-occurrence of at least 2 distinct pathways for WMHs among older adults, including amyloid deposition and axonal injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Dementia", "Neurofilament light", "White matter hyperintensities", "\u03b2-amyloid42"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046034660", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56785622300": {"Name": "Osborn K.E.", "AuthorID": "56785622300", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55730508500": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "55730508500", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57201549542": {"Name": "Moore E.E.", "AuthorID": "57201549542", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57200675905": {"Name": "Cambronero F.E.", "AuthorID": "57200675905", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55641546300": {"Name": "Acosta L.M.Y.", "AuthorID": "55641546300", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55963292300": {"Name": "Bell S.P.", "AuthorID": "55963292300", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Divisions of Cardiovascular and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57201747708": {"Name": "Babicz M.A.", "AuthorID": "57201747708", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55423432400": {"Name": "Gordon E.A.", "AuthorID": "55423432400", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57202306584": {"Name": "Pechman K.R.", "AuthorID": "57202306584", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55956988700": {"Name": "Gifford K.A.", "AuthorID": "55956988700", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57211697123": {"Name": "Hohman T.J.", "AuthorID": "57211697123", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "8228195700": {"Name": "Jefferson A.L.", "AuthorID": "8228195700", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "56478502300": {"Name": "Samuels L.R.", "AuthorID": "56478502300", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55121543500": {"Name": "Davis L.T.", "AuthorID": "55121543500", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Radiology & Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}}}
