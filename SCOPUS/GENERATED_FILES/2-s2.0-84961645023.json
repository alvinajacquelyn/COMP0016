In this Personal View, we present a neurodevelopmental theory to address causes for adolescent onsets of clinical depressive disorders. We argue that theories should account for three perplexing aspects of depressive disorders in adolescence: the episodic nature of depression; differences between sexes in rates of depression across development; and age-differentiated onsets. We consider how theories such as psychosocial acceleration, heterochronic brain development, dual-process models, glucocorticoid vulnerability hypothesis linked to early life stress, and epigenetic and genetic susceptibility might explain some aspects of adolescent depressive disorders. We argue that some synthesis between existing theories might be needed to establish a sufficient neurodevelopmental theoretical framework to explain onsets of depressive disorders in adolescence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Development", "Age of Onset", "Depressive Disorder", "Humans", "Nervous System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961645023", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"9436016800": {"Name": "Hagan C.C.", "AuthorID": "9436016800", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University"}, "55795553400": {"Name": "Graham J.M.E.", "AuthorID": "55795553400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "15078049200": {"Name": "Wilkinson P.O.", "AuthorID": "15078049200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004124496": {"Name": "Suckling J.", "AuthorID": "7004124496", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Neurosciences in Psychiatry Network, University of Cambridge"}, "7007103224": {"Name": "Sahakian B.J.", "AuthorID": "7007103224", "AffiliationID": "60032894, 60015879, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Neurosciences in Psychiatry Network, University of Cambridge"}, "57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud Centre and Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
