All rights reserved.Reactions of the triosmium clusters Os3(CO)10(\u03bc-dppm) [dppm = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane] and Os3(CO)8(\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4)(\u03bc-H) with Ph3GeH are described. With Os3(CO)10(\u03bc-dppm) at 110 \u00b0C the oxidative-addition product Os3(CO)9(GePh3)(\u03bc-dppm)(\u03bc-H) (1) initially results, but further decarbonylates upon prolonged heating to give 46-electron Os3(CO)7(GePh3)(\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4)(\u03bc-H)2 (2) resulting from C-H bond activation of the diphosphine. The pre-activated Os3(CO)8(\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4)(\u03bc-H) reacts with Ph3GeH under milder conditions (40 \u00b0C) to afford Os3(CO)8(GePh3)2(\u03bc-dppm)(\u03bc-H)2 (3) together with 1. Cluster 3 converts into 2 upon heating and the direct reaction between Os3(CO)8(\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4)(\u03bc-H) and Ph3GeH at 110 \u00b0C also produces 2. All these clusters have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm)", "Carbonyls", "Oxidative-addition of Ge-H bond", "Triosmium clusters", "Triphenylgermanium hydride (Ph3GeH)", "X-ray structures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm)", "Carbonyls", "H-bonds", "Triosmium clusters", "X-ray structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933566846", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56186166500": {"Name": "Haque M.R.", "AuthorID": "56186166500", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "57212814540": {"Name": "Hossain M.J.", "AuthorID": "57212814540", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "53871897200": {"Name": "Rahaman A.", "AuthorID": "53871897200", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.E.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7004115416": {"Name": "Hogarth G.", "AuthorID": "7004115416", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
