KGaA, Weinheim.Dynamic reductive kinetic resolutions of racemic 3-arylalkanones have been performed by the proper combination of an alcohol dehydrogenase and a basic anionic resin. The best results were found for the bioreduction with the alcohol dehydrogenase type A from Rhodococcus ruber DSM 44541 overexpressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli/ADH-A) and the commercially available evo-1.1.200, while the Amberlite IRA-440 C and the DOWEX-MWA-1 resins allowed efficient in situ racemizations. Reaction conditions were optimized in terms of enzyme source and loading, type and amount of resin, pH, temperature and reaction times, obtaining a series of (R,R)-substituted propan-2-ols with good conversions and both diastereoselectivity and stereoselectivity. As a proof of concept, the subsequent intramolecular cyclization of a selected propan-2-ol substrate afforded a valuable isochroman heterocycle without any loss of the optical purity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcohol dehydrogenases", "dynamic processes", "dynamic reductive kinetic resolutions", "ion exchange resins", "ketones"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954374699", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55987305300": {"Name": "M\u00e9ndez-S\u00e1nchez D.", "AuthorID": "55987305300", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Organic and Inorganic Chemistry Department, Biotechnology Institute of Asturias (IUBA), University of Oviedo"}, "55115517600": {"Name": "Mangas-S\u00e1nchez J.", "AuthorID": "55115517600", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, University of Lund"}, "13102857100": {"Name": "Busto E.", "AuthorID": "13102857100", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Organic Chemistry Department i, Faculty of Chemistry, Complutense University of Madrid"}, "7005873573": {"Name": "Gotor V.", "AuthorID": "7005873573", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Organic and Inorganic Chemistry Department, Biotechnology Institute of Asturias (IUBA), University of Oviedo"}, "6506762366": {"Name": "Gotor-Fern\u00e1ndez V.", "AuthorID": "6506762366", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Organic and Inorganic Chemistry Department, Biotechnology Institute of Asturias (IUBA), University of Oviedo"}}}
