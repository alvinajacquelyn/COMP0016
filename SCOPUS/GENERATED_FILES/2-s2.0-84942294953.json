The booklet, 'Bowel Cancer Screening: The Facts' accompanies this invitation. Its primary aim is to inform potential participants about the aims, advantages and disadvantages of colorectal cancer screening. Objective: To provide detailed commentary on how individuals process the information contained within 'The Facts' booklet. Design, setting and participants: This study comprised of 18 interviews with individuals aged 45-60 and used a 'think-aloud' paradigm in which participants read aloud the booklet. Participant utterances (verbal statements made in response to researcher-led prompts) were transcribed and analysed using a combination of content and thematic analysis. Results: A total of 776 coded utterances were analysed (mean = 43.1 per person; range = 8-95). While overall comprehension was satisfactory, several problem areas were identified such as the use of complex unfamiliar terminology and the presentation of numerical information. Specific sections such as colonoscopy risk information evoked negative emotional responses. Participants made several suggestions for ways in which comprehension might be improved. Conclusion: Public perceptions of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme information materials indicated that specific aspects of the booklet were difficult to process. These materials may be an appropriate target to improve public understanding of the aims, benefits and disadvantages of colorectal cancer screening. These findings will contribute to a broader NIHR-funded project that aims to design a supplementary 'gist-based' information leaflet suitable for low literacy populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer screening", "Colorectal cancer", "Fuzzy-trace theory", "Literacy", "Patient information", "Think aloud"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Comprehension", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pamphlets", "Patient Education as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942294953", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55501030300": {"Name": "Smith S.G.", "AuthorID": "55501030300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "36469257700": {"Name": "Vart G.", "AuthorID": "36469257700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "35239316000": {"Name": "Wolf M.S.", "AuthorID": "35239316000", "AffiliationID": "60013227", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Internal Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University"}, "26635766600": {"Name": "Obichere A.", "AuthorID": "26635766600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Colorectal Unit, Department of Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "55928640200": {"Name": "Baker H.J.", "AuthorID": "55928640200", "AffiliationID": "113768648", "AffiliationName": "Community Health and Learning Foundation"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, UCL"}}}
