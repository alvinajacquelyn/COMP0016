Robotic cystectomy is gaining popularity although the uptake of neobladder reconstruction is low, with the majority of cases being constructed extracorporeally via a mini-laparotomy. Minimally invasive cystectomy using the robotic platform facilitates intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction and several techniques have been described. This review discusses issues relating to patient selection, and describes existing techniques of open surgical neobladder reconstruction and their evolution to suit an intracorporeal approach.
