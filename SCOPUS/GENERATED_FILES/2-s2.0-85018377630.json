However, the effectiveness of ALA-PDT is limited by the relatively poor bioavailability of ALA and rapid conversion of PpIX to haem. The main goal of this study was to prepare and investigate a library of single conjugates designed to coadminister the bioactive agents ALA and hydroxypyridinone (HPO) iron chelators. A significant increase in intracellular PpIX levels was observed in all cell lines tested when compared to the administration of ALA alone. The higher PpIX levels observed using the conjugates correlated well with the observed phototoxicity following exposure of cells to light. Passive diffusion appears to be the main mechanism for the majority of ALA-HPOs investigated. This study demonstrates that ALA-HPOs significantly enhance phototherapeutic metabolite formation and phototoxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aminolevulinic Acid", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Photochemotherapy", "Pyridines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018377630", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"6506956251": {"Name": "Battah S.", "AuthorID": "6506956251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "6602717473": {"Name": "Dobbin P.", "AuthorID": "6602717473", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex"}, "7102451936": {"Name": "Hider R.", "AuthorID": "7102451936", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "56564615500": {"Name": "Zhou T.", "AuthorID": "56564615500", "AffiliationID": "60012581", "AffiliationName": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Gongshang University"}}}
