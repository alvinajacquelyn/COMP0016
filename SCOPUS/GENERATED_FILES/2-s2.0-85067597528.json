Areas covered: A systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and abstracts of international congresses is performed to investigate immune recovery posttransplant. In this review, we discuss the pattern of immune recovery in the post-transplant period focusing on the impact of stem cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and cord blood) on immune recovery and HSCT outcome. We examine the impact of serotherapy on immune reconstitution and the need to tailor dosing of serotherapy agents when using different stem cell sources. We discuss new techniques being used particularly with cord blood and haploidentical grafts to improve immune recovery in each scenario. Expert opinion: Cord blood T cells provide a unique CD4+ biased immune reconstitution. Initial studies using targeted serotherapy with cord grafts showed improved immune recovery with limited alloreactivity. Two competing haploidentical approaches have developed in recent years including TCR\u03b1\u03b2/CD19 depleted grafts and post-cyclophosphamide haplo-HSCT. Both approaches have comparable survival rates with limited alloreactivity. However, delayed immune reconstitution is still an ongoing problem and could be improved by modified donor lymphocyte infusions from the same haploidentical donor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cord blood", "haploidentical", "Immune recovery", "rATG", "serotherapy", "stem cell source", "TCR\u03b1\u03b2/CD19 depleted grafts"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allografts", "Animals", "Antigens, CD19", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta", "Recovery of Function"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067597528", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55645792800": {"Name": "Elfeky R.", "AuthorID": "55645792800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and bone marrow transplant unit, Great Ormond Street hospital"}, "57209394498": {"Name": "Lazareva A.", "AuthorID": "57209394498", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and bone marrow transplant unit, Great Ormond Street hospital"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and bone marrow transplant unit, Great Ormond Street hospital"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and bone marrow transplant unit, Great Ormond Street hospital"}}}
