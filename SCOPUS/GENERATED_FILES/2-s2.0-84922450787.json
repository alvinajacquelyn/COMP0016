Morphological analysis shows that extant Tergestiella and the Mesozoic genus Cyclagelosphaera (Watznaueriaceae), thought to have been extinct since the early Eocene (~. 54. Ma), are virtually identical. Molecular phylogenetic study supports the inference that T. adriatica is a direct descendent of Cyclagelosphaera. It is therefore a remarkable example of a living fossil. Our documentation of patchy coastal distribution in living T. adriatica and records of rare occurrences of fossil Cyclagelosphaera in Oligocene-Miocene shallow water sediments. , from the New Jersey shelf, suggest that Tergestiella/. Cyclagelosphaera was restricted to nearshore environments during much of the Cenozoic. This restricted ecology explains the lack of fossil Tergestiella/. Cyclagelosphaera recorded in open ocean sediments deposited during the last 54. myr.Floristic study of coccolithophores in the coastal and offshore waters of Tomari over a six-year period, show that T. adriatica occurs synchronously with the unusual neritic species, Braarudosphaera bigelowii, in mid-June. The environmental factors that induce the co-occurrence of these two taxa are uncertain, and T. adriatica did not co-occur with B. bigelowii at any other sites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcareous nannofossil", "Coccolithophore", "Cyclagelosphaera", "K/Pg mass extinction survivor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922450787", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"8225514100": {"Name": "Hagino K.", "AuthorID": "8225514100", "AffiliationID": "60013623", "AffiliationName": "Research and Education Faculty, Natural Sciences Cluster, Sciences Unit, Kochi University"}, "7408525261": {"Name": "Young J.", "AuthorID": "7408525261", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6701346236": {"Name": "Bown P.", "AuthorID": "6701346236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "35097338600": {"Name": "Godrijan J.", "AuthorID": "35097338600", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Marine Research, Ruder Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}, "55853553400": {"Name": "Kulhanek D.", "AuthorID": "55853553400", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "International Ocean Discovery Program, Texas A and M University"}, "7003499878": {"Name": "Kogame K.", "AuthorID": "7003499878", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural History Sciences, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University"}, "7202377525": {"Name": "Horiguchi T.", "AuthorID": "7202377525", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural History Sciences, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University"}}}
