Design Cross-sectional. Setting Chinandega and Le\u00f3n municipalities, a MeN hotspot on the Nicaraguan Pacific coast, January-February 2013. Participants 194 male workers aged 17-39years: 86 sugarcane cutters, 56 construction workers, 52 small-scale farmers. Outcome measures (1) Differences between the three occupational groups in prevalences/levels of socioeconomic, occupational, lifestyle and health risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in biomarkers of kidney function and hydration; (2) differences in prevalences/levels of CKD risk factors between workers with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR CKD-EPI <80mL/min/1.73m2) and workers with normal kidney function (eGFR CKD-EPI \u226580mL/min/1.73m2). Results Sugarcane cutters were more exposed to heat and consumed more fluid on workdays and had less obesity, lower blood sugar, lower blood pressure and a better lipid profile. Reduced eGFR occurred in 16%, 9% and 2% of sugarcane cutters, construction workers and farmers, respectively (trend cane > construction > farming, p=0.003). Significant trends (cane > construction > farming) were also observed for high serum urea nitrogen (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >20mg/dL), high serum creatinine (SCr >1.2mg/dL), low urinary pH (\u22645.5) and high BUN/SCr ratio (>20) but not for high urinary specific gravity (\u22651.030). Sugarcane cutters also more often had proteinuria and blood and leucocytes in the urine. Workers with eGFR <80mL/min/1.73m2 reported a higher intake of water and lower intake of sugary beverages. Serum uric acid levels related strongly and inversely to eGFR levels (adj \u03b2 \u00e2 '10.4mL/min/1.73m2, 95% CI \u00e2 '12.2 to \u00e2 '8.5, p<0.001). No associations were observed for other metabolic risk factors, pesticides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol. Among cane cutters, consumption of electrolyte hydration solution appeared preventive (adj \u03b2 8.1mL/min/1.73m2, p=0.09). Conclusions Heat stress, dehydration and kidney dysfunction were most common among sugarcane cutters. Kidney dysfunction also occurred to a lesser extent among construction workers, but hardly at all among small-scale farmers. High serum uric acid was associated with reduced kidney function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "Nephrology", "Occupational & Industrial Medicine", "Public Health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Agriculture", "Blood Urea Nitrogen", "Construction Industry", "Creatinine", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dehydration", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Heat Stress Disorders", "Hot Temperature", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Function Tests", "Male", "Nicaragua", "Occupational Diseases", "Occupational Exposure", "Occupations", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors", "Uric Acid", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003955399", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7004008573": {"Name": "Wesseling C.", "AuthorID": "7004008573", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Occupational Medicine, Institute of Environmental Medicine (IMM), Karolinska Institutet"}, "57206174933": {"Name": "Arag\u00f3n A.", "AuthorID": "57206174933", "AffiliationID": "100343025", "AffiliationName": "Research Research Centre on Health, Work and Environment (CISTA), National Autonomous University of Nicaragua"}, "35798238500": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez M.", "AuthorID": "35798238500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56368965600": {"Name": "Glaser J.", "AuthorID": "56368965600", "AffiliationID": "116266846", "AffiliationName": "La Isla Foundation"}, "56151203300": {"Name": "Weiss I.", "AuthorID": "56151203300", "AffiliationID": "116266846", "AffiliationName": "La Isla Foundation"}, "36027114800": {"Name": "Rivard C.J.", "AuthorID": "36027114800", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado"}, "36632895200": {"Name": "Roncal-Jim\u00e9nez C.", "AuthorID": "36632895200", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado"}, "57209163133": {"Name": "Johnson R.J.", "AuthorID": "57209163133", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado"}, "20533642000": {"Name": "Correa-Rotter R.", "AuthorID": "20533642000", "AffiliationID": "112568771", "AffiliationName": "Department Nephrology and Mineral Metabolism, National Medical Science and Nutrition Institute Salvador Zubir\u00e1n"}}}
