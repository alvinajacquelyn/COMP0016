Methods: In this cross-sectional multicenter study (a subset of the prospective Swedish BioFINDER study), we included 4 groups, representing the different stages of predementia AD: (1) cognitively healthy elderly with normal CSF \u03b2-amyloid 42 (A\u03b242), (2) cognitively healthy elderly with abnormal CSF A\u03b242, (3) patients with subjective cognitive decline and abnormal CSF A\u03b242, (4) patients with mild cognitive decline and abnormal CSF A\u03b242 (N total 352). Spectroscopic markers measured in the posterior cingulate/precuneus were considered alongside known disease biomarkers: CSF A\u03b242, phosphorylated tau, total tau, [18 F]-flutemetamol PET, f-MRI, and the genetic risk factor APOE. Results: Amyloid-positive cognitively healthy participants showed a significant increase in mI/creatine and mI/NAA levels compared to amyloid-negative healthy elderly (p < 0.05). In amyloid-positive healthy elderly, mI/creatine and mI/NAA correlated with cortical retention of [18 F] flutemetamol tracer (0.44, p 0.02 and 0.51, p 0.01, respectively). Healthy elderly APOE \u03f54 carriers with normal CSF A\u03b242 levels had significantly higher mI/creatine levels (p < 0.001) than \u03f54 noncarriers. Finally, elevated mI/creatine was associated with decreased functional connectivity within the default mode network (r pearson-0.16, p 0.02), independently of amyloid pathology. Conclusions: mI levels are elevated already at asymptomatic stages of AD. Moreover, mI/creatine concentrations were increased in healthy APOE \u03f54 carriers with normal CSF A\u03b242 levels, suggesting that mI levels may reveal regional brain consequences of APOE \u03f54 before detectable amyloid pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloidogenic Proteins", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Aspartic Acid", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Choline", "Cognition Disorders", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Inositol", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Prospective Studies", "Sweden", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978396743", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56235788100": {"Name": "Voevodskaya O.", "AuthorID": "56235788100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute"}, "7006588606": {"Name": "Wahlund L.", "AuthorID": "7006588606", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute"}, "35070775000": {"Name": "Westman E.", "AuthorID": "35070775000", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute"}, "7003500808": {"Name": "Sundgren P.", "AuthorID": "7003500808", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Lund University"}, "57190216813": {"Name": "Strandberg O.", "AuthorID": "57190216813", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Lund University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7003614157": {"Name": "Minthon L.", "AuthorID": "7003614157", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}}}
