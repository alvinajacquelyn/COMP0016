However, the extent to which this impulsivity is mediated by shared or distinct underlying neural mechanisms is unclear. Twenty-six boys with ADHD, 20 boys with OCD and 20 matched controls (aged 12\u201318) completed an fMRI version of an individually adjusted temporal discounting (TD) task which requires choosing between a variable amount of money now or \u00a3100 in one week, one month or one year. Activations to immediate and delayed reward choices were compared between groups using a three-way ANCOVA. ADHD patients had steeper discounting rates on the task relative to controls. OCD patients did not differ from controls or patients with ADHD. Patients with ADHD and OCD showed predominantly shared activation deficits during TD in fronto-striato-insular-cerebellar regions responsible for self-control and temporal foresight, suggesting that choice impulsivity is mediated by overlapping neural dysfunctions in both disorders. OCD patients alone showed dysfunction relative to controls in right orbitofrontal and rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, extending previous findings of abnormalities in these regions in OCD to the domain of choice impulsiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "Discounting", "fMRI", "Impulsivity", "OCD", "Reward"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Choice Behavior", "Delay Discounting", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reaction Time", "Reward", "Self-Control"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030481206", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57023384900": {"Name": "Norman L.J.", "AuthorID": "57023384900", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan"}, "55037261300": {"Name": "Carlisi C.O.", "AuthorID": "55037261300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "53363192200": {"Name": "Chantiluke K.", "AuthorID": "53363192200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7401764127": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "7401764127", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Institute for Translational Neurodevelopment and Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u05f3s College London"}, "6701327490": {"Name": "Rubia K.", "AuthorID": "6701327490", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "6506130967": {"Name": "Christakou A.", "AuthorID": "6506130967", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7101619950": {"Name": "Simmons A.", "AuthorID": "7101619950", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Center for Alzheimer Research, Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6602160284": {"Name": "Giampietro V.", "AuthorID": "6602160284", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7006746119": {"Name": "Brammer M.", "AuthorID": "7006746119", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004084003": {"Name": "Mataix-Cols D.", "AuthorID": "7004084003", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
