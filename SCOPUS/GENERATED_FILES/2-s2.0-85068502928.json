In this, the first study to investigate wellbeing in older Romanian people attending public and third sector day facilities, we tested our hypotheses, based on a successful aging model, that greater wellbeing would be associated with a healthier lifestyle (lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking), better physical health, mental health, social support (less loneliness) and absence of abuse. Methods: Older people (65+) without significant cognitive impairment, recruited from three Bucharest social care centers, completed structured questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Results: 100/140 (71%) eligible potential participants approached participated; mean WHO-5 score was 67.7 (standard deviation = 20.7); 25 (25%) scored <50, indicating low wellbeing. In our final model, lower depression (\u03b2 = \u22120.40, t = \u22123.8, p < 0.001) and loneliness scores (\u03b2 = \u22120.22, t = \u22122.1, p = 0.034) predicted higher wellbeing. More physical health problems and hospitalisations were associated with lower wellbeing on univariate analyses, but not in the final model. Screening positive for abuse (23 (23%) of participants), activities of daily living, alcohol and smoking status did not predict wellbeing. Conclusions: Despite experiencing high rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety and abuse, this population of older, Romanian people receiving social support, reported wellbeing levels comparable to European working populations. Loneliness was a more important predictor of lower wellbeing than any other factors studied. Tailored interventions to reduce loneliness in Romanian older people receiving community social support would be a rational next step.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elder abuse", "Health", "Life satisfaction", "Loneliness", "Older people", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068502928", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36054341500": {"Name": "Caciula I.", "AuthorID": "36054341500", "AffiliationID": "60001478", "AffiliationName": "University of Bucharest, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Studies, Department of Psychology, Soseaua Panduri 90"}, "55839567000": {"Name": "Boscaiu V.", "AuthorID": "55839567000", "AffiliationID": "60030238, 60002823", "AffiliationName": "\u201cGheorghe Mihoc-Caius Iacob\u201d Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Applied Mathematics of Romanian Academy, Calea 13 Septembrie No. 13, Sector 5"}, "10243664700": {"Name": "Cooper C.", "AuthorID": "10243664700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychiatry, 6th Floor, Wings A and B, Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Road"}}}
