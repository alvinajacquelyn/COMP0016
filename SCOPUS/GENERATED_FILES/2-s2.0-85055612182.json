Published by BMJ.Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of a novel multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and cognitive fusion transperineal targeted biopsy (MRTB) led prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostic service with regard to cancer detection and reducing time to diagnosis and treatment. Design Consecutive men being investigated for possible PCa under the UK 2-week wait guidelines. Setting Tertiary referral centre for PCa in the UK. Participants Men referred with a raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal examination between February 2015 and March 2016 under the UK 2-week rule guideline. Interventions An mpMRI was performed prior to patients attending clinic, on the same day. If required, MRTB was offered. Results were available within 48 hours and discussed at a specialist multidisciplinary team meeting. Patients returned for counselling within 7 days Primary and secondary outcome measures Outcome measures in this regard included the time to diagnosis and treatment of patients referred with a suspicion of PCa. Quality control outcome measures included clinically significant and total cancer detection rates. Results 112 men were referred to the service. 111 (99.1%) underwent mpMRI. Median PSA was 9.4 ng/mL (IQR 5.6-21.0). 87 patients had a target on mpMRI with 25 scoring Likert 3/5 for likelihood of disease, 26 4/5 and 36 5/5. 57 (51%) patients received a local anaesthetic, Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy (MRTB). Cancer was detected in 45 (79%). 43 (96%) had University College London definition 2 disease or greater. The times to diagnosis and treatment were a median of 8 and 20 days, respectively. Conclusions This approach greatly reduces the time to diagnosis and treatment. Detection rates of significant cancer are high. Similar services may be valuable to patients with a potential diagnosis of PCa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["local anaesthetic", "prostate cancer diagnostic pathway", "targeted prostate biopsy", "transperineal prostate biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prospective Studies", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tertiary Care Centers", "Time-to-Treatment", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055612182", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57192006863": {"Name": "Bass E.J.", "AuthorID": "57192006863", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23566729200": {"Name": "Jameson C.", "AuthorID": "23566729200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220423487": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "57220423487", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
