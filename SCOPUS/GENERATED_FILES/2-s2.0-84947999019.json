However, power generation from coal results in large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Solvent-based carbon capture is a relatively mature technology which can potentially mitigate these emissions. Although, much research has been done on this topic, single-point performance analysis of capture plant and ignoring operational characteristics of the upstream power plant may result in unrealistic performance assessments. This paper introduces a new methodology to assess the performance of CO2 capture solvents. The problem is posed as retrofitting an existing pulverized coal power plant with post-combustion carbon capture using two solvents: CDRMax, a recently developed amine-promoted buffer salt (APBS) solvent by Carbon Clean Solutions Limited (CCSL) and the monoethanolamine (MEA) baseline solvent. The features of interest include model development and validation using pilot plant data, as well as integrated design and control of the capture process. The emphasis is on design and operation of the capture plant, when integrated with the upstream coal-fired power plant, subject to variations in the electricity load. The results suggest that optimal design and operation of capture plant can significantly mitigate the energetic penalties associated with carbon capture form the flue gas, while providing effective measures for comparing solvent performances under various scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Integrated process design and control", "Optimization under uncertainty", "Process retrofit", "Pulverized coal power plant (PCPP)", "Solvent-based CO2 capture"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 capture", "Coal-fired power plant", "Integrated process designs", "Operational characteristics", "Optimization under uncertainty", "Performance assessment", "Post-combustion carbon captures", "Pulverized coal power plant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947999019", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"8369664900": {"Name": "Sharifzadeh M.", "AuthorID": "8369664900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering (CPSE), Imperial College London"}, "56846290400": {"Name": "Shah N.", "AuthorID": "56846290400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering (CPSE), Imperial College London"}, "56518110000": {"Name": "Bumb P.", "AuthorID": "56518110000", "AffiliationID": "114994359", "AffiliationName": "Carbon Clean Solutions Limited"}}}
