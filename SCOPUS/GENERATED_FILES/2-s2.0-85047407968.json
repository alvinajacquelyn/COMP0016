Using membership categorisation analysis, the article looks at how members negotiated a category distinction between homeopathy and \u2018orthodox Western medicine\u2019, focusing on the discursive resources that the participants drew on to position each other and the website itself in moral terms. This analysis contributes to our understanding of the institutionalisation of complementary and alternative medicine by demonstrating the strong polarisation of views that are present in the public domain, and the ways that public institutions become held accountable to ideologies of evidence and choice. In this way, the study adds to our growing knowledge about public engagement in pluralistic healthcare systems, showing further the limitations of the \u2018rational choice\u2019 assumptions that underlie pluralism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evidence based medicine", "homeopathy", "membership categorisation analysis", "online communities", "pluralistic healthcare"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047407968", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55588397700": {"Name": "Gibson W.", "AuthorID": "55588397700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Education"}}}
