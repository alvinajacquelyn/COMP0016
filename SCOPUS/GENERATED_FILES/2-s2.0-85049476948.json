Fertilization is the consequence of the fusion of two haploid gametes, the oocyte and the sperm. In mammals, such as human and mouse, this occurs in the female genital tracks. However, imaging in utero is still very limited, which prompts the use of extra utero techniques. In particular, in vitro fertilization provides a quick and simple way to study the very early steps of mouse embryo development. Here, I describe a simple and hands-on protocol to perform in vitro fertilization using the mouse as a model system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["In vitro fertilization", "Mouse oocyte", "Superovulation", "Zygote"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Embryonic Development", "Female", "Fertilization in Vitro", "Mice", "Oocytes"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049476948", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55081566900": {"Name": "Chaigne A.", "AuthorID": "55081566900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
