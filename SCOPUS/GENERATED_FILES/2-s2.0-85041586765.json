The effect of sodium and potassium on the phase transition temperature as well as on the solar modulations were investigated. A dopant concentration of 0.3 at% resulted in a reduction of the critical transition temperature (Tc) from 62 \u00b0C to 57 \u00b0C and 47 \u00b0C for the sodium and potassium doped films, respectively. Moreover, both dopants improved the solar modulations (\u0394Tsol) of the undoped VO2 films from 3.81 to 9.44 and 5.43 %, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dopant", "sol-gel", "thin film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical transition temperatures", "Dopant concentrations", "Low temperature annealing", "Sol-gel spin coating", "Solar modulation", "Thermo-chromic", "Thermochromic properties", "Vanadium dioxide thin films"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041586765", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57191442390": {"Name": "Top I.", "AuthorID": "57191442390", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7801602505": {"Name": "Binions R.", "AuthorID": "7801602505", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57198865716": {"Name": "Srimurugananthan S.", "AuthorID": "57198865716", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55639855600": {"Name": "Schl\u00e4fer J.", "AuthorID": "55639855600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55839956500": {"Name": "Powell M.", "AuthorID": "55839956500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005656987": {"Name": "Abrahams I.", "AuthorID": "7005656987", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
