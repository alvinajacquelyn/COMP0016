In the case of \u03b17 nAChRs, both positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs) have been identified and have attracted considerable interest. A recent study, employing revised structural models of the transmembrane domain of the \u03b17 nAChR in closed and open conformations, has provided support for an inter-subunit transmembrane allosteric binding site (Newcombe et al 2017). In the present study, we have performed virtual screening of the DrugBank database using pharmacophore queries that were based on the predicted binding mode of PAMs to \u03b17 nAChR structural models. A total of 81 compounds were identified in the DrugBank database, of which the 25 highest-ranked hits corresponded to one of four previously-identified therapeutic compound groups (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, diuretics targeting the Na + -K + -Cl - cotransporter, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics targeting DNA gyrase). The top-ranked compound from each of these four groups (DB04763, DB08122, furosemide and pefloxacin, respectively) was tested for its effects on human \u03b17 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. These studies, conducted with wild-type, mutant and chimeric receptors, resulted in all four compounds exerting allosteric modulatory effects. While DB04763, DB08122 and pefloxacin were antagonists, furosemide potentiated ACh responses. Our findings, supported by docking studies, are consistent with these compounds acting as PAMs and NAMs of the \u03b17 nAChR via interaction with a transmembrane site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allosteric modulation", "Ion channel", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "Virtual screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Allosteric Site", "alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor", "Animals", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Furosemide", "Humans", "Membrane Potentials", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Structure", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Nicotinic Agonists", "Nicotinic Antagonists", "Oocytes", "Pefloxacin", "Protein Conformation", "Xenopus laevis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050115664", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57194446829": {"Name": "Smelt C.", "AuthorID": "57194446829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57195582047": {"Name": "Sanders V.", "AuthorID": "57195582047", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57202987621": {"Name": "Burt R.", "AuthorID": "57202987621", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7006347978": {"Name": "Millar N.", "AuthorID": "7006347978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57200832162": {"Name": "Newcombe J.", "AuthorID": "57200832162", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006421825": {"Name": "Topf M.", "AuthorID": "7006421825", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}}}
