Child Development \u00a9 2017 Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.Emotional overeating (EOE) is the tendency to eat more in response to negative emotions; its etiology in early life is unknown. We established the relative genetic and environmental influences on EOE in toddlerhood and early childhood. Data were from Gemini, a population-based cohort of 2,402 British twins born in 2007. EOE was measured using the \u201cemotional overeating\u201d scale of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) at 16 months and 5 years. A longitudinal quantitative genetic model established that genetic influences on EOE were minimal; on the other hand, shared environmental influences explained most of the variance. EOE was moderately stable from 16 months to 5 years and continuing environmental factors shared by twin pairs at both ages explained the longitudinal association.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Behavior", "Child, Preschool", "Emotions", "Environment", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Twins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049928584", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57190166382": {"Name": "Herle M.", "AuthorID": "57190166382", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "54414058400": {"Name": "Fildes A.", "AuthorID": "54414058400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "6701830835": {"Name": "Rijsdijk F.", "AuthorID": "6701830835", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "34873706500": {"Name": "Steinsbekk S.", "AuthorID": "34873706500", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
