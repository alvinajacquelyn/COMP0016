Furthermore, to use computer-assisted facial gestalt analysis in PIGT-CDG and to the compare findings with other glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor deficiencies. Methods: We evaluated 13 children from eight unrelated families with homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in PIGT. Results: All patients had hypotonia, severe developmental delay, and epilepsy. Epilepsy onset ranged from first day of life to two years of age. Severity of the seizure disorder varied from treatable seizures to severe neonatal onset epileptic encephalopathies. The facial gestalt of patients resembled that of previously published PIGT patients as they were closest to the center of the PIGT cluster in the clinical face phenotype space and were distinguishable from other gene-specific phenotypes. Conclusion: We expand our knowledge of PIGT. Our cases reaffirm that the use of genetic testing is essential for diagnosis in this group of disorders. Finally, we show that computer-assisted facial gestalt analysis accurately assigned PIGT cases to the multiple congenital anomalies\u2013hypotonia\u2013seizures syndrome phenotypic series advocating the additional use of next-generation phenotyping technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computer-assisted facial gestalt analysis", "congenital disorder of glycosylation", "epilepsy",
