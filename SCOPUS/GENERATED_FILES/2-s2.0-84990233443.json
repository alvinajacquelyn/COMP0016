Some growth in dual full-time earners, increased working hours of mothers in part-time employment and a growing proportion of households with \u2018non-standard\u2019 working patterns are all identified, suggesting both a convergence and greater diversity in economic provisioning within parent couple households. Household employment patterns remain strongly associated with maternal education and family size but are becoming less sensitive to the age of the youngest child. The dual full-time earner model is growing in significance for British parents of young children but a new gender egalitarian equilibrium has not yet been reached.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breadwinners", "dual earners", "education", "employment", "families", "gender"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990233443", "SubjectAreas": [["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"57188764179": {"Name": "Connolly S.", "AuthorID": "57188764179", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "57143978800": {"Name": "Aldrich M.", "AuthorID": "57143978800", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "57190298386": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57190298386", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "55815999700": {"Name": "Speight S.", "AuthorID": "55815999700", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Social Research"}, "57143969400": {"Name": "Poole E.", "AuthorID": "57143969400", "AffiliationID": "100755262", "AffiliationName": "Arts Council England"}}}
