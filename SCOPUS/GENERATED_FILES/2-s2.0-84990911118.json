Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation reflect environmental risk factors, and are increasingly recognised for their fundamental role in diseases such as cancer. DNA methylation is a gene-regulatory pattern, and hence provides a means by which to assess genomic regulatory interactions. Network models are a natural way to represent and analyse groups of such interactions. The utility of network models also increases as the quantity of data and number of variables increase, making them increasingly relevant to large-scale genomic studies. We propose methodology to infer prognostic genomic networks from a DNA methylation-based measure of genomic interaction and association. We then show how to identify prognostic biomarkers from such networks, which we term \u201cnetwork community oncomarkers\u201d. We illustrate the power of our proposed methodology in the context of a large publicly available breast cancer dataset.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community detection", "Computational biology", "Epigenomics", "Stochastic networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990911118", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"55560405000": {"Name": "Bartlett T.", "AuthorID": "55560405000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
