Interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors take center stage in the pathology of schizophrenia. We assessed if the stressor of reduced environmental enrichment applied in adulthood provokes deficits in the positive, negative or cognitive symptom domains of schizophrenia in a mouse line modeling NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction in forebrain inhibitory interneurons (Grin1 \u2206Ppp1r2 ). We find that Grin1 \u2206Ppp1r2 mice, when group-housed in highly enriched cages, appear largely normal across a wide range of schizophrenia-related behavioral tests. However, they display various short-term memory deficits when exposed to minimal enrichment. This demonstrates that the interaction between risk genes causing NMDA-receptor hypofunction and environmental risk factors may negatively impact cognition later in life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gene-environment interaction", "Interneurons", "NMDAR-receptor hypofunction", "Risk factors", "Schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061196755", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56037543800": {"Name": "Bygrave A.M.", "AuthorID": "56037543800", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford"}, "56829603400": {"Name": "Masiulis S.", "AuthorID": "56829603400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford"}, "26642885900": {"Name": "Bannerman D.M.", "AuthorID": "26642885900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford"}, "37034229300": {"Name": "K\u00e4tzel D.", "AuthorID": "37034229300", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physiology, University of Ulm"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
