We studied the association between medication beliefs and depressive symptoms, with non-adherence to phosphate binding medication in a group of HD patients at risk of complications due to hyperphosphatemia. Design Cross-sectional design. Methods Baseline data from 112 patients participating in a randomized controlled trial, evaluating an adherence intervention, are presented. All patients had serum phosphate levels >1.6 mmol/l at baseline. Adherence was measured by (1) serum phosphate and (2) Medication Adherence Report Scales (MARS). Beliefs about Medicines (BMQ) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were also evaluated. Results Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire necessity, but not concerns, beliefs were found to correlate with serum phosphate (r = -.23, p <.05) and self-reported adherence (r =.35, p <.01). In regression models, controlling for demographic, clinical and psychological variables, necessity beliefs explained the variance of serum phosphate (\u03b2 = -.22, p =.01) and self-reported adherence (\u03b2 =.30, p \u2264.01). Both BMQ concerns and depressive symptoms were not related to non-adherence. Conclusion Patients' beliefs about the necessity of their prescribed phosphate binding medications explain variation in non-adherence levels, measured both subjective and objectively. Dialysis patient's medication beliefs are potentially modifiable targets for future interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "haemodialysis", "hyperphosphatemia", "medication beliefs", "phosphate binders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Attitude to Health", "Chelating Agents", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Hyperphosphatemia", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Renal Dialysis", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937946964", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"54392308600": {"Name": "Wileman V.", "AuthorID": "54392308600", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lifespan and Chronic Illness Research, University of Hertfordshire, Health Research Building -2F420, School of Life and Medical Sciences"}, "24538065900": {"Name": "Wellsted D.", "AuthorID": "24538065900", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lifespan and Chronic Illness Research, University of Hertfordshire, Health Research Building -2F420, School of Life and Medical Sciences"}, "7006817812": {"Name": "Farrington K.", "AuthorID": "7006817812", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit Lister Hospital"}, "15055280400": {"Name": "Almond M.", "AuthorID": "15055280400", "AffiliationID": "60033321", "AffiliationName": "Southend University Hospital"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital University College London"}, "24280993000": {"Name": "Chilcot J.", "AuthorID": "24280993000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}}}
