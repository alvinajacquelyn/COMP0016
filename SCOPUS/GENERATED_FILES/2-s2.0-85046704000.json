As such, processes benefiting from the enhanced absorption of light in plasmonic materials could also take profit of dark plasmon modes to boost and control nanoscale energy collection, storage, and transfer. We experimentally probe this process by imaging with nanoscale precision the hot-electron driven desorption of thiolated molecules from the surface of gold Fano nanostructures, investigating the effect of wavelength and polarization of the incident light. Spatially resolved absorption maps allow us to show the contribution of each element of the nanoantenna in the hot-electron driven process and their interplay in exciting a dark plasmon mode. Plasmon-mode engineering allows control of nanoscale reactivity and offers a route to further enhance and manipulate hot-electron driven chemical reactions and energy-conversion and transfer at the nanoscale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dark modes", "Fano resonances", "hot-electrons", "nanoscale precision", "self-assembly", "super-resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electron-driven", "Energy collection", "Enhanced absorption", "Fano resonances", "Nanoscale precision", "Plasmon hybridization", "Radiative loss", "Spatially resolved"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046704000", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56165707700": {"Name": "Simoncelli S.", "AuthorID": "56165707700", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "56040374100": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56040374100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "26424957600": {"Name": "Cort\u00e9s E.", "AuthorID": "26424957600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "57212735116": {"Name": "Maier S.A.", "AuthorID": "57212735116", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department in Hybrid Nanosystems, Nanoinstitute Munich, Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
