The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is widely used to obtain such labels for sensor data. However, in an in-situ deployment, it is not feasible to expect users to precisely label the start and end time of each event or activity. For this reason, time-point based experience sampling (without an actual start and end time) is prevalent. We present a framework that applies multi-instance and semi-supervised learning techniques to perform to predict user annotations from multiple mobile sensor data streams. Our proposed framework estimates users' annotations in ESM-based studies progressively, via an interactive pipeline of co-training and active learning. We evaluate our work using data collected from an in-the-wild data collection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Annotation prediction", "Experience improvement", "Experience Sampling Method", "Human activities", "Mobile sensing", "Multi-instance learning", "Multi-view learning", "Semi-supervised learning", "User annotation", "User-driven data collection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data collection", "Experience improvement", "Experience sampling method", "Human activities", "Mobile sensing", "Multi-instance learning", "Multi-view learning", "Semi- supervised learning", "User annotations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070221478", "SubjectAreas": [["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"36809919900": {"Name": "Liono J.", "AuthorID": "36809919900", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science and Information Technology, RMIT University"}, "7801420000": {"Name": "Salim F.D.", "AuthorID": "7801420000", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science and Information Technology, RMIT University"}, "56032304300": {"Name": "Van Berkel N.", "AuthorID": "56032304300", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "6508135447": {"Name": "Kostakos V.", "AuthorID": "6508135447", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "7004084538": {"Name": "Qin A.K.", "AuthorID": "7004084538", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology"}}}
