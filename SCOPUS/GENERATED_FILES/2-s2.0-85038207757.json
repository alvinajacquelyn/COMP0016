This paper is devoted to theoretical modeling of a relative motion of a pair of microbeads (either soft ferromagnetic or diamagnetic) in the ferrofluid under the action of applied uniform magnetic field which induces magnetic moments in the microbeads making them attracting to each other. The model is based on a point-dipole approximation for the magnetic interactions between microbeads mediated by the ferrofluid; however, the ferrofluid is considered to possess an anisotropic magnetic permeability thanks to field-induced structuring of its nanoparticles. The model is tested against experimental results and shows generally better agreement with experiments than the model considering isotropic magnetic permeability of ferrofluids. The results could be useful for understanding kinetics of aggregation of microbeads suspended in a ferrofluid. From a broader perspective, the present study is believed to contribute to a general understanding of particle behaviors in anisotropic media.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["External magnetic field", "Magnetic interactions", "Magnetic nano-particles", "Micron-sized particles", "Permeability anisotropy", "Point-dipole approximation", "Theoretical modeling", "Uniform magnetic fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038207757", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7006396762": {"Name": "Lopez-Lopez M.T.", "AuthorID": "7006396762", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Granada, Campus de Fuentenueva"}, "56817007800": {"Name": "Nogueras-Lara F.", "AuthorID": "56817007800", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Granada, Campus de Fuentenueva"}, "36621316600": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Arco L.", "AuthorID": "36621316600", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Granada, Campus de Fuentenueva"}, "22233946800": {"Name": "Guigo N.", "AuthorID": "22233946800", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60110763", "AffiliationName": "University of C\u00f4te d'Azur, CNRS UMR 7272, Institute of Chemistry of Nice, Parc Valrose"}, "6701743866": {"Name": "Sbirrazzuoli N.", "AuthorID": "6701743866", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60110763", "AffiliationName": "University of C\u00f4te d'Azur, CNRS UMR 7272, Institute of Chemistry of Nice, Parc Valrose"}, "35563661900": {"Name": "Zubarev A.Y.", "AuthorID": "35563661900", "AffiliationID": "60103702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, Urals Federal University"}, "6602854555": {"Name": "Lacis S.", "AuthorID": "6602854555", "AffiliationID": "60071043", "AffiliationName": "MMML Lab, Department of Physics, University of Latvia"}, "55759511643": {"Name": "Kuzhir P.", "AuthorID": "55759511643", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60110740", "AffiliationName": "University of C\u00f4te d'Azur, CNRS UMR 7010, Institute of Physics of Nice (INNI)"}}}
