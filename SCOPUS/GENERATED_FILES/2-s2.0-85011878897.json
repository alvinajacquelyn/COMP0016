To date, a comprehensive study of iron oxide NPs is still lacking not only on the size dependence of structural phases but also in the use of an appropriate model. Herein, we report on a systematic study of the structural and magnetic properties of iron oxide NPs prepared by a co-precipitation method followed by hydrothermal treatment. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy reveal that the NPs have an inverse spinel structure of iron oxide phase (Fe3O4) with average crystallite sizes (DXRD) of 6\u201319 nm, while grain sizes (DTEM) are of 7\u201323 nm. In addition, the larger the particle size, the closer the experimental lattice constant value is to that of the magnetite structure. Magnetic field-dependent magnetization data and analysis show that the effective anisotropy constants of the Fe3O4 NPs are about five times larger than that of their bulk counterpart. Particle size (D) dependence of the magnetization and the non-saturating behavior observed in applied fields up to 50 kOe are discussed using the core\u2013shell structure model. We find that with decreasing D, while the calculated thickness of the shell of disordered spins (t \u223c 0.3 nm) remains almost unchanged, the specific surface areas Sa increases significantly, thus reducing the magnetization of the NPs. We also probe the coercivity of the NPs by using the mixed coercive Kneller and Luborsky model. The calculated results indicate that the coercivity rises monotonously with the particle size, and are well matched with the experimental ones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coercive force", "effective anisotropy", "hydrothermal", "Iron oxide", "magnetization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coprecipitation method", "Effective anisotropy", "Effective anisotropy constant", "hydrothermal", "Hydrothermal treatments", "Inverse spinel structures", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Structural and magnetic properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011878897", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"24338867000": {"Name": "Phong P.T.", "AuthorID": "24338867000", "AffiliationID": "60078563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Applied Sciences, Ton Duc Thang University"}, "57189376206": {"Name": "Oanh V.T.K.", "AuthorID": "57189376206", "AffiliationID": "60071354, 60071359", "AffiliationName": "Graduate University of Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology"}, "7003964772": {"Name": "Phuc N.X.", "AuthorID": "7003964772", "AffiliationID": "60071372, 60071359", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Science, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology"}, "13612172600": {"Name": "Manh D.H.", "AuthorID": "13612172600", "AffiliationID": "60071372, 60071359", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Science, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology"}, "25638722800": {"Name": "Lam T.D.", "AuthorID": "25638722800", "AffiliationID": "60071354, 60071359", "AffiliationName": "Graduate University of Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology"}, "7102532000": {"Name": "Tung L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102532000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetic and Nanomaterials Laboratories"}, "7005152034": {"Name": "Thanh N.T.K.", "AuthorID": "7005152034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetic and Nanomaterials Laboratories"}}}
