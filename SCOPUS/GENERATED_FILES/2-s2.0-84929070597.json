Established medical therapies reduce inflammation, but there are currently no specific therapies to prevent fibrosis or treat established fibrosis. Our understanding of the pathogenic processes underpinning fibrogenesis is limited compared with our knowledge of the events initiating and propagating inflammation. There are several biomarkers for intestinal inflammation, but there are none that reflect the development of fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of cellular activities including inflammation and fibrosis and may serve as biomarkers of disease processes. Differential serum and mucosal miRNA expression profiles have been identified between patients with inflammatory bowel disease with active and inactive inflammatory disease. In contrast, studies in patients with fibrotic phenotypes are comparatively few, although specific miRNAs have defined roles in the development of fibrosis in other organ systems. Here, we discuss the most recent research on miRNA and fibrogenesis with a particular emphasis on Crohn's disease. We also anticipate the potential of miRNAs in fulfilling current unmet translational needs in this patient group by focusing on the role of miRNAs as modulators of fibrogenesis and on their potential value as serum biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the management of fibrosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "Crohn's disease", "fibrosis", "microRNA", "therapy targets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Crohn Disease", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Intestines", "MicroRNAs", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929070597", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"36893591000": {"Name": "Lewis A.", "AuthorID": "36893591000", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "56117329900": {"Name": "Nijhuis A.", "AuthorID": "56117329900", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "56402425500": {"Name": "Mehta S.", "AuthorID": "56402425500", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "56402609600": {"Name": "Kumagai T.", "AuthorID": "56402609600", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7201432421": {"Name": "Lindsay J.", "AuthorID": "7201432421", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7102398916": {"Name": "Silver A.", "AuthorID": "7102398916", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7003948545": {"Name": "Feakins R.", "AuthorID": "7003948545", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal London Hospital"}}}
