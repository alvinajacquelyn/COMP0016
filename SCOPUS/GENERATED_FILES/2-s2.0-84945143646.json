Methods: 229 participants with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities were recruited from 12 centres/sites in England from community intellectual disability services, day centres, supported housing schemes, voluntary organisations and invitation letters. Information on physical disability and socio-demographic variables were obtained using a structured data collection form. Self-reported stigma was measured using a validated questionnaire. Results: Age was associated with self-reported stigma, with older adults reporting more stigmatising experiences. Participants with moderate intellectual disabilities were more likely to report being treated differently such as being made fun of and being treated like children. Physical disability such as sensory, mobility and speech problems were not associated with self-reported stigma. Gender modified the relationship between severity of ID and self-reported stigma as participants who were male and had moderate ID were more likely to report stigma compared to females with moderate ID. Categorical age also modified the relationship between severity of ID and self-reported stigma as older participants who had moderate ID were more likely to report stigma compared to younger people with moderate ID. Conclusions: Older adults and those with moderate ID are potentially at higher risk of being targets of public stigma or are more likely to report stigma. Interventions to help individuals cope with stigma could be targeted to this group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrimination", "Intellectual disabilities", "Stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "African Continental Ancestry Group", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disabled Persons", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Self Report", "Severity of Illness Index", "Social Stigma", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945143646", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57211194358": {"Name": "Ali A.", "AuthorID": "57211194358", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
