Characterizing these networks therefore involves studying their activation across many different cognitive tasks, which previously was only possible with meta-analyses. Here, we use neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization, an approach combining real-time analysis of functional neuroimaging data with machine-learning, to discover cognitive tasks that segregate ventral and dorsal FPN activity. We identify and subsequently refine two cognitive tasks, Deductive Reasoning and Tower of London, which maximally dissociate the dorsal from ventral FPN. We subsequently investigate these two FPNs in the context of a wider range of FPNs and demonstrate the importance of studying the whole activity profile across tasks to uniquely differentiate any FPN. Our findings deviate from previous meta-analyses and hypothesized functional labels for these FPNs. Taken together the results form the starting point for a neurobiologically-derived cognitive taxonomy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Adult", "Bayes Theorem", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Nerve Net", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parietal Lobe", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044514731", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56559386700": {"Name": "Lorenz R.", "AuthorID": "56559386700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory (C3NL), Imperial College London"}, "16444234600": {"Name": "Hampshire A.", "AuthorID": "16444234600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory (C3NL), Imperial College London"}, "22956357800": {"Name": "Violante I.R.", "AuthorID": "22956357800", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172389", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "56346664600": {"Name": "Monti R.P.", "AuthorID": "56346664600", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "23019288000": {"Name": "Montana G.", "AuthorID": "23019288000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "22941607300": {"Name": "Leech R.", "AuthorID": "22941607300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Science, King's College London"}}}
