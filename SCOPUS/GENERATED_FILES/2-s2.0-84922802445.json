All rights reserved.Sound is a crucial component of the human communicative toolkit; however, as a topic of research, it has been relatively neglected in archaeological method and theory. We propose that a framework requires to be developed in which inferences can be made about the significance of sound in the past that are not bounded by the particularities of current cultural contexts. Such a framework should be multidisciplinary and draw on what is known scientifically about human sensitivities to and uses of sound, including nonverbal vocalizations, speech and music, ethological studies that offer insight into how sound perception and environment affect sociality and survival, and the effects of environment on socially significant human sound.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922802445", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57205970796": {"Name": "Blake E.C.", "AuthorID": "57205970796", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research of the University of Cambridge"}, "35247781700": {"Name": "Cross I.", "AuthorID": "35247781700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Centre for Music and Science"}}}
