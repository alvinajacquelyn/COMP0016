Autoimmunity is linked to changes in FOXP3 activity that can occur at multiple levels and lead to Treg dysfunction. For example, changes in IL-2 signaling, FOXP3 transcription and/or post-translational modifications can all contribute to loss of self-tolerance. As additional pathways of FOXP3 regulation are elucidated, new therapeutic approaches to increase Treg activity either by cell therapy or pharmacological intervention are being tested. Early success from pioneering studies of Treg-based therapy in transplantation has promoted the undertaking of similar studies in autoimmunity, with emerging evidence for the effectiveness of these approaches, particularly in the context of type 1 diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative Splicing", "Animals", "Autoimmunity", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Immunomodulation", "Immunotherapy", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein Transport", "Self Tolerance", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982291250", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55377236900": {"Name": "Pesenacker A.M.", "AuthorID": "55377236900", "AffiliationID": "60086967", "AffiliationName": "BC Children's Hospital Research Institute"}, "56193510800": {"Name": "Cook L.", "AuthorID": "56193510800", "AffiliationID": "60086967", "AffiliationName": "BC Children's Hospital Research Institute"}, "6602626959": {"Name": "Levings M.K.", "AuthorID": "6602626959", "AffiliationID": "60086967", "AffiliationName": "BC Children's Hospital Research Institute"}}}
