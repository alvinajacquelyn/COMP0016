Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology. All rights reserved.Background: The 5-year survival of ovarian cancer has slowly increased but to date much of this has been due to the use of more lines of treatment rather than better first-line therapy. In this setting, there has been little improvement over the past 15 years. The introduction of new treatments to extend time to first progression and overall survival remains a key objective of clinical research. Design: The focus of research in the previous decade has been on the incorporation of anti-angiogenic therapy or dose-dense scheduling of paclitaxel (Taxol) to improve outcome. The new trials being conducted build on the knowledge gained and are focussing on two new areas of research, the use of PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitors and immunotherapy. Results: Ongoing randomised trials using PARP inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibits are reviewed and the potential benefits and challenges of using these agents are discussed. Conclusions: Improvements in outcome from some of the many open trials may present challenges; interpretation of the outcome data needs to be taken in the context of clinical benefit and a health-economic assessment. The latter is becoming ever-more important as the cost of trials with combinations of targeted therapy is very great.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-angiogenesis", "First-line chemotherapy", "Immunotherapy", "Ovarian cancer", "PARP inhibitors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bevacizumab", "Carboplatin", "Cisplatin", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Paclitaxel", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039553675", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre, UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
