Published by the Royal Society.Neuropeptides are ancient regulators of physiology and behaviour, but reconstruction of neuropeptide evolution is often difficult owing to lack of sequence conservation. Here, we report that the receptor for the neuropeptide NGFFFamide in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (phylum Echinodermata) is an orthologue of vertebrate neuropeptide-S (NPS) receptors and crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) receptors. Importantly, this has facilitated reconstruction of the evolution of two bilaterian neuropeptide signalling systems. Genes encoding the precursor of a vasopressin/oxytocin-type neuropeptide and its receptor duplicated in a common ancestor of the Bilateria. One copy of the precursor retained ancestral features, as seen in highly conserved vasopressin/oxytocin-neurophysin-type precursors. The other copy diverged, but this took different courses in protostomes and deuterostomes. In protostomes, the occurrence of a disulfide bridge in neuropeptide product(s) of the precursor was retained, as in CCAP, but with loss of the neurophysin domain. In deuterostomes, we see the opposite scenario-the neuropeptides lost the disulfide bridge, and neurophysin was retained (as in the NGFFFamide precursor) but was subsequently lost in vertebrate NPS precursors. Thus, the sea urchin NGFFFamide precursor and receptor are 'missing links' in the evolutionary history of neuropeptides that control ecdysis in arthropods (CCAP) and regulate anxiety in humans (NPS).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evolution", "Neuropeptide", "Neuropeptide-S", "NGFFFamide", "Receptor", "Sea urchin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Cloning, Molecular", "Evolution, Molecular", "Humans", "Mass Spectrometry", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Neuropeptides", "Phylogeny", "Protein Precursors", "Receptors, Neuropeptide", "Strongylocentrotus purpuratus", "Vertebrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933060054", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55904326500": {"Name": "Semmens D.", "AuthorID": "55904326500", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7202269080": {"Name": "Rowe M.", "AuthorID": "7202269080", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56586167500": {"Name": "Blowes L.", "AuthorID": "56586167500", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006799505": {"Name": "Elphick M.", "AuthorID": "7006799505", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35745780600": {"Name": "Beets I.", "AuthorID": "35745780600", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Functional Genomics and Proteomics Group, KU Leuven"}, "6602473832": {"Name": "Oliveri P.", "AuthorID": "6602473832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London, Darwin Building"}}}
