However, icing and corrosion on concrete-based facilities such as roads, dams, and bridges often cause safety issues. Superhydrophobic surface with completely water-repellent properties that are inspired by the lotus leaf in nature, has great potential to solve this problem, however, most state-of-the-art and commercial superhydrophobic coatings are expensive and weak in mechanical robustness for large-scale application on concrete. Here, we developed an inexpensive, non-fluorinated, and robust superhydrophobic concrete (S-concrete) coating with a contact angle of 160 \u00b1 1\u00b0 and sliding angle of 6.5 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0. This coating had a high surface mechanical strength and retained superhydrophobicity after blade scratch for several times or sandpaper abrasion for 20 m distance. The robust S-concrete coating also had a good anti-icing ability, a low deicing force, and a high corrosion resistance, which is expected to be applied on roads, buildings, bridges, and many other concrete-based facilities in large scale for anti-icing and anti-corrosion purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concrete coating", "Mechanical strength", "Superhydrophobic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concrete coatings", "Large-scale applications", "Mechanical robustness", "Super-hydrophobic surfaces", "Superhydrophobic", "Superhydrophobic coatings", "Superhydrophobicity", "Water-repellent properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060307634", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"37077947000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "37077947000", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57203373313": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57203373313", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57212335086": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "57212335086", "AffiliationID": "60108755", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)"}, "56523935300": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "56523935300", "AffiliationID": "60005816, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Environment, South China Normal University"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
