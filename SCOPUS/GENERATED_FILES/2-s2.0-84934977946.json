Several previously introduced schemes for correcting finite-size errors are compared for accuracy and efficiency, and practical improvements are introduced. In particular, we test a simple but efficient method of finite-size correction based on an accurate combination of twist averaging and density functional theory. Our diffusion quantum Monte Carlo results for lithium and aluminum, as examples of metallic systems, demonstrate excellent agreement between all of the approaches considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion quantum monte carlo", "Finite size", "Finite size effect", "Finite-size corrections", "Metallic systems", "Quantum Monte Carlo calculations", "Systematic study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934977946", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"14627363100": {"Name": "Azadi S.", "AuthorID": "14627363100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "7101673327": {"Name": "Foulkes W.", "AuthorID": "7101673327", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}}}
