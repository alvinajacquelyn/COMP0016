The resistivity decreases with P and increases with T and our data are in very good agreement in relation to 1 atm data. Our melting temperature data agree with other experimental studies. We show that resistivity of Cu decreases along the P,T-dependent melting boundary in disagreement with prediction of resistivity invariance along the melting boundary. These findings are interpreted in terms of the competing effects of P and T on the electronic structure of liquid Cu. The electronic thermal conductivity is calculated from resistivity data using the Wiedemann-Franz law and is shown to increase with P in both the solid and liquid states but upon T increase, it decreases in the solid and increases in the liquid state.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Competing effects", "Electronic thermal conductivity", "First principle calculations", "High purity", "Liquid Phase", "Liquid state", "Resistivity data", "Wiedemann-Franz law"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021917159", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57194559130": {"Name": "Ezenwa I.C.", "AuthorID": "57194559130", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Western Ontario"}, "7006451630": {"Name": "Secco R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006451630", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Western Ontario"}, "13103864500": {"Name": "Yong W.", "AuthorID": "13103864500", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Western Ontario"}, "6701524157": {"Name": "Pozzo M.", "AuthorID": "6701524157", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences and Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
