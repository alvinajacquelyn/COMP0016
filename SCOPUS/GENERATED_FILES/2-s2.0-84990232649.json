We acknowledge the substantial contribution of Dr. Aykut Erkal in the design and installation of the monitoring system. The support of Colin Franklin, and cooperation of 1-Mill Bank and Abbey Mill residents during the installation of the monitoring system are greatly appreciated. We would like to thank Manaswini Acharya, Phil Attwool and Majid Naderi from Surface Measurement Systems Ltd. (SMS) for their help with dynamic vapour sorption testing, and the Centre for Environmental Data Archives (CEDA) for providing wind data. Duncan Gordon's help in writing the computer code is also kindly acknowledged.
