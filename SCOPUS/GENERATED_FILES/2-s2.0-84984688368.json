The results indicate that climatic conditions are of paramount importance in shaping the wild yak's distribution on the Tibetan Plateau. Habitat selection patterns were seasonal, with yaks appearing to select areas closer to villages during the vegetation-growing season. Unexpectedly, our index of forage quantity had a limited effect in determining the distribution of the species. Overall, our results suggest that expected changes in climate for this region could have a significant impact on habitat availability for wild yaks, and we call for more attention to be focused on the unique wildlife in this ecosystem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "generalized additive model", "highland", "large herbivore", "MaxEnt", "random forest", "seasonal habitats", "species distribution model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984688368", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"57215085709": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "57215085709", "AffiliationID": "110006106", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society"}, "55443235000": {"Name": "Kang A.", "AuthorID": "55443235000", "AffiliationID": "110006106", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London, Institute of Zoology"}}}
