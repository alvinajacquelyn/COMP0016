The response to SNS is variable, with a significant loss of efficacy in some patients. An increased frequency of stimulation may improve the efficacy of SNS for faecal incontinence. This study aimed to see if alteration of the pulse width or frequency improved the outcome for those with constipation. Method: Eleven patients with constipation currently being treated by SNS were recruited from three centres. They were randomized to five different protocols of stimulation each applied for 5 weeks. Group 1 used standard settings (pulse width 210 \u03bcs, frequency 14 Hz); in the other four groups (Groups 2-5) the pulse width and/or frequency were halved or doubled. Patients and investigators were blinded to the group allocation. Results: The Cleveland Clinic constipation score varied significantly between the five groups. Group 1 achieved the lowest score mean (\u00b1 SD) 13.4 (\u00b1 4.4) (P = 0.03). The number of digitations per defaecation was the lowest in Group 4, 90 \u03bcs and 14 Hz (P < 0.01). No other variable changed significantly. Standard settings were the most preferred by the recruited patients. Conclusion: Alteration of pulse width or frequency of stimulation had no significant effect on the outcome of SNS for constipation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constipation", "Neuromodulation", "SNS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Constipation", "Defecation", "Double-Blind Method", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Lumbosacral Plexus", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943272258", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"36438733800": {"Name": "Thomas G.P.", "AuthorID": "36438733800", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "The Sir Alan Parks Department of Physiology, St Mark's Hospital and Academic Institute"}, "23570493200": {"Name": "Dudding T.C.", "AuthorID": "23570493200", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "The Sir Alan Parks Department of Physiology, St Mark's Hospital and Academic Institute"}, "55355298000": {"Name": "Bradshaw E.", "AuthorID": "55355298000", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "The Sir Alan Parks Department of Physiology, St Mark's Hospital and Academic Institute"}, "57198274126": {"Name": "Nicholls R.J.", "AuthorID": "57198274126", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "The Sir Alan Parks Department of Physiology, St Mark's Hospital and Academic Institute"}, "57207954920": {"Name": "Vaizey C.J.", "AuthorID": "57207954920", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "The Sir Alan Parks Department of Physiology, St Mark's Hospital and Academic Institute"}, "36699567500": {"Name": "Duelund-Jakobsen J.", "AuthorID": "36699567500", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "7005800700": {"Name": "Laurberg S.", "AuthorID": "7005800700", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "56828870000": {"Name": "Alam A.", "AuthorID": "56828870000", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "GI Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "GI Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "15728488900": {"Name": "Thin N.", "AuthorID": "15728488900", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26643431700": {"Name": "Knowles C.H.", "AuthorID": "26643431700", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
