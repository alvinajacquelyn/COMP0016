The increasing range of different commercial and scientific TLS instruments holds challenges for data and instrument interoperability. Using data from various TLS sources will be critical to upscale study areas or compare data. In this paper, we provide a general framework to compare the interoperability of TLS instruments. We compare three TLS instruments that are the same make and model, the RIEGL VZ-400. We compare the range accuracy and evaluate the manufacturer's radiometric calibration for the uncalibrated return intensities. Our results show that the range accuracy between instruments is comparable and within the manufacturer's specifications. This means that the spatial XYZ data of different instruments can be combined into a single data set. Our findings demonstrate that radiometric calibration is instrument specific and needs to be carried out for each instrument individually before including reflectance information in TLS analysis. We show that the residuals between the calibrated reflectance panels and the apparent reflectance measured by the instrument are greatest for highest reflectance panels (residuals ranging from 0.058 to 0.312).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data interoperability", "radiometric calibration", "RIEGL VZ-400", "terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR)"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D measurement", "Air-borne sensors", "Calibration and validations", "Data interoperability", "Radiometric calibrations", "Terrestrial laser scanning", "Uncalibrated", "Vegetation structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013319443", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55574436900": {"Name": "Calders K.", "AuthorID": "55574436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "56041956600": {"Name": "Burt A.", "AuthorID": "56041956600", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Earth Observation, Climate and Optical Group, National Physical Laboratory"}, "57192694485": {"Name": "Origo N.", "AuthorID": "57192694485", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Earth Observation, Climate and Optical Group, National Physical Laboratory"}, "14033392700": {"Name": "Nightingale J.", "AuthorID": "14033392700", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Earth Observation, Climate and Optical Group, National Physical Laboratory"}, "7006197933": {"Name": "Disney M.I.", "AuthorID": "7006197933", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC National Centre for Earth Observation"}, "8318059800": {"Name": "Armston J.", "AuthorID": "8318059800", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland"}, "56668687700": {"Name": "Brede B.", "AuthorID": "56668687700", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing, Wageningen University"}, "57146663300": {"Name": "Muir J.", "AuthorID": "57146663300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Joint Remote Sensing Research Program, University of Queensland"}}}
