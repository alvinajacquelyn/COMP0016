A retrospective based cost analysis was performed to estimate Trust level savings of using the TYRX antibacterial envelope as a primary prevention measure against infection in a tertiary referral centre in South London, UK. Methods: A retrospective cohort of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction undergoing Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) procedures were evaluated. Decision-analytic modelling was performed to determine economic savings of using the envelope during CIED procedure vs CIED procedure alone. Results: Over a 12 month follow-up period following CIED procedure, the observed infection rate was 3.14% (n = 5/159). The average cost of a CIED infection inpatient admission was \u00a341,820 and, further to economic analysis, the additional costs attributable to infection was calculated at \u00a362,213.94. A cost saving of \u00a3624 per patient by using TYRX during CIED procedure as a primary preventative measure against infection was estimated. Conclusions: TYRX would be a cost-saving treatment option amongst heart failure patients undergoing ICD and CRT device procedures based on analysis in the local geographical area of South London. If upscaled to the UK population, we estimate potential cost savings for the National Health Service (NHS).", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac implantable electronic device", "economic model", "healthcare costs", "Infection", "TYRX envelope"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibiotic Prophylaxis", "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Decision Support Techniques", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Models, Economic", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "Retrospective Studies", "Tertiary Care Centers", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064323997", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"54416910100": {"Name": "Burnhope E.", "AuthorID": "54416910100", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas Hospital"}, "57208274733": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Guadarrama Y.", "AuthorID": "57208274733", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Rayne Institute, Kings College London"}, "57208271775": {"Name": "Waring M.", "AuthorID": "57208271775", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Rayne Institute, Kings College London"}, "35238416500": {"Name": "Pennington M.", "AuthorID": "35238416500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Rayne Institute, Kings College London"}, "6603307945": {"Name": "Carr-White G.", "AuthorID": "6603307945", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas Hospital"}, "57217533072": {"Name": "Rinaldi C.A.", "AuthorID": "57217533072", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas Hospital"}, "57208274656": {"Name": "Guilder A.", "AuthorID": "57208274656", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Health Informatics, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210464577": {"Name": "Malhotra B.", "AuthorID": "57210464577", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "TOHETI, Guys and St. Thomas Hospital"}, "57197702550": {"Name": "Razavi R.", "AuthorID": "57197702550", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Vice President, Kings College London"}}}
