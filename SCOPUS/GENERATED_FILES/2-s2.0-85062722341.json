Losses in university capacities through casualties, injuries and internal displacement or forced migration are difficult to compensate for due to the degree of investment required to restore or lay new foundations for quality teaching and research, while attacks on universities may also discourage learners from attending tertiary education. Drawing upon a research and capacity development project in Somaliland, we propose a global strategy for higher education partnerships in teaching, research and development with practical outcomes in the area of education, conflict and peacebuilding. This strategy would address research and pedagogical training needs for higher education teachers; develop educational partnerships between higher education institutions in conflict-affected regions to facilitate collaborative teaching exchange; and enhance collaboration between higher education institutions, civil society and I/NGOs to promote peacebuilding in conflict-affected societies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conflict", "Fragile contexts", "Higher education", "Partnerships", "Peacebuilding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062722341", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"36931205600": {"Name": "Pherali T.", "AuthorID": "36931205600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education and International Development, UCL Institute of Education"}, "56954118800": {"Name": "Lewis A.", "AuthorID": "56954118800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education and International Development, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
