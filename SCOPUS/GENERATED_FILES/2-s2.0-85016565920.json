This study assessed the ability of a classification-independent measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (Weiss & Marmar, 1996), to capture the ICD-11 model of PTSD. The current study also provided the first assessment of the predictive validity of ICD-11 PTSD. Former East German political prisoners were assessed in 1994 (N = 144) and in 2008-2009 (N = 88) on numerous psychological variables using self-report measures. Of the participants, 48.2% and 36.8% met probable diagnosis for ICD-11 PTSD at the first and second assessments, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the 3-factor ICD-11 model of PTSD, as represented by items selected from the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis demonstrated that, controlling for sex, the symptom clusters of ICD-11 PTSD (reexperiencing, avoidance, and sense of threat) significantly contributed to the explanation of depression (R2 =.17), quality of life (R2 =.21), internalized anger (R2 =.10), externalized anger (R2 =.12), hatred of perpetrators (R2 =.15), dysfunctional disclosure (R2 =.27), and social acknowledgment as a victim (R2 =.12) across the 15-year study period. Current findings add support for the factorial and predictive validity of ICD-11 PTSD within a unique cohort of political prisoners.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Depression", "Female", "Germany, East", "Humans", "International Classification of Diseases", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prisoners", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Regression Analysis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Report", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016565920", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55113504900": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "55113504900", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health, School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56059359000": {"Name": "Maercker A.", "AuthorID": "56059359000", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Division of Psychopathology, University of Zurich"}}}
