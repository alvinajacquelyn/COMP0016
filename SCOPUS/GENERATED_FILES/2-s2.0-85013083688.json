Measures accurately assessing these symptoms are important for clinical decisions. This study examined the reliability and validity of the Sensory Behavior Questionnaire, a parent-report scale designed to assess frequency and impact of sensory behaviors in autistic children. The scale demonstrated excellent internal consistency and concurrent validity, and was a better predictor of autistic symptoms than the Short Sensory Profile within a group of 66 school-age autistic children. The scale also successfully discriminated between autistic and typical children of similar age and ability. The Sensory Behavior Questionnaire has potential as a measure of sensory behaviors in children on the autism spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Sensory behaviors", "Sensory Questionnaire", "Sensory sensitivities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensation Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013083688", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"36093056400": {"Name": "Neil L.", "AuthorID": "36093056400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE), UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6507658484": {"Name": "Pellicano E.", "AuthorID": "6507658484", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}, "7404386357": {"Name": "Green D.", "AuthorID": "7404386357", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rehabilitation, Oxford Brookes University"}}}
