Moving beyond a focus on Banks's work with Captain Cook's first voyage of exploration to the Pacific, the papers expand on, while challenging, views of Banks as a 'centre of calculation' and all-powerful agent of science and imperialism in Georgian Britain. Banks is shown to have relied on a variety of expert men and women as actors and audiences for botany, operating with more diversified agendas and practices than previous pictures of him have suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charles Blagden", "Enlightenment", "Entomology", "Natural history", "Romanticism", "Sir Joseph Banks", "Women and science"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067496343", "SubjectAreas": [["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"15054925800": {"Name": "Werrett S.", "AuthorID": "15054925800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
