Attempting to bridge the gap between these approaches, we established a system for isolating the yeast genome as a library of mononucleosomes harboring the natural epigenetic signature, suitable for biochemical manipulation. Combined with deep sequencing, this library was used to investigate the stability of individual nucleosomes and, as proof of principle, the nucleosome preference of the chromatin remodeling complex, RSC. This approach uncovered a distinct preference of RSC for nucleosomes derived from regions with a high density of histone variant H2AZ, and this preference is indeed markedly diminished using nucleosomes from cells lacking H2AZ. The preference for H2AZ remodeling/nucleosome ejection can also be reconstituted with recombinant nucleosome arrays. Together, our data indicate that, despite being separated from their genomic context, individual nucleosomes can retain their original identity as promoter- or transcription start site (TSS)-nucleosomes. Besides shedding new light on substrate preference of the chromatin remodeler RSC, the simple experimental system outlined here should be generally applicable to the study of chromatin transactions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chromatin", "Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Genome, Fungal", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Histones", "Nucleosomes", "Protein Binding", "Transcription, Genetic", "Yeasts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067905394", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57195618948": {"Name": "Cakiroglu A.", "AuthorID": "57195618948", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "55831901800": {"Name": "Ehrensberger A.H.", "AuthorID": "55831901800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "24343757900": {"Name": "Darbo E.", "AuthorID": "24343757900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "6701608432": {"Name": "Luscombe N.M.", "AuthorID": "6701608432", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6507177690": {"Name": "Clapier C.R.", "AuthorID": "6507177690", "AffiliationID": "60136293, 60025488, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Utah, School of Medicine"}, "7004508741": {"Name": "Cairns B.R.", "AuthorID": "7004508741", "AffiliationID": "60136293, 60025488, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Utah, School of Medicine"}, "7006929834": {"Name": "Svejstrup J.Q.", "AuthorID": "7006929834", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
