The production of TCR gene-engineered T cells requires full T cell activation in vitro, and it is currently unknown whether in vivo interactions with conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) regulate the accumulation and function of engineered T cells in tumors. Using the B16 melanoma model and the inducible depletion of CD11c + cells in CD11c.diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) mice, we analyzed the interaction between tumor-resident cDCs and engineered T cells expressing the melanoma-specific TRP-2 TCR. We found that depletion of CD11c + cells triggered the recruitment of cross-presenting cDC1 into the tumor and enhanced the accumulation of TCR-engineered T cells. We show that the recruited tumor cDCs present melanoma tumor antigen, leading to enhanced activation of TCR-engineered T cells. In addition, detailed analysis of the tumor myeloid compartment revealed that the depletion of a population of DT-sensitive macrophages can contribute to the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Together, these data suggest that the relative frequency of tumor-resident cDCs and macrophages may impact the therapeutic efficacy of TCR gene therapy in solid tumors. The extent to which tumor-specific engineered T cells are regulated by endogenous immune cells is unclear. Here, Hotblack et al. exploit depletion of CD11c-expressing myeloid cells to demonstrate that dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment control the expansion of engineered T cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adoptive cellular therapy", "dendritic cells", "engineered T cells", "myeloid cells", "tumor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "CD11c Antigen", "Dendritic Cells", "Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Macrophages", "Melanoma, Experimental", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047826556", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"56416532300": {"Name": "Hotblack A.", "AuthorID": "56416532300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "16549320200": {"Name": "Holler A.", "AuthorID": "16549320200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57202303280": {"Name": "Piapi A.", "AuthorID": "57202303280", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56999726600": {"Name": "Ward S.", "AuthorID": "56999726600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}, "57202567329": {"Name": "Stauss H.", "AuthorID": "57202567329", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7401715179": {"Name": "Bennett C.", "AuthorID": "7401715179", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}}}
