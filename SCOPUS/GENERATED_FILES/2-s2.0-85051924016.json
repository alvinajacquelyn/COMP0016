The highly structured ordering, by means of functional groups and extensive cross-referencing, enables even the non-specialist to gain an immediate grasp of the subject matter. The potential and versatility of Vilsmeier chemistry makes this major reference work essential for every industrial and academic chemistry library. It should be consulted by every practicing organic chemist and owned by every specialist.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051924016", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"7007056698": {"Name": "Marson C.M.", "AuthorID": "7007056698", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Sheffield"}, "7005964682": {"Name": "Giles P.R.", "AuthorID": "7005964682", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Catholic University of Louvain"}}}
