Recent research reveals that such deviations from optimality are pervasive during perceptual development. We argue that a full understanding of perception requires a model of how perceptual systems become increasingly optimised during development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Decision Making", "Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061619908", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"8249732800": {"Name": "Nardini M.", "AuthorID": "8249732800", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Durham University"}, "36666127500": {"Name": "Dekker T.M.", "AuthorID": "36666127500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology and Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
