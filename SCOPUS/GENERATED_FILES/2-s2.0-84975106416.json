The lift takes values in the space of (1,1)-currents on the Shimura variety attached to GSpin(V); we show its values are cohomologous to currents given by integration on special divisors against automorphic Green functions. A later paper will show how to evaluate the new lift on differential forms obtained as usual (nonregularized) theta lifts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Shimura varieties", "Theta series", "Weil representation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975106416", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"]], "AuthorData": {"57189756977": {"Name": "Garcia L.", "AuthorID": "57189756977", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Toronto"}}}
