Patients underwent imaging with a widefield 50-degree spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) and Optos ultra-widefield imaging systems (Optos, United Kingdom).Results:Vitreous attachment at the site of the retinal hole was detected in 27/28 (96.4%) cases. Cases were split into three groups: RHs with RD (n = 12); RHs with subretinal fluid (n = 5), and flat RHs (n = 11), with minimal or no subretinal fluid. 91.6% retinal holes associated with subretinal fluid or RD had vitreous attachment at the site of the hole. Eighty percent had vitreous attachment at both edges of the retinal hole, in a U-shape configuration, which appeared to exert traction. By contrast, flat retinal holes had visible vitreous attachment only at one edge of the retinal hole in 45.4%.Conclusion:Vitreous attachment was commonly seen at the site of round retinal holes. Vitreous attachment at both edges of the retinal hole in a U-shape configuration was more commonly seen at holes associated with subretinal fluid or RD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["optical coherence tomography", "retinal detachment", "round hole"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retina", "Retinal Detachment", "Retinal Perforations", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vitrectomy", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066820435", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"54790729200": {"Name": "Casswell E.J.", "AuthorID": "54790729200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56857498800": {"Name": "Abou Ltaif S.", "AuthorID": "56857498800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57209204828": {"Name": "Carr T.", "AuthorID": "57209204828", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003299563": {"Name": "Charteris D.G.", "AuthorID": "7003299563", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "15520285500": {"Name": "Wickham L.", "AuthorID": "15520285500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
