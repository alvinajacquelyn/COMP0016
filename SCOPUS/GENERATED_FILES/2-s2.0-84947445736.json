Here, we compared four prototypes (PG9, CH01, PGT145, and CAP256.VRC26.09) of V2 apex bnAbs and showed that all recognized a core epitope of basic V2 residues and the glycan-N160. Two prototype bnAbs were derived from VH-germlines that were 99% identical and used a common germline D-gene encoded YYD-motif to interact with the V2-epitope. We identified isolates that were neutralized by inferred germline (iGL) versions of three of the prototype bnAbs. Soluble Env derived from one of these isolates was shown to form a well-ordered Env trimer that could serve as an immunogen to initiate a V2-apex bnAb response. These studies illustrate a strategy to transition from panels of bnAbs to vaccine candidates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Epitopes", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Vaccines", "Viral Envelope Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947445736", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23993427200": {"Name": "Andrabi R.", "AuthorID": "23993427200", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "56147448300": {"Name": "Voss J.", "AuthorID": "56147448300", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "35098914100": {"Name": "Liang C.", "AuthorID": "35098914100", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "36242903800": {"Name": "Briney B.", "AuthorID": "36242903800", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "36630795600": {"Name": "McCoy L.", "AuthorID": "36630795600", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "6601959415": {"Name": "Poignard P.", "AuthorID": "6601959415", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "7401577043": {"Name": "Burton D.", "AuthorID": "7401577043", "AffiliationID": "60009982, 60022195, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University"}, "35265629600": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "35265629600", "AffiliationID": "60092852, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica"}, "35493196700": {"Name": "Wong C.", "AuthorID": "35493196700", "AffiliationID": "60092852, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica"}}}
