A brief overview of the integral transform methodology is first provided for a general nonlinear convection\u2013diffusion problem. Then, different alternatives of eigenfunction expansion strategies are discussed in the integral transformation of problems for which the fluid flow model is either based on the primitive variables or the streamfunction-only formulations, as applied to both steady and transient states. Representative test cases are selected to illustrate the different eigenfunction expansion approaches, with convergence being analyzed for each situation. In addition, fully converged integral transform results are critically compared to previously reported simulations obtained from traditional purely discrete methods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Eigenfunction expansions", "Fluid flow problems", "Generalized integral transforms", "Heat and mass transfer", "Integral transformations", "Nonlinear convection", "Primitive variables", "Steady and transient state"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069976197", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"7005409712": {"Name": "Cotta R.", "AuthorID": "7005409712", "AffiliationID": "60101662", "AffiliationName": "Directorate General of Nuclear and Technological Development, DGDNTM, Brazilian Navy"}, "57200106585": {"Name": "Curi M.", "AuthorID": "57200106585", "AffiliationID": "60042765", "AffiliationName": "Centro Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica Celso Suckow da Fonseca, CEFET/RJ"}, "56473617600": {"Name": "Lisboa K.", "AuthorID": "56473617600", "AffiliationID": "60101662", "AffiliationName": "Directorate General of Nuclear and Technological Development, DGDNTM, Brazilian Navy"}, "6602671760": {"Name": "Balabani S.", "AuthorID": "6602671760", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701575186": {"Name": "Quaresma J.", "AuthorID": "6701575186", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Natural Resource Engineering in the Amazon, Institute of Technology, Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1"}, "7005663601": {"Name": "Mac\u00eado E.", "AuthorID": "7005663601", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Natural Resource Engineering in the Amazon, Institute of Technology, Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1"}, "57210219532": {"Name": "Amorim N.", "AuthorID": "57210219532", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Natural Resource Engineering in the Amazon, Institute of Technology, Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1"}, "6603683372": {"Name": "Perez-Guerrero J.", "AuthorID": "6603683372", "AffiliationID": "60008645", "AffiliationName": "Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de Energia Nuclear, CNEN"}}}
