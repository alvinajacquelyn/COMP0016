A potential energy surface (PES) obtained from ab initio electronic structure calculations is refined to experimental data, and the resulting energy levels display sub-wavenumber accuracy for all reliably known J = 0 term values under 6500 cm-1. After a small empirical adjustment of the band centres, our calculated (J = 1-6) rovibrational states reproduce 578 experimentally derived energies with a root-mean-square error of 0.122 cm-1. Absolute line intensities are computed using the refined PES and a new dipole moment surface (DMS) for transitions between states with energies up to 10 500 cm-1 and rotational quantum number J = 30. The computed DMS reproduces experimental line intensities to within 10% uncertainty for the \u03bd1 and \u03bd3 bands. Furthermore, our calculated absorption cross-sections display good agreement with the main absorption features recorded in the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the complete range of 600-6500 cm-1.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab-initio electronic structure calculations", "Absolute line intensities", "Absorption cross sections", "Dipole moment surfaces", "Pacific northwest national laboratories", "Root mean square errors", "Rotational quantum numbers", "Transition intensity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061145052", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57190288409": {"Name": "Coles P.A.", "AuthorID": "57190288409", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6602622365": {"Name": "Kovacich R.P.", "AuthorID": "6602622365", "AffiliationID": "60109009", "AffiliationName": "Servomex Ltd, Millbrook Industrial Estate"}, "13612728600": {"Name": "Hobby J.", "AuthorID": "13612728600", "AffiliationID": "60109009", "AffiliationName": "Servomex Ltd, Millbrook Industrial Estate"}}}
