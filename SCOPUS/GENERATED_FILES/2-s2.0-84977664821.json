Moreover, we show in rats that a genuine \u03b2-rhythm coexists alongside \u03b2-activity that reflects the second harmonic of the arch-shaped somatosensory \u03b1-rhythm. This demonstration of a genuine somatosensory \u03b2-rhythm depends on a novel quantification of neuronal oscillations that is based on their rhythmic nature: lagged coherence. Using lagged coherence, we provide two lines of evidence that this somatosensory \u03b2-rhythm is distinct from the second harmonic of the archshaped \u03b1-rhythm. The first is based on the rhythms\u2019 spatial properties: the \u03b1- and \u03b2-rhythms are demonstrated to have significantly different topographies. The second is based on the rhythms\u2019 temporal properties: the lagged phase-phase coupling between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-rhythms is demonstrated to be significantly less than would be expected if both reflected a single underlying nonsinusoidal rhythm. Finally, we demonstrate that 1) the lagged coherence spectrum is consistent between signals from rat and human somatosensory cortex; and 2) a tactile stimulus has the same effect on the somatosensory \u03b1- and \u03b2-rhythms in both rats and humans, namely suppressing them. Thus we not only provide evidence for the existence of genuine \u03b1- and \u03b2-rhythms in rat somatosensory cortex, but also for their homology to the primate sensorimotor \u03b1- and \u03b2-rhythms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrel cortex", "Sensorimotor oscillations", "Somatosensory cortex", "\u03b2-rhythm", "\u00b5-rhythm"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Alpha Rhythm", "Animals", "Beta Rhythm", "Brain Mapping", "Electrocorticography", "Electrodes", "Female", "Fourier Analysis", "Humans", "Male", "Periodicity", "Physical Stimulation", "Rats", "Rats, Long-Evans", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Touch"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977664821", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"56175553300": {"Name": "Fransen A.M.M.", "AuthorID": "56175553300", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour"}, "56175227300": {"Name": "Dimitriadis G.", "AuthorID": "56175227300", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour"}, "35759550000": {"Name": "van Ede F.", "AuthorID": "35759550000", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "6603784499": {"Name": "Maris E.", "AuthorID": "6603784499", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour"}}}
