Design/setting: Data from the 2009/10 English General Practice Patient Survey including 2 169 718 respondents registered with 8362 primary care practices. Measures/analyses: Linear mixed-effects regression models (fixed effects adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation, self-reported health, self-reported mental health condition and random practice effect) predicting overall satisfaction from six items covering four domains of care: access, helpfulness of receptionists, doctor communication and nurse communication. Additional models using interactions tested whether associations between patient experience and satisfaction varied by socio-demographic group. Results: Doctor communication showed the strongest relationship with overall satisfaction (standardized coefficient 0.48, 95% CI = 0.48, 0.48), followed by the helpfulness of reception staff (standardized coefficient 0.22, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.22). Among six measures of patient experience, obtaining appointments in advance showed the weakest relationship with overall satisfaction (standardized coefficient 0.06, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.06). Interactions showed statistically significant but small variation in the importance of drivers across different patient groups. Conclusions: For all patient groups, communication with the doctor is the most important driver of overall satisfaction with primary care in England, along with the helpfulness of receptionists. In contrast, and despite being a policy priority for government, measures of access, including the ability to obtain appointments, were poorly related to overall satisfaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Model", "Primary care", "Satisfaction", "Survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Communication", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Primary Health Care", "Regression Analysis", "Social Class", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942296598", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"24554451600": {"Name": "Paddison C.", "AuthorID": "24554451600", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "57202757335": {"Name": "Abel G.", "AuthorID": "57202757335", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "55619036500": {"Name": "Roland M.", "AuthorID": "55619036500", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "7402622413": {"Name": "Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "7402622413", "AffiliationID": "60003873", "AffiliationName": "RAND Corporation"}, "55470023300": {"Name": "Campbell J.", "AuthorID": "55470023300", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}}}
