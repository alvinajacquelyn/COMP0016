The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of SPECT-CT in unexplained painful MOM hip arthroplasty. We compared the diagnosis and management plan for 19 prosthetic MOM hips in 15 subjects with unexplained pain before and after SPECT-CT. SPECT-CT changed the management decision in 13 (68%) subjects, Chi-Square. =. 5.49, P=. 0.24. In 6 subjects (32%) pain remained unexplained however the result reassured the surgeon to continue with non-operative management. SPECT-CT should be reserved as a specialist test to help identify possible causes of pain where conventional investigations have failed. It can help reassure surgeons making management decisions for patients with unexplained pain following MOM hip arthroplasty.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arthroplasty", "Diagnosis", "Hip", "Pain", "SPECT-CT", "Unexplained"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arthralgia", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Female", "Hip Joint", "Humans", "Male", "Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses", "Middle Aged", "Pain Measurement", "Prosthesis Failure", "Reoperation", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928361066", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"26532304500": {"Name": "Berber R.", "AuthorID": "26532304500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Inst. of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science (Univ.
