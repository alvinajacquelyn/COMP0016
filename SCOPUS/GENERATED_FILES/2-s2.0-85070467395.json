Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent promising sources of human liver spheres. We have developed a serum free and defined method of cellular differentiation to generate three-dimensional human liver spheres formed from human pluripotent stem cells. A potential limitation of the technology is the production of dense spheres with dead material inside. In order to circumvent this, we have employed agarose microwell technology at defined cell densities to control the size of the 3D spheres, preventing the generation of apoptotic and/or necrotic cores. Notably, the spheres generated by our approach display liver function and stable phenotype, representing a valuable resource for basic and applied scientific research. We believe that our approach could be used as a platform technology to develop further tissues to model and treat human disease and in the future may permit the generation of human tissue with complex tissue architecture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Defined culture system", "Developmental Biology", "Drug metabolism and protein secretion", "Hepatospheres", "Issue 149", "Pluripotent stem cells", "Stable cell phenotype", "Three-dimensional culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Count", "Cell Differentiation", "Culture Media, Serum-Free", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Liver", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Spheroids, Cellular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070467395", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"55221835900": {"Name": "Lucendo-Villarin B.", "AuthorID": "55221835900", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "26535019500": {"Name": "Rashidi H.", "AuthorID": "26535019500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57184381100": {"Name": "Alhaque S.", "AuthorID": "57184381100", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "57202150850": {"Name": "Fischer L.", "AuthorID": "57202150850", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College"}, "57193851424": {"Name": "Meseguer-Ripolles J.", "AuthorID": "57193851424", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57200196341": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57200196341", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "26657949400": {"Name": "Hay D.C.", "AuthorID": "26657949400", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "55920186100": {"Name": "Themis M.", "AuthorID": "55920186100", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "7006213073": {"Name": "O'farrelly C.", "AuthorID": "7006213073", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College"}}}
