This study investigates if the bioactivity of CoCrMo can be enhanced by coating the surface with titanium oxide (TiO2) by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD), thereby replicating the surface oxide layer found on Ti. CoCrMo, TiO2-coated CoCrMo (CCMT) and Ti substrates were used for this study. Cellular f-actin distribution was shown to be noticeably different between cells on CCMT and CoCrMo after 24 h in osteogenic culture, with cells on CCMT exhibiting greater spread with developed protrusions. Osteogenic differentiation was shown to be enhanced on CCMT compared to CoCrMo, with increased calcium ion content per cell (p<0.05), greater hydroxyapatite nodule formation (p<0.05) and reduced type I collagen deposition per cell (p<0.05). The expression of the focal adhesion protein vincu-lin was shown to be marginally greater on CCMT compared to CoCrMo, whereas AFM results indicated that CCMT required more force to remove a single cell from the substrate surface compared to CoCrMo (p<0.0001). These data suggest that CVD TiO2 coatings may have the potential to increase the biocompatibility of CoCrMo implantable devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AFM", "Cobalt alloy", "Mesenchymal stem cells", "Osteogenesis", "Titanium oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition", "Calcium ion content", "Cobalt chromium molybdenums", "Implantable devices", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Orthopedic applications", "Osteogenesis", "Osteogenic differentiation", "Calcification, Physiologic", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Osteogenesis", "Titanium", "Vitallium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923047585", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"8434909600": {"Name": "Logan N.", "AuthorID": "8434909600", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "56324088700": {"Name": "Sherif A.", "AuthorID": "56324088700", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6602787947": {"Name": "Bozec L.", "AuthorID": "6602787947", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7007011274": {"Name": "Brett P.", "AuthorID": "7007011274", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57196590650": {"Name": "Cross A.", "AuthorID": "57196590650", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57210504411": {"Name": "Collins S.", "AuthorID": "57210504411", "AffiliationID": "60118328", "AffiliationName": "Corin Ltd."}, "37060042100": {"Name": "Traynor A.", "AuthorID": "37060042100", "AffiliationID": "60118328", "AffiliationName": "Corin Ltd."}}}
