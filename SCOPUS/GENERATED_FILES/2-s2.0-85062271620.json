Both CAA and AD are characterized by extracellular A\u03b2 deposits with the distinction that CAA has vascular deposits while AD has amyloid plaques. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation (IP) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) to test the hypothesis that the A\u03b2 peptide pattern differs between subjects having A\u03b2 plaque pathology only and subjects with A\u03b2 plaque pathology together with CAA pathology. Occipital lobes from 12 AD brains, ranging from no CAA to severe CAA, were extracted using 70% formic acid followed by IP-MS analysis. The A\u03b2 peptide pattern differed greatly between subjects with no CAA compared to subjects with CAA. In cases with CAA, the most abundant A\u03b2 peptides ended at amino acid 40 including A\u03b21-40 (P =.048) and A\u03b2 2\u201340 (P =.0253) which were significantly increased compared to cases with no CAA. This was in contrast to subjects with no CAA where the most abundant A\u03b2 peptides ended at amino acid 42 of which A\u03b21-42 (P =.0101) and A\u03b22-42 (P =.0051) as well as the pyroglutamate (pGlu)-modified peptides pGlu A\u03b23-42 (P =.0177), and pGlu A\u03b211-42 (P =.0088) were significantly increased compared to CAA subjects. The results are in line with earlier immunohistochemistry data and show that the molecular composition of the A\u03b2 deposits found in blood vessels are different to the parenchymal deposits, suggesting they arise from distinct pathogenic pathways. This information may be useful in the development of pathology-specific biomarkers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid beta", "Brain", "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mass spectrometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Female", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occipital Lobe", "Plaque, Amyloid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062271620", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57193355048": {"Name": "Gkanatsiou E.", "AuthorID": "57193355048", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602971570": {"Name": "Brinkmalm G.", "AuthorID": "6602971570", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57207195643": {"Name": "Toomey C.E.", "AuthorID": "57207195643", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
