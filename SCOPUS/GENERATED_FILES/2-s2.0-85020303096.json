Amorphous SnO2 is used as a model anode material to demonstrate the significant impact of OVs because it has received much attention in the SIB field. Amorphous SnO2 ordered arrays are fabricated using the nanoimprinted anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template and atomic layer deposition and OVs are confined in the material by annealing the arrays in the N2 atmosphere. The OVs-containing amorphous SnO2 ordered arrays, used as binder- and conductive additive-free anodes, exhibit high reversible capacity and good cycle life by retaining the capacities of 376 mAh g\u22121 after 100 cycles at 0.05 A g\u22121 and 220 mAh g\u22121 after 800 cycles at 1 A g\u22121. They also show great rate capability by delivering the capacities of 210 and 200 mAh g\u22121 at 10 and 20 A g\u22121, respectively. Electrochemical kinetic study reveals that the presence of OVs greatly enhances charge transfer/transport in the amorphous SnO2, thereby boosts the performance comparing with the OVs-free counterpart. This work highlights the importance of modulating defects in amorphous electrode materials toward promoted sodium storage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amorphous electrode materials", "Ordered arrays", "Oxygen vacancies", "Sodium-ion batteries", "Tin oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amorphous electrodes", "Anodic aluminum oxide", "Conductive additives", "Electrochemical kinetics", "Electrochemical performance", "High reversible capacities", "Ordered array", "Sodium ion batteries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020303096", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57192592509": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192592509", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "57217414952": {"Name": "Zhou M.", "AuthorID": "57217414952", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "55940779600": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "55940779600", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "55566778000": {"Name": "Liang L.", "AuthorID": "55566778000", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "36457445600": {"Name": "Fang Y.", "AuthorID": "36457445600", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "57197460793": {"Name": "Cheng L.", "AuthorID": "57197460793", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "56152354500": {"Name": "Lei Y.", "AuthorID": "56152354500", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanochemistry and Nanobiology, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University"}, "57192594770": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57192594770", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanochemistry and Nanobiology, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University"}, "21743366500": {"Name": "Wu M.", "AuthorID": "21743366500", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanochemistry and Nanobiology, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University"}}}
