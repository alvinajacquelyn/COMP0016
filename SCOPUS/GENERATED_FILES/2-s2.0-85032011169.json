Characterised by early dissemination and rapid development of chemo-resistant disease, less than 5% of patients survive 5 years. Despite 3 decades of clinical trials there has been no change to the standard platinum and etoposide regimen for first line treatment developed in the 1970's. The exceptionally high number of genomic aberrations observed in SCLC combined with the characteristic rapid cellular proliferation results in accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability. To flourish in this precarious genomic context, SCLC cells are reliant on functional DNA damage repair pathways and cell cycle checkpoints. Current cytotoxic drugs and radiotherapy treatments for SCLC have long been known to act by induction of DNA damage and the response of cancer cells to such damage determines treatment efficacy. Recent years have witnessed improved understanding of strategies to exploit DNA damage and repair mechanisms in order to increase treatment efficacy. This review will summarise the rationale to target DNA damage response in SCLC, the progress made in evaluating novel DDR inhibitors and highlight various ongoing challenges for their clinical development in this disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Checkpoint Inhibitors", "DNA Repair Pathways", "Lung Cancer", "PARP Inhibitors", "Small Cell Lung Cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aurora Kinases", "Azepines", "Benzimidazoles", "Carbolines", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytotoxins", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "Etoposide", "Genomic Instability", "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Phthalazines", "Piperazines", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrimidines", "Rad51 Recombinase", "Small Cell Lung Carcinoma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032011169", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57195479532": {"Name": "Foy V.", "AuthorID": "57195479532", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "57195469798": {"Name": "Schenk M.W.", "AuthorID": "57195469798", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "57196150334": {"Name": "Baker K.", "AuthorID": "57196150334", "AffiliationID": "60172353", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence"}, "57195469101": {"Name": "Lallo A.", "AuthorID": "57195469101", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "24830247700": {"Name": "Frese K.K.", "AuthorID": "24830247700", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "7004424860": {"Name": "Dive C.", "AuthorID": "7004424860", "AffiliationID": "60172353", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence"}, "57189869138": {"Name": "Gomes F.", "AuthorID": "57189869138", "AffiliationID": "119673060", "AffiliationName": "Oncologia Medica, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Central"}, "57200772132": {"Name": "Blackhall F.", "AuthorID": "57200772132", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57189580188": {"Name": "Forster M.", "AuthorID": "57189580188", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
