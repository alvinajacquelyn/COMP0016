Group 1 (n = 155, 68.9%) had TN without concomitant pain, group 2 (n = 32, 14.2%) had TN with intermittent concomitant pain, and group 3 (n = 39, 16.9%) had TN with autonomic symptoms. We tested 2 hypotheses: (1) that different pain profiles would be associated with the different groups; (2) that the severe pain associated with TN would impact negatively on activities of daily living and thereby result in disability as defined by the World Health Organisation. A different pain profile was found across the groups. We obtained unequivocal evidence that TN causes disability with up to 45% of patients being absent from usual daily activities 15 days or more in the past 6 months. On the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 35.7% patients had mild-to-severe depression and over 50% were anxious. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale showed that 78% of patients had considerable negative thoughts with scores >20 and a mean score of 36.4. Prior to referral, only 54% had been prescribed carbamazepine while opioids had been prescribed in 14.6% of the patients. Prior to referral, over 80% had already been to 1 specialist centre which had not provided appropriate management. Patients with TN report varied characteristics but all result in some degree of psychosocial disability especially before adequate therapy is attained.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disability", "Quality of life", "Sociodemographic", "Trigeminal neuralgia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Catastrophization", "Comorbidity", "Cost of Illness", "Facial Pain", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Quality of Life", "Risk Factors", "Sex Distribution", "Trigeminal Neuralgia", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019902541", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"56810833400": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "56810833400", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine, Facial Pain Unit, Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194400210": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57194400210", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Applied Health and Clinical Translation, School of Dentistry, University of Leeds"}, "22986447400": {"Name": "Pavitt S.H.", "AuthorID": "22986447400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Applied Health and Clinical Translation, School of Dentistry, University of Leeds"}, "7006287402": {"Name": "Mon-Williams M.", "AuthorID": "7006287402", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Leeds"}, "7201972745": {"Name": "Phillips N.", "AuthorID": "7201972745", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Leeds General Infirmary"}}}
