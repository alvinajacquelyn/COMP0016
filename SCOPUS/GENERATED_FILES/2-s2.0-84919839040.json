Published by Taylor & Francis.A recent turn towards a more contextually sensitive apprehension of the challenge of making everyday life less resource hungry has been partly underwritten by widespread evidence that the environmental values people commonly profess to hold do not often translate into correspondingly low impact actions. Yet sometimes the contexts of everyday life can also conspire to make people limit their consumption without ever explicitly connecting this to the environmental agenda. This paper considers this phenomenon with reference to UK studies from both ends of the generational spectrum. The first questioned how older people keep warm at home during winter and the second examined how young people get rid of no longer wanted possessions. Both found that, though the respondents involved were acting in certain ways that may be deemed comparatively low impact, they were hitherto relatively indifferent to the idea of characterising these actions as such. We outline three ways in which sustainability advocates might respond to the existence of such \u201cinadvertent environmentalists\u201d and consider how they might inspire studies that generate fresh intervention ideas instead of lingering on the dispiriting recognition that people do not often feel able to act for the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["consumption", "older people", "sustainability", "value\u2013action gap", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919839040", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57205914586": {"Name": "Hitchings R.", "AuthorID": "57205914586", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, UCL"}, "54894200700": {"Name": "Collins R.", "AuthorID": "54894200700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, UCL"}, "7402616688": {"Name": "Day R.", "AuthorID": "7402616688", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Birmingham University"}}}
