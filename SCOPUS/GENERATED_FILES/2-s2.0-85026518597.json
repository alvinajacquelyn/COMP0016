All rights reserved.The hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis is a dynamic system regulating glucocorticoid hormone synthesis in the adrenal glands. Many key factors within the adrenal steroidogenic pathway have been identified and studied, but little is known about how these factors function collectively as a dynamic network of interacting components. To investigate this, we developed a mathematical model of the adrenal steroidogenic regulatory network that accounts for key regulatory processes occurring at different timescales. We used our model to predict the time evolution of steroidogenesis in response to physiological adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) perturbations, ranging from basal pulses to larger stress-like stimulations (e.g., inflammatory stress). Testing these predictions experimentally in the rat, our results show that the steroidogenic regulatory network architecture is sufficient to respond to both small and large ACTH perturbations, but coupling this regulatory network with the immune pathway is necessary to explain the dissociated dynamics between ACTH and glucocorticoids observed under conditions of inflammatory stress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenal gland", "Glucocorticoids", "Mathematical modeling", "Steroidogenesis", "Stress response"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Glands", "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone", "Animals", "Glucocorticoids", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Male", "Models, Theoretical", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026518597", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22433919800": {"Name": "Spiga F.", "AuthorID": "22433919800", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol"}, "55023363200": {"Name": "Walker J.J.", "AuthorID": "55023363200", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "36614907800": {"Name": "Zhao Z.", "AuthorID": "36614907800", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol"}, "36067479700": {"Name": "Lightman S.L.", "AuthorID": "36067479700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare, University of Exeter"}, "56010115100": {"Name": "Zavala E.", "AuthorID": "56010115100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare, University of Exeter"}, "57203214780": {"Name": "Terry J.R.", "AuthorID": "57203214780", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare, University of Exeter"}}}
