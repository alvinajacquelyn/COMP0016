We set out two broad hypotheses: first, that an understanding of the economy and working conditions is incomplete without knowing what happens within and across workplaces; and second, that \u2018local\u2019 factors play a key role in shaping the practice of workplace employment relations, but in a more nuanced way that is ordinarily portrayed in the literature. The chapter situates our study within the existing comparative literature, provides a brief portrait of the two economies, and introduces the WERS and REPONSE survey data that provides the basis for our comparative analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017577185", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"26431821900": {"Name": "Amoss\u00e9 T.", "AuthorID": "26431821900", "AffiliationID": "109886049", "AffiliationName": "Centre d\u2019Etudes de l\u2019Emploi"}, "7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57154476100": {"Name": "Forth J.", "AuthorID": "57154476100", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "25634620600": {"Name": "Petit H.", "AuthorID": "25634620600", "AffiliationID": "60107823, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "CLERSE, University Lille 1"}}}
