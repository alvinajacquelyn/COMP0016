Yet our understanding of complex search tasks, in comparison to simple look up tasks, is fragmented at best. The workshop addresses many open research questions: What are the obvious use cases and applications of complex search? What are essential features of work tasks and search tasks to take into account? And how do these evolve over time? With a multitude of information, varying from introductory to specialized, and from authoritative to speculative or opinionated, when to show what sources of information? How does the information seeking process evolve and what are relevant differences between different stages? With complex task and search process management, blending searching, browsing, and recommendations, and supporting exploratory search to sensemaking and analytics, UI and UX design pose an overconstrained challenge. How do we evaluate and compare approaches? Which measures should be taken into account? Supporting complex search tasks requires new collaborations across the fields of CHI and IR, and the proposed workshop will bring together a diverse group of researchers to work together on one of the greatest challenges of our field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex searches", "Different stages", "Essential features", "Exploratory search", "Information seeking process", "Over-constrained", "Research questions", "Sources of informations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016951239", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"7102357181": {"Name": "Belkin N.", "AuthorID": "7102357181", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Rutgers University"}, "14035145000": {"Name": "Bogers T.", "AuthorID": "14035145000", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Aalborg Univ."}, "7006392783": {"Name": "Kamps J.", "AuthorID": "7006392783", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "35581749900": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "35581749900", "AffiliationID": "60015574", "AffiliationName": "Univ.
