However, how people's satisfaction levels with travel adapt after changing their travel behaviour has not yet been analysed thoroughly. In this study we analyse travel satisfaction of 1650 respondents who recently relocated to selected neighbourhoods in the city of Ghent (Belgium), and therefore changed their daily travel patterns (i.e., commute and leisure trips). Based on a two-step approach, i.e., a factor analysis followed by a cluster analysis, respondents are segmented into four clusters based on their changes in travel behaviour after they moved. Results indicate that especially clusters with respondents that decreased travel distance and duration, and increased the use of car alternatives have high levels of travel satisfaction, for both commute trips and leisure trips. Respondents from these clusters also indicated the highest levels of travel satisfaction improvements. This study provides additional motivation for policy makers and urban planners to convince more people to relocate to urban areas, or for densification and land use mixing of existing neighbourhoods, as this will not only result in more sustainable travel patterns, but also in more satisfying travel patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Residential relocation", "Travel attitudes", "Travel behavior", "Travel mode choice", "Travel satisfaction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063763189", "SubjectAreas": [["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"54787558100": {"Name": "De Vos J.", "AuthorID": "54787558100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "6602186586": {"Name": "Witlox F.", "AuthorID": "6602186586", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "6602405034": {"Name": "Ettema D.", "AuthorID": "6602405034", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Geosciences, Utrecht University"}}}
