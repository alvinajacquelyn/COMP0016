Populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) have declined in many European towns and cities, but the causes of these declines remain unclear. We investigated associations between parasite infection and house sparrow demography across suburban London where sparrow abundance has declined by 71% since 1995. Plasmodium relictum infection was found at higher prevalences (averaging 74%) in suburban London house sparrows than previously recorded in any wild bird population in Northern Europe. Survival rates of juvenile and adult sparrows and population growth rate were negatively related to Plasmodium relictum infection intensity. Other parasites were much less prevalent and exhibited no relationship with sparrow survival and no negative relationship with population growth. Low rates of co-infection suggested sparrows were not immunocompromised. Our findings indicate that P. relictum infection may be influencing house sparrow population dynamics in suburban areas. The demographic sensitivity of the house sparrow to P. relictum infection in London might reflect a recent increase in exposure to this parasite.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decline", "House sparrow", "Passer domesticus", "Plasmodium", "Population", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070773875", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35219732600": {"Name": "Dadam D.", "AuthorID": "35219732600", "AffiliationID": "60016777", "AffiliationName": "British Trust for Ornithology"}, "57210446861": {"Name": "Clements A.", "AuthorID": "57210446861", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6701682562": {"Name": "Rowcliffe J.M.", "AuthorID": "6701682562", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57201259498": {"Name": "Robinson R.A.", "AuthorID": "57201259498", "AffiliationID": "60016777", "AffiliationName": "British Trust for Ornithology"}, "7003836801": {"Name": "Peach W.J.", "AuthorID": "7003836801", "AffiliationID": "60021721", "AffiliationName": "RSPB Centre for Conservation Science, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"}, "55660172600": {"Name": "Bennett M.", "AuthorID": "55660172600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus"}}}
