Sensing power use and predicting demand is an important component in the Smart Grid. In this work, we describe a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) system applied to a smart office. In the building, power usage is directly proportional to the number of people present. CGP is used to perform data fusion on the data collected from smart sensors embedded in the building in order to predict the number of people over a two-month period. This is a challenging task, as the sensors are unreliable, resulting in incomplete data. It is also challenging because in addition to normal staff, the building underwent renovation during the test period, resulting the presence of additional personnel who would not normally be present. Despite these difficult real-world issues, CGP was able to learn human-readable rules that when used in combination, provide a method for data fusion that is tolerant to the observed faults in the sensors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)", "data fusion", "ensemble learning", "fault tolerant", "sensor fusion", "Smart Grid", "smart office"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cartesian genetic programming", "Ensemble learning", "Fault-tolerant", "Sensor fusion", "Smart grid", "Smart offices"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046131549", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"24466639300": {"Name": "Bentley P.J.", "AuthorID": "24466639300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172701", "AffiliationName": "Braintree Ltd, Department of Computer Science, UCL"}, "27169737500": {"Name": "Lim S.L.", "AuthorID": "27169737500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172701", "AffiliationName": "Braintree Ltd, Department of Computer Science, UCL"}}}
