Here, we analyse 1x sequence data across the APOC3 gene in a founder population from the island of Crete in Greece (n=1239) and find significant evidence for association with blood triglyceride levels with the previously reported R19X cardioprotective null mutation (\u03b2=-1.09, r=0.163, P=8.2 x 10-11) and a second loss of function mutation, rs138326449 (\u03b2=-1.17,\u03c3=0.188, P=1.14 x 10-9). The signal cannot be recapitulated by imputing genome-wide genotype data on a large reference panel of 5122 individuals including 249 with 4x WGS data from the same population. Gene-level meta-analysis with other studies reporting burden signals at APOC3 provides robust evidence for a replicable cardioprotective rare variant aggregation (P=3.2 x 10-31, n=13 480).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Apolipoprotein C-III", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Founder Effect", "Genetics, Population", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Greece", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998978801", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56080391400": {"Name": "Gilly A.", "AuthorID": "56080391400", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus"}, "37665969200": {"Name": "Ritchie G.", "AuthorID": "37665969200", "AffiliationID": "60026124, 60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute"}, "6602842855": {"Name": "Southam L.", "AuthorID": "6602842855", "AffiliationID": "60099539", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics"}, "57203258251": {"Name": "Zeggini E.", "AuthorID": "57203258251", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus"}, "37001619300": {"Name": "Farmaki A.", "AuthorID": "37001619300", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "6701705920": {"Name": "Dedoussis G.", "AuthorID": "6701705920", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "57210774566": {"Name": "Tsafantakis E.", "AuthorID": "57210774566", "AffiliationID": "100633439", "AffiliationName": "Anogia Medical Centre"}}}
