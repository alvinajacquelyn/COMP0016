For the first time in history, several drugs are now in phase III randomized controlled trials. Approaches tested include the anti-B cell antibody rituximab, the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab, the antifibrotic drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, and the cannabinoid receptor mimetic lenabasum. That all these drugs are in advanced clinical trials despite the relatively low incidence of the disease therefore is good news. Not only is there realistic hope that at least some of the approaches will work, this also indicates growing industry interest, for most of the trials are company-sponsored. This review attempts to delineate the ongoing trials and to summarize the underlying evidence of these candidate systemic sclerosis drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B cells", "Cytokines", "Fibrotic", "Inflammatory", "Scleroderma", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056060012", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7003332848": {"Name": "Aringer M.", "AuthorID": "7003332848", "AffiliationID": "60025676, 60018353", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine III, University Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital, Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}}}
