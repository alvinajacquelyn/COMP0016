It can report on photophysical events that are difficult or impossible to observe by fluorescence intensity imaging, because FLIM is largely independent of the local fluorophore concentration and excitation intensity. Many FLIM applications relevant for biology concern the identification of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study protein interactions and conformational changes. In addition, FLIM has been used to image viscosity, temperature, pH, refractive index, and ion and oxygen concentrations, all at the cellular level. The basic principles and recent advances in the application of FLIM, FLIM instrumentation, molecular probe, and FLIM detector development will be discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anisotropy", "Fluorescence anisotropy imaging (FAIM)", "Fluorescence enhancement", "Fluorescence microscopy", "Fluorescence spectroscopy", "F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)", "Plasmonics", "Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)", "Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging (TR-FAIM)", "Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fluorescence anisotropy", "Fluorescence enhancement", "Time resolved fluorescence anisotropy", "Time-correlated single-photon counting", "Total internal reflection fluorescence"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034393737", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6701805003": {"Name": "Suhling K.", "AuthorID": "6701805003", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King\u2019s College London"}, "24070727500": {"Name": "Hirvonen L.M.", "AuthorID": "24070727500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King\u2019s College London"}, "19933917400": {"Name": "Levitt J.A.", "AuthorID": "19933917400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King\u2019s College London"}, "18733571200": {"Name": "Chung P.H.", "AuthorID": "18733571200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King\u2019s College London"}, "57221739323": {"Name": "Tregidgo C.", "AuthorID": "57221739323", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King\u2019s College London"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25937590000": {"Name": "Zheng K.", "AuthorID": "25937590000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602110727": {"Name": "Ameer-Beg S.", "AuthorID": "6602110727", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Richard Dimbleby Department of Cancer Research, Division of Cancer Studies, New Hunt\u2019s House, King\u2019s College London"}, "55758310000": {"Name": "Coelho S.", "AuthorID": "55758310000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Richard Dimbleby Department of Cancer Research, Division of Cancer Studies, New Hunt\u2019s House, King\u2019s College London"}, "12040303400": {"Name": "Poland S.P.", "AuthorID": "12040303400", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Research and Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King\u2019s College London"}, "7402183805": {"Name": "Henderson R.", "AuthorID": "7402183805", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "CMOS Sensors and Systems Group, Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}, "9133776300": {"Name": "Krstajic N.", "AuthorID": "9133776300", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC IRC \u201cHub\u201d in Optical Molecular Sensing and Imaging, MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}}}
