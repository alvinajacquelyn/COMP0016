J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 103B: 1424-1432, 2015. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Bioresorbable composites have shown much potential for bone repair applications, as they have the ability to degrade completely over time and their degradation and mechanical properties can be tailored to suit the end application. In this study, phosphate glass fiber (from the system 45% P<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>-16% CaO-24% MgO-11% Na<inf>2</inf>O-4% Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (given in mol%)) were used to reinforce polycaprolactone (PCL) with approximately 20% fiber volume fraction. The glass fiber surfaces were coated with magnesium (Mg) through magnetron sputtering to improve the fiber-matrix interfacial properties. The Mg coating provided a rough fiber surface (roughness (Ra) of about 44nm). Both noncoated and Mg-coated fiber-reinforced composites were assessed. The water uptake and mass loss properties for the composites were assessed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37C for up to 28 days, and ion release profiles were also investigated in both water and PBS media. Inhibition of media influx was observed for the Mg-coated composites. The composite mechanical properties were characterized on the basis of both tensile and flexural tests and their retention in PBS media at 37C was also investigated. A higher retention of the mechanical properties was observed for the Mg-coated composites over the 28 days degradation period.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnesium coating, degradation, mechanical property", "phosphate glass fiber", "unidirectional composite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioresorbable", "Coated composites", "Fiber volume fractions", "Flexural tests", "Interfacial property", "Phosphate glass fibers", "Phosphate-buffered salines", "Unidirectional composites", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Glass", "Magnesium", "Polyesters", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941628963", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55857704600": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "55857704600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "7402310526": {"Name": "Grant D.", "AuthorID": "7402310526", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "56221560100": {"Name": "Parsons A.", "AuthorID": "56221560100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "7102239471": {"Name": "Rudd C.", "AuthorID": "7102239471", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "7201958203": {"Name": "Ahmed I.", "AuthorID": "7201958203", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "7202018577": {"Name": "Palmer G.", "AuthorID": "7202018577", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
