The energy of the projectile electron is in the range 0.1-10 eV. The effect of multichannel coupling is investigated by calculating the cross sections with various target models by increasing the number of target states in the trial wave function of the entire scattering system. The cross sections converge for the calculation with more than 15-target states. The vertical excitation energies calculated with the present model give excellent agreement with the EOM-CCSD calculations. Collisional frequencies are determined using the momentum transfer cross section for a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. From the collisional frequency, the transport properties such as mean free path, diffusivity and mobility are calculated for the temperature range of 100 to 500 000 K. The cross section data and transport properties reported in this article are important for fusion plasma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beryllium dihydride", "cross section", "fusion plasma", "R-matrix"], "IndexKeywords": ["cross section", "Dihydrides", "Dissociative electron attachment", "Fusion plasmas", "Low energy electron impacts", "Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution", "Momentum transfer cross sections", "R matrices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065181697", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55655621400": {"Name": "Gupta D.", "AuthorID": "55655621400", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology ResearchCenter, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "36615843600": {"Name": "Song M.Y.", "AuthorID": "36615843600", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology ResearchCenter, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "15080535400": {"Name": "Choi H.", "AuthorID": "15080535400", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology ResearchCenter, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "8715771400": {"Name": "Kwon D.C.", "AuthorID": "8715771400", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology ResearchCenter, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "6701565644": {"Name": "Baluja K.L.", "AuthorID": "6701565644", "AffiliationID": "60029284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
