However, fewer smokers participate in screening despite their increased risk, which may reflect different beliefs about cancer.Methods:A UK population-representative sample of \u226550 year-olds (n=6965) was surveyed using the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer measure. These analyses examine six items on cancer beliefs (e.g., 'cancer can often be cured'), and four on help-seeking barriers (e.g., 'I would be too embarrassed').Results:Smokers were more likely to hold pessimistic cancer beliefs than never-smokers or former-smokers on four of six items. For example, 34% agreed 'a cancer diagnosis is a death sentence', compared with 24% of non/former-smokers (P<0.001). More smokers (18%) than non/former-smokers (11%) would not want to know if they had cancer (P<0.01). The only barrier to symptomatic help-seeking differing by smoking status was 'worry about what the doctor might find' (36% vs 28%, P<0.01). Associations were independent of demographics, self-rated health and cancer experience.Conclusions:Smokers held more pessimistic and avoidant beliefs about cancer, which could deter early-detection behaviour. A better understanding of these beliefs is needed to increase engagement in early diagnosis by this high-risk group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes", "avoidance", "cancer", "early detection", "pessimism", "smoking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Attitude to Health", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930048147", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55908894400": {"Name": "Quaife S.L.", "AuthorID": "55908894400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57216283722": {"Name": "Mcewen A.", "AuthorID": "57216283722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
