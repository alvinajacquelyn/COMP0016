However, remarkably little is known about the origin of heterogeneity or whether intrinsic and extrinsic variation can be controlled to generate reproducible cell type proportioning seen in vivo. Here, we use experimentation and modeling in D. discoideum to demonstrate that population-level cell cycle heterogeneity can be optimized to generate robust cell fate proportioning. First, cell cycle position is quantitatively linked to responsiveness to differentiation-inducing signals. Second, intrinsic variation in cell cycle length ensures cells are randomly distributed throughout the cell cycle at the onset of multicellular development. Finally, extrinsic perturbation of optimal cell cycle heterogeneity is buffered by compensatory changes in global signal responsiveness. These studies thus illustrate key regulatory principles underlying cell-cell heterogeneity optimization and the generation of robust and reproducible fate choice in development. Gruenheit et al. find cell cycle position heterogeneity promotes symmetry breaking during development as it helps cells respond to different differentiation cues. Buffering by changes in signal responses ensures this system is robust to perturbation of cell cycle dynamics. This illustrates how heterogeneity can be optimized to facilitate development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell cycle", "cell fate", "Dictyostelium", "heterogeneity", "lineage priming", "oscillator", "single-cell sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Division", "Cell Lineage", "Dictyostelium", "Spores, Fungal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055125582", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"23977918100": {"Name": "Gruenheit N.", "AuthorID": "23977918100", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "35301703900": {"Name": "Brimson C.A.", "AuthorID": "35301703900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Life's Origins and Evolution, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57190372004": {"Name": "Kuwana S.", "AuthorID": "57190372004", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Life's Origins and Evolution, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57204293851": {"Name": "Salvidge W.M.", "AuthorID": "57204293851", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Life's Origins and Evolution, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57193098824": {"Name": "Stewart B.", "AuthorID": "57193098824", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "7404238200": {"Name": "Thompson C.R.L.", "AuthorID": "7404238200", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "36870976700": {"Name": "Parkinson K.", "AuthorID": "36870976700", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "57204281953": {"Name": "Johnson E.J.", "AuthorID": "57204281953", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "24477801900": {"Name": "Nagayama K.", "AuthorID": "24477801900", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "57204285788": {"Name": "Llewellyn J.", "AuthorID": "57204285788", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, The University of Manchester"}, "25936274600": {"Name": "Keller T.", "AuthorID": "25936274600", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "16318252600": {"Name": "van Zon W.", "AuthorID": "16318252600", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "35179054500": {"Name": "Cotter S.L.", "AuthorID": "35179054500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, The University of Manchester"}}}
