As yet there is no definitive consensus in the literature. Combining spatially resolved mass spectrometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we observe a specific environment of the active catalyst during CO oxidation, having the same specific local coordination of the Pd in both the absence and presence of H2. In combination with Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP), performed under isothermal conditions, a mechanistic insight into the promotional effect of H2 was found, providing clear evidence of nonthermal effects in the hydrogen-promoted oxidation of carbon monoxide. We have identified that H2 promotes the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, and we propose this is linked to the increased interaction of O with the Pd surface in the presence of H2. This combination of spatially resolved MS and XAS and TAP studies has provided previously unobserved insights into the nature of this promotional effect.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Isothermal conditions", "Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanism", "Local coordination", "Non thermal effect", "Promotional effect", "Spatially resolved", "Spatially resolved mass spectrometry", "Temporal analysis of product"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050850722", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56410357900": {"Name": "Stewart C.", "AuthorID": "56410357900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "55702520719": {"Name": "Morgan K.", "AuthorID": "55702520719", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "10038979900": {"Name": "Goguet A.", "AuthorID": "10038979900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "8306766600": {"Name": "Gibson E.K.", "AuthorID": "8306766600", "AffiliationID": "60170248", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "55661289100": {"Name": "McManus C.", "AuthorID": "55661289100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "6603438328": {"Name": "Cibin G.", "AuthorID": "6603438328", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7006346007": {"Name": "Dent A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006346007", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56243169300": {"Name": "Hardacre C.", "AuthorID": "56243169300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, University of Manchester"}, "56204136500": {"Name": "Rogers S.", "AuthorID": "56204136500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, University of Manchester"}, "6603556541": {"Name": "Stere C.E.", "AuthorID": "6603556541", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, University of Manchester"}, "36909377500": {"Name": "Chansai S.", "AuthorID": "36909377500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, University of Manchester"}, "7003539910": {"Name": "Kondratenko E.V.", "AuthorID": "7003539910", "AffiliationID": "60003615, 60025221", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz-Institut fur Katalyse E.V, Universitat Rostock"}, "56243028500": {"Name": "Kondratenko V.A.", "AuthorID": "56243028500", "AffiliationID": "60003615, 60025221", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz-Institut fur Katalyse E.V, Universitat Rostock"}, "57196712831": {"Name": "Wang Y.C.", "AuthorID": "57196712831", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "54921352900": {"Name": "Haigh S.J.", "AuthorID": "54921352900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}}}
