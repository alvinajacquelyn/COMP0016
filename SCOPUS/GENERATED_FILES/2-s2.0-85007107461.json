Phase-based x-ray imaging methods can provide opportunities in this sense, since they do not require x-rays to be stopped in tissue for image contrast to be generated. Therefore, x-ray energy can be considerably increased compared to those usually exploited by conventional mammography. In this article we show how a novel, optimized approach can lead to considerable dose reductions. This was achieved by matching the edge-illumination phase method, which reaches very high angular sensitivity also at high x-ray energies, to an appropriate image processing algorithm and to a virtually noise-free detection technology capable of reaching almost 100% efficiency at the same energies. Importantly, while proof-of-concept was obtained at a synchrotron, the method has potential for a translation to conventional sources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dose reduction", "mammography", "phase retrieval", "x-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angular sensitivity", "Detection technology", "Dose reduction", "Image processing algorithm", "Phase retrieval", "Proof of concept", "Radiosensitive organs", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging", "Algorithms", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mammography", "Middle Aged", "Radiation Dosage", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Synchrotrons", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007107461", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003905715": {"Name": "Bravin A.", "AuthorID": "7003905715", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "55113174800": {"Name": "Ruat M.", "AuthorID": "55113174800", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "55453700600": {"Name": "Mittone A.", "AuthorID": "55453700600", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "25652639100": {"Name": "Brun E.", "AuthorID": "25652639100", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "6602714698": {"Name": "Ponchut C.", "AuthorID": "6602714698", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "56114854700": {"Name": "Sztr\u00f3kay-Gaul A.", "AuthorID": "56114854700", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Radiology, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "55616306300": {"Name": "Grandl S.", "AuthorID": "55616306300", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Radiology, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "55343318200": {"Name": "Auweter S.", "AuthorID": "55343318200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Radiology, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "36050187000": {"Name": "Reiser M.", "AuthorID": "36050187000", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Radiology, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "6701464571": {"Name": "Coan P.", "AuthorID": "6701464571", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "6603883835": {"Name": "Mayr D.", "AuthorID": "6603883835", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}}}
