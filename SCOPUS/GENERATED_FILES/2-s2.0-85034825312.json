This paper presents three case studies of an on-going clinical study. The initial results suggest an increased sense of embodiment of the virtual limb promotes a decrease in perceived levels of pain. The results strengthen the view that the cortical map does not fully 'disappear' yet lays dormant.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Case-studies", "Clinical study", "Haptic feedbacks", "Phantom limb pains", "Robotic therapies", "Sense of agencies", "Upper limbs", "Adult", "Aged", "Amputees", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phantom Limb", "Rehabilitation", "Robotics", "Touch", "Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034825312", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56448331600": {"Name": "Snow P.W.", "AuthorID": "56448331600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067, 60099424", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "14034214600": {"Name": "Loureiro R.C.V.", "AuthorID": "14034214600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067, 60099424", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55804383000": {"Name": "Sedki I.", "AuthorID": "55804383000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Prosthetic Unit and Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "16647168000": {"Name": "Sinisi M.", "AuthorID": "16647168000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Prosthetic Unit and Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6602769150": {"Name": "Comley R.", "AuthorID": "6602769150", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University London"}}}
