All rights reserved.How learning enhances neural representations for behaviorally relevant stimuli via activity changes of cortical cell types remains unclear. We simultaneously imaged responses of pyramidal cells (PYR) along with parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) inhibitory interneurons in primary visual cortex while mice learned to discriminate visual patterns. Learning increased selectivity for task-relevant stimuli of PYR, PV and SOM subsets but not VIP cells. Strikingly, PV neurons became as selective as PYR cells, and their functional interactions reorganized, leading to the emergence of stimulus-selective PYR-PV ensembles. Conversely, SOM activity became strongly decorrelated from the network, and PYR-SOM coupling before learning predicted selectivity increases in individual PYR cells. Thus, learning differentially shapes the activity and interactions of multiple cell classes: while SOM inhibition may gate selectivity changes, PV interneurons become recruited into stimulus-specific ensembles and provide more selective inhibition as the network becomes better at discriminating behaviorally relevant stimuli.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Discrimination Learning", "Female", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid", "Interneurons", "Learning", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nerve Net", "Parvalbumins", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Pattern Recognition, Physiological", "Pyramidal Cells", "Sensory Gating", "Somatostatin", "Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047221734", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"23567923800": {"Name": "Khan A.G.", "AuthorID": "23567923800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35572724500": {"Name": "Blot A.", "AuthorID": "35572724500", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel Switzerland"}, "57202973510": {"Name": "Mrsic-Flogel T.D.", "AuthorID": "57202973510", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel Switzerland"}, "10339377600": {"Name": "Hofer S.B.", "AuthorID": "10339377600", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel Switzerland"}, "26027663300": {"Name": "Poort J.", "AuthorID": "26027663300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "57220494617": {"Name": "Chadwick A.", "AuthorID": "57220494617", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "7005205264": {"Name": "Sahani M.", "AuthorID": "7005205264", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
