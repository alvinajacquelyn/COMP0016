All rights reserved.Lentiviral vectors are useful experimental tools for stable gene delivery and have been used to treat human inherited genetic disorders and hematologic malignancies with promising results. Because some of the lentiviral vector components are cytotoxic, transient plasmid transfection has been used to produce the large batches needed for clinical trials. However, this method is costly, poorly reproducible and hard to scale up. Here we describe a general method for construction of stable packaging cell lines that continuously produce lentiviral vectors. This uses Cre recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to insert a codon-optimised HIV-1 Gag-Pol expression construct in a continuously expressed locus in 293FT cells. Subsequently Rev, envelope and vector genome expression cassettes are serially transfected. Vector titers in excess of 10 6 transducing units/ml can be harvested from the final producer clones, which can be increased to 10 8 \u00e2\u20ac...TU/ml by concentration. This method will be of use to all basic and clinical investigators who wish to produce large batches of lentiviral vectors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Vectors", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV-1", "Homologous Recombination", "Humans", "Lentivirus", "pol Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Protein Precursors", "Retroviridae", "rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Virus Assembly"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924546283", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219835648": {"Name": "Sanber K.S.", "AuthorID": "57219835648", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "25951442000": {"Name": "Knight S.B.", "AuthorID": "25951442000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "25932384800": {"Name": "Stephen S.L.", "AuthorID": "25932384800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "8265440800": {"Name": "Bailey R.", "AuthorID": "8265440800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "26643231400": {"Name": "Collins M.K.", "AuthorID": "26643231400", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "34868874800": {"Name": "Takeuchi Y.", "AuthorID": "34868874800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55907715700": {"Name": "Santilli G.", "AuthorID": "55907715700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004171969": {"Name": "Minshull J.", "AuthorID": "7004171969", "AffiliationID": "60096596", "AffiliationName": "DNA2.0"}}}
