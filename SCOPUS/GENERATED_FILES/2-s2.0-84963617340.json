It is made of three parts: a set of premises representing the reason, a conclusion representing the supported claim, and a connection showing how the premises lead to the conclusion. Arguments are frequently exchanged by human agents in natural language (spoken or written) in discussion, debate, negotiation, persuasion, etc. They may be very different in that their three components may have various forms. In this paper, we propose a language for representing such arguments. We show that it is general enough to capture the various forms of arguments encountered in natural language, and that it is possible to represent attack and support relations between arguments as formulas of the same language.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arguments", "Representation language"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arguments", "Human agent", "Logical representations", "Natural languages", "Representation languages", "Support relations", "Three component"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963617340", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"6603218257": {"Name": "Amgoud L.", "AuthorID": "6603218257", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS"}, "57191630413": {"Name": "Besnard P.", "AuthorID": "57191630413", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS"}, "7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
