KGaA, WeinheimOver the past three decades, significant research efforts have focused on improving the charge carrier mobility of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). In recent years, a commonly observed nonlinearity in OTFT current\u2013voltage characteristics, known as the \u201ckink\u201d or \u201cdouble slope,\u201d has led to widespread mobility overestimations, contaminating the relevant literature. Here, published data from the past 30 years is reviewed to uncover the extent of the field-effect mobility hype and identify the progress that has actually been achieved in the field of OTFTs. Present carrier-mobility-related challenges are identified, finding that reliable hole and electron mobility values of 20 and 10 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively, have yet to be achieved. Based on the analysis, the literature is then reviewed to summarize the concepts behind the success of high-performance p-type polymers, along with the latest understanding of the design criteria that will enable further mobility enhancement in n-type polymers and small molecules, and the reasons why high carrier mobility values have been consistently produced from small molecule/polymer blend semiconductors. Overall, this review brings together important information that aids reliable OTFT data analysis, while providing guidelines for the development of next-generation organic semiconductors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier mobility", "charge transport", "contact resistance", "organic field-effect transistors", "organic semiconductors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Field-effect mobilities", "High carrier mobility", "Mobility enhancement", "Organic thin film transistor (OTFTs)", "Organic transistor", "Recent progress", "Research efforts", "Small molecules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050455874", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57190168807": {"Name": "Paterson A.F.", "AuthorID": "57190168807", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "57216793729": {"Name": "McCulloch I.", "AuthorID": "57216793729", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "6701337286": {"Name": "Anthopoulos T.D.", "AuthorID": "6701337286", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "56206207600": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "56206207600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37116115600": {"Name": "Schroeder B.C.", "AuthorID": "37116115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56779792400": {"Name": "Fallon K.J.", "AuthorID": "56779792400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57194680298": {"Name": "Hodsden T.", "AuthorID": "57194680298", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington"}, "56404844900": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "56404844900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington"}, "6701353187": {"Name": "Heeney M.", "AuthorID": "6701353187", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington"}}}
