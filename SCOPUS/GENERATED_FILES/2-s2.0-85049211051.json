Methods Cross-sectional probability sample survey of women and men aged 16-74 years, resident in Britain, interviewed between 2010 and 2012. Analyses reported here were of 4571 women and 3142 men aged 16-44 years who reported having vaginal sex in the past year. Those relying exclusively on sterilisation (including hysterectomy) were excluded. Sources of contraceptive supplies were categorised as: general practice, community clinic, retail and other. Prevalence of use of these sources was estimated, and associated factors examined. Results Some 87.0% of women and 73.8% of men accessed at least one source of contraceptive supplies in the previous year. Most women (59.1%) used general practice and most men (54.6%) used retail outlets. Community clinics were less commonly used, by 23.0% of women and 21.3% of men, but these users were younger and at greater sexual health risk. These associations were also observed among the 27.3% of women and 30.6% of men who used more than one source category (general practice, community clinic or retail) for contraceptive supplies. Conclusions People in Britain use a variety of sources to obtain contraceptive supplies and some sources are more commonly used by those more vulnerable to poorer sexual health. Our findings suggest that national policy changes to increase access to contraceptive methods have had an effect on the diversity of services used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contraceptive service use", "family planning", "natsal-3", "prevalence", "user characteristics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049211051", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7202789278": {"Name": "French R.", "AuthorID": "7202789278", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35370179000": {"Name": "Glasier A.", "AuthorID": "35370179000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "37116738400": {"Name": "Datta J.", "AuthorID": "37116738400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6603485100": {"Name": "MacDowall W.", "AuthorID": "6603485100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55989881900": {"Name": "Palmer M.", "AuthorID": "55989881900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55522384600": {"Name": "Geary R.", "AuthorID": "55522384600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57199313412": {"Name": "Jones K.", "AuthorID": "57199313412", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}}}
