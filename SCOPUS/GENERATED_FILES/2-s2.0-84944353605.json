Building upon a pseudo algebraic blow up (previously introduced by the author) we prove a geometric rate of decay for the mass ratio towards the limiting density, with an explicit exponent of decay expressed in terms of the density of the current at the point. With a non-explicit exponent this result was proved using different techniques by Pumberger and Rivi\u00e8re (Duke Math J 152(3):441\u2013480, 2010).", "AuthorKeywords": ["35J99", "Primary 53C38", "Secondary 49Q20"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944353605", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"50161069400": {"Name": "Bellettini C.", "AuthorID": "50161069400", "AffiliationID": "60003269, 60027485", "AffiliationName": "IAS, Princeton University"}}}
