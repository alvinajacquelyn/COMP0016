This paper explores the role of heritage values, tourism and community perceptions held by destination hosts as drivers to willingness to participate in heritage tourism development. Such enquiry aims to enhance our current knowledge of community views and their potential to influence involvement in participatory decision-making in order to inform policy approaches to collaborative heritage tourism strategies. Using a relatively inexperienced destination community (Kastoria, Greece), the study collects quantitative data via an attitudinal survey. Our findings suggest that intentions to participate are mainly driven by community ideals while their positive influence is more evident on community members with high place attachment. Heritage values play a significant role; however, their effects do not always favour participation as they can also act as barriers to involvement. On the other hand, tourism perceptions are found to be mainly insignificant in shaping intentions to participate. Finally, the paper presents and discusses variations between different demographic groups and draws implications for policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes", "community", "Heritage tourism", "heritage values", "participation", "perceptions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017141879", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"56414884500": {"Name": "Dragouni M.", "AuthorID": "56414884500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage"}, "38961158600": {"Name": "Fouseki K.", "AuthorID": "38961158600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage"}}}
