In order to further improve the current vendor-implemented MR-AC methods for absolute quantification, a number of prototype methods have been proposed in the literature. These can be categorized into three types: template/atlas-based, segmentation-based, and reconstruction-based. These proposed methods in general demonstrated improvements compared to vendor-implemented AC, and many studies report deviations in PET uptake after AC of only a few percent from a gold standard CT-AC. Using a unified quantitative evaluation with identical metrics, subject cohort, and common CT-based reference, the aims of this study were to evaluate a selection of novel methods proposed in the literature, and identify the ones suitable for clinical use. Methods In total, 11 AC methods were evaluated: two vendor-implemented (MR-ACDIXON and MR-ACUTE), five based on template/atlas information (MR-ACSEGBONE (Koesters et al., 2016), MR-ACONTARIO (Anazodo et al., 2014), MR-ACBOSTON (Izquierdo-Garcia et al., 2014), MR-ACUCL (Burgos et al., 2014), and MR-ACMAXPROB (Merida et al., 2015)), one based on simultaneous reconstruction of attenuation and emission (MR-ACMLAA (Benoit et al., 2015)), and three based on image-segmentation (MR-ACMUNICH (Cabello et al., 2015), MR-ACCAR-RiDR (Juttukonda et al., 2015), and MR-ACRESOLUTE (Ladefoged et al., 2015)). We selected 359 subjects who were scanned using one of the following radiotracers: [18F]FDG (210), [11C]PiB (51), and [18F]florbetapir (98). The comparison to AC with a gold standard CT was performed both globally and regionally, with a special focus on robustness and outlier analysis. Results The average performance in PET tracer uptake was within \u00b15% of CT for all of the proposed methods, with the average\u00b1SD global percentage bias in PET FDG uptake for each method being: MR-ACDIXON (\u221211.3\u00b13.5)%, MR-ACUTE (\u22125.7\u00b12.0)%, MR-ACONTARIO (\u22124.3\u00b13.6)%, MR-ACMUNICH (3.7\u00b12.1)%, MR-ACMLAA (\u22121.9\u00b12.6)%, MR-ACSEGBONE (\u22121.7\u00b13.6)%, MR-ACUCL (0.8\u00b11.2)%, MR-ACCAR-RiDR (\u22120.4\u00b11.9)%, MR-ACMAXPROB (\u22120.4\u00b11.6)%, MR-ACBOSTON (\u22120.3\u00b11.8)%, and MR-ACRESOLUTE (0.3\u00b11.7)%, ordered by average bias. The overall best performing methods (MR-ACBOSTON, MR-ACMAXPROB, MR-ACRESOLUTE and MR-ACUCL, ordered alphabetically) showed regional average errors within \u00b13% of PET with CT-AC in all regions of the brain with FDG, and the same four methods, as well as MR-ACCAR-RiDR, showed that for 95% of the patients, 95% of brain voxels had an uptake that deviated by less than 15% from the reference. Comparable performance was obtained with PiB and florbetapir. Conclusions All of the proposed novel methods have an average global performance within likely acceptable limits (\u00b15% of CT-based reference), and the main difference among the methods was found in the robustness, outlier analysis, and clinical feasibility. Overall, the best performing methods were MR-ACBOSTON, MR-ACMAXPROB, MR-ACRESOLUTE and MR-ACUCL, ordered alphabetically. These methods all minimized the number of outliers, standard deviation, and average global and local error. The methods MR-ACMUNICH and MR-ACCAR-RiDR were both within acceptable quantitative limits, so these methods should be considered if processing time is a factor. The method MR-ACSEGBONE also demonstrates promising results, and performs well within the likely acceptable quantitative limits. For clinical routine scans where processing time can be a key factor, this vendor-provided solution currently outperforms most methods. With the performance of the methods presented here, it may be concluded that the challenge of improving the accuracy of MR-AC in adult brains with normal anatomy has been solved to a quantitatively acceptable degree, which is smaller than the quantification reproducibility in PET imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attenuation correction", "Brain", "PET/MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007086820", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55541718700": {"Name": "Ladefoged C.N.", "AuthorID": "55541718700", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "7005327701": {"Name": "Law I.", "AuthorID": "7005327701", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "55334728100": {"Name": "Benoit D.", "AuthorID": "55334728100", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "57212012101": {"Name": "Holm S.", "AuthorID": "57212012101", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "7004744252": {"Name": "H\u00f8jgaard L.", "AuthorID": "7004744252", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "55359150600": {"Name": "Hansen A.E.", "AuthorID": "55359150600", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "7102021076": {"Name": "Andersen F.L.", "AuthorID": "7102021076", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen"}, "55911201800": {"Name": "Anazodo U.", "AuthorID": "55911201800", "AffiliationID": "60026135", "AffiliationName": "Lawson Health Research Institute"}, "35974114800": {"Name": "St. Lawrence K.", "AuthorID": "35974114800", "AffiliationID": "60026135", "AffiliationName": "Lawson Health Research Institute"}, "26030468500": {"Name": "Izquierdo-Garcia D.", "AuthorID": "26030468500", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Athinoula A.
