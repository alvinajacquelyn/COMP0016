Published by FEBS Press and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Transgenic porcine cancer models bring novel possibilities for research. Their physical similarities with humans enable the use of surgical procedures and treatment approaches used for patients, which facilitates clinical translation. Here, we aimed to develop an inducible oncopig model of intestinal cancer. Transgenic (TG) minipigs were generated using somatic cell nuclear transfer by handmade cloning. The pigs encode two TG cassettes: (a) an Flp recombinase-inducible oncogene cassette containing KRAS-G12D, cMYC, SV40LT \u2013 which inhibits p53 \u2013 and pRB and (b) a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible Flp recombinase activator cassette controlled by the intestinal epithelium-specific villin promoter. Thirteen viable transgenic minipigs were born. The ability of 4-OHT to activate the oncogene cassette was confirmed in vitro in TG colonic organoids and ex vivo in tissue biopsies obtained by colonoscopy. In order to provide proof of principle that the oncogene cassette could also successfully be activated in vivo, three pigs were perorally treated with 400 mg tamoxifen for 2 \u00d7 5 days. After two months, one pig developed a duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma with a lymph node metastasis. Molecular analysis of the carcinoma and metastasis confirmed activation of the oncogene cassette. No tumor formation was observed in untreated TG pigs or in the remaining two treated pigs. The latter indicates that tamoxifen delivery can probably be improved. In summary, we have generated a novel inducible oncopig model of intestinal cancer, which has the ability to form metastatic disease already two months after induction. The model may be helpful in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical usage. It opens new venues for longitudinal studies of tumor development and evolution, for preclinical assessment of new anticancer regimens, for pharmacology and toxicology assessments, as well as for studies into biological mechanisms of tumor formation and metastasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["inducible intestinal cancer", "oncopig", "tissue-specific activation", "transgenic porcine model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Cloning, Organism", "Disease Models, Animal", "Embryo Culture Techniques", "Embryo Transfer", "Female", "Humans", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Intestines", "Nuclear Transfer Techniques", "Swine", "Swine, Miniature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031092360", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56431177200": {"Name": "Callesen M.M.", "AuthorID": "56431177200", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "54419377900": {"Name": "\u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir S.S.", "AuthorID": "54419377900", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "57190667163": {"Name": "Lyskj\u00e6r I.", "AuthorID": "57190667163", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "56928440800": {"Name": "\u00d8rntoft M.B.W.", "AuthorID": "56928440800", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "26632592600": {"Name": "Rasmussen M.H.", "AuthorID": "26632592600", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "57203052303": {"Name": "\u00d8rntoft T.F.", "AuthorID": "57203052303", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "7202104407": {"Name": "Andersen C.L.", "AuthorID": "7202104407", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "7101695038": {"Name": "H\u00f8yer S.", "AuthorID": "7101695038", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "26026862800": {"Name": "Dagn\u00e6s-Hansen F.", "AuthorID": "26026862800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "57190984904": {"Name": "Berthelsen M.F.", "AuthorID": "57190984904", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "56973446400": {"Name": "Thomsen M.K.", "AuthorID": "56973446400", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "57196038245": {"Name": "Elverl\u00f8v-Jakobsen J.E.", "AuthorID": "57196038245", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "54383758000": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "54383758000", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science, Aarhus University"}, "57190621270": {"Name": "Li R.", "AuthorID": "57190621270", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science, Aarhus University"}, "7004288766": {"Name": "Callesen H.", "AuthorID": "7004288766", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science, Aarhus University"}, "55881560500": {"Name": "Schweiger P.J.", "AuthorID": "55881560500", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, University of Copenhagen"}, "35744785400": {"Name": "Jensen K.B.", "AuthorID": "35744785400", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005800700": {"Name": "Laurberg S.", "AuthorID": "7005800700", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Department P, Aarhus University Hospital"}}}
