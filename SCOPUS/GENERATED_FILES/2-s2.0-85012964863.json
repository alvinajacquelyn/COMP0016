It is based on regularized least squares with an\u211300(\u21132) penalty, which penalizes the number of nonzero groups. One distinct feature of the approach is that it has the built-in decorrelation mechanism within each group, and thus, can handle challenging strong inner-group correlation. We provide a complete analysis of the regularized model, e.g., existence of a global minimizer, invariance property, support recovery, and properties of block coordinatewise minimizers. Further, the regularized problem admits an efficient primal dual active set algorithm with a provable finite-step global convergence. At each iteration, it involves solving a least-squares problem on the active set only, and exhibits a fast local convergence, which makes the method extremely efficient for recovering group sparse signals. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to illustrate salient features of the model and the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. A comparative study indicates its competitiveness with existing approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["block coordinatewise minimizer", "block sparsity", "blockwise mutual incoherence", "global minimizer", "Group sparsity", "primal dual active set algorithm", "\u211300(\u21132) penalty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active-Set algorithms", "block coordinatewise minimizer", "Block sparsities", "blockwise mutual incoherence", "Global minimizers", "Group sparsities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012964863", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55885381100": {"Name": "Jiao Y.", "AuthorID": "55885381100", "AffiliationID": "60024979", "AffiliationName": "School of Statistics and Mathematics, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "24468723000": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "24468723000", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University and Hubei Key Laboratory of Computational Science, Wuhan University"}}}
