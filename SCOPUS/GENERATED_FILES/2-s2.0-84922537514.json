Objectives: To examine whether the CHD-associated loci are associated with measures of atherosclerosis in data from up to 9582 individuals of European ancestry. Methods: Forty-five SNPs representing the CHD-associated loci were genotyped in middle-aged to elderly individuals of European descent from four independent population-based studies (IMPROVE, MDC-CC, ULSAM and PIVUS). Intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured by external B-mode ultrasonography at the far wall of the bulb (sinus) and common carotid artery. Plaque presence was defined as a maximal IMT of the bulb >1.5mm. We meta-analysed single-SNP associations across the four studies, and combined them in a genetic predisposition score. We subsequently examined the association of the genetic predisposition score with prevalent CHD and the three indices of atherosclerosis, adjusting for sex, age and Framingham risk factors. Results: As anticipated, the genetic predisposition score was associated with prevalent CHD, with each additional risk allele increasing the odds of disease by 5.5% (p=4.1\u00d710-6). Moreover, each additional CHD-risk allele across the 45 loci was associated with a 0.24% increase in IMT (p=4.0\u00d710-3), and with a 2.8% increased odds of plaque presence (p=7.4\u00d710-6) at the far wall of the bulb. The genetic predisposition score was not associated with IMT of the common carotid artery (p=0.47). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the association between the 45 previously identified loci and CHD at least partly acts through atherosclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherogenic plaque", "Atherosclerosis", "Carotid artery", "Genome-wide association", "Intima-media thickness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alleles", "Carotid Artery, Common", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Coronary Disease", "Europe", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922537514", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"25224878400": {"Name": "Den Hoed M.", "AuthorID": "25224878400", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University"}, "55801204900": {"Name": "Gustafsson S.", "AuthorID": "55801204900", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University"}, "6506552509": {"Name": "Ingelsson E.", "AuthorID": "6506552509", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University"}, "20434386200": {"Name": "Strawbridge R.J.", "AuthorID": "20434386200", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna"}, "7101682939": {"Name": "Hamsten A.", "AuthorID": "7101682939", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna"}, "6701896858": {"Name": "Almgren P.", "AuthorID": "6701896858", "AffiliationID": "60118785, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lund University and Lund University Diabetes Centre"}, "7004836666": {"Name": "Engstr\u00f6m G.", "AuthorID": "7004836666", "AffiliationID": "60118785, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lund University and Lund University Diabetes Centre"}, "7006711915": {"Name": "Hedblad B.", "AuthorID": "7006711915", "AffiliationID": "60118785, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lund University and Lund University Diabetes Centre"}, "26426698100": {"Name": "\u00d6stling G.", "AuthorID": "26426698100", "AffiliationID": "60118785, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lund University and Lund University Diabetes Centre"}, "7004120938": {"Name": "Melander O.", "AuthorID": "7004120938", "AffiliationID": "60118785, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lund University and Lund University Diabetes Centre"}, "8104820900": {"Name": "Axelsson T.", "AuthorID": "8104820900", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, SNP and SEQ Technology Platform, Uppsala University"}, "7005911199": {"Name": "Syv\u00e4nen A.C.", "AuthorID": "7005911199", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine, Uppsala University"}, "7103145439": {"Name": "de Faire U.", "AuthorID": "7103145439", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, University College London"}, "7005443464": {"Name": "Lindgren C.M.", "AuthorID": "7005443464", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology Unit, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "7403404824": {"Name": "Morris A.P.", "AuthorID": "7403404824", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Liverpool"}, "7006057885": {"Name": "Tremoli E.", "AuthorID": "7006057885", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche e Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0 di Milano and oCentro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "26643471200": {"Name": "Lind L.", "AuthorID": "26643471200", "AffiliationID": "60015216, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Cardiovascular Epidemiology and EpiHealth, Uppsala University, Akademiska Sjukhuset"}}}
