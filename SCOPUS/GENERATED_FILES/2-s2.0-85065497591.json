However, up until now it has remained unclear whether such influences are exerted at a perceptual or decisional locus, as most previous studies have used response times as their primary dependent measure. Here, we asked whether perceptual sensitivity is also dependent on social cognition. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to evaluate whether low-contrast Gabor patterns embedded in noise were visible from either their own or an avatar\u2019s perspective. Across three experiments, we found that observers\u2019 detection performance was increased if an avatar also shared perception of the stimulus location. By leveraging signal detection modelling, we show that this effect is driven by a change in perceptual sensitivity (d\u2032), independent of decisional or response interference. Furthermore, by \u201cblindfolding\u201d the avatar, we show that the boosting effect of shared perception on detection sensitivity is only obtained when the participant believes the avatar can also see the stimulus, ruling out an influence of low-level directional cues. We interpret these results within a framework in which the avatar\u2019s perspective boosts top-down spatial attention by prioritising particular spatial locations at which perception is shared. In summary, we reveal that perceptual sensitivity is modulated by the perspective of others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Bayesian modeling", "Signal detection theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Cues", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Social Behavior", "Space Perception", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065497591", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57204586863": {"Name": "Seow T.", "AuthorID": "57204586863", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin"}, "35068005100": {"Name": "Fleming S.", "AuthorID": "35068005100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Aging Research, University College London"}}}
