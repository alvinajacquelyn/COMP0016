A theorem of Bollob\u00e1s and Thomason says that every 22k-connected (undirected) graph is k-linked. It is desirable to obtain analogues for directed graphs as well. Although Thomassen showed that the Bollob\u00e1s-Thomason Theorem does not hold for general directed graphs, he proved an analogue of the theorem for tournaments-there is a function f(k) such that every strongly f(k)-connected tournament is k-linked. The bound on f(k) was reduced to O(k log k) by K\u00fchn, Lapinskas, Osthus, and Patel, who also conjectured that a linear bound should hold. We prove this conjecture, by showing that every strongly 452k-connected tournament is k-linked.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Connectivity of tournaments", "Linkage structures", "Linkedness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939251846", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Methods for Discrete Structures, Freie Universit\u00e4t"}}}
