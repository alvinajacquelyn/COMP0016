However, such evidence comes from population studies carried out mainly in the USA.Objectives: To assess the association between tooth loss and loss of cognitive function in older people from Southern Brazil, with particular interest on how age may modify such association. In addition, we also test the association between loss of cognition (exposure) and tooth loss (outcome).Methods: Data from a baseline population-based cohort study were cross-sectionally analyzed, including tooth loss, cognitive impairment, sex, income, educational attainment, color/race, smoking status and a range of self-reported chronic diseases. Participants (n = 1705) were 60 years of age and over, from a midsized Southern Brazilian city. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic and partial ordinal logistic analyses.Results: Edentate status was associated (OR 3.3; 95%CI 1.2-9.3) with severe cognitive impairment in the fully adjusted model. Moreover, there was an interaction between number of teeth and age on severe cognitive impairment. A weak association between severe cognitive impairment (exposure) and tooth loss (outcome) was identified after the adjustment for potential covariates.Conclusions: This study lends support to hypothesized association between tooth loss and severe cognitive impairment. Older adults seem to be particularly vulnerable to such effects. However, the bidirectional association between tooth loss and severe cognitive impairment cannot be ruled out.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "cognition disorders", "cross-sectional studies", "tooth loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Brazil", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dental Health Surveys", "Educational Status", "Female", "Humans", "Income", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oral Health", "Population Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Severity of Illness Index", "Smoking", "Social Class", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Tooth Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937024419", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55930551500": {"Name": "Peres M.A.", "AuthorID": "55930551500", "AffiliationID": "60082338, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health, School of Dentistry, University of Adelaide"}, "12445265000": {"Name": "Bastos J.L.", "AuthorID": "12445265000", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Post-graduate Program in Public Health, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Universit\u00e1rio Trindade"}, "6508367708": {"Name": "Barbato P.R.", "AuthorID": "6508367708", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Post-graduate Program in Public Health, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Universit\u00e1rio Trindade"}, "6506885965": {"Name": "Dorsi E.", "AuthorID": "6506885965", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Post-graduate Program in Public Health, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Universit\u00e1rio Trindade"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8234756400": {"Name": "Xavier A.J.", "AuthorID": "8234756400", "AffiliationID": "107193116", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, South of Santa Catarina University"}}}
