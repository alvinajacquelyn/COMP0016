A single 500 mg dose of doripenem was administered as a 1 hour infusion during HVHDF to 9 patients. Arterial blood samples were collected before and at 30 or 60 minute intervals over 8 hours (12 samples) after study drug administration. Doripenem concentrations were determined by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Population PK analysis and Monte Carlo simulation of 1,000 subjects were performed. The median convective volume of HVHDF was 10.3 L/h and urine output during the sampling period was 70 mL. The population mean total doripenem clearance on HVHDF was 6.82 L/h, volume of distribution of central compartment 10.8 L, and of peripheral compartment 12.1 L. Doses of 500 mg every 8 hours resulted in 88.5% probability of attaining the target of 50% time over MIC for bacteria with MIC = 2 \u03bcg/mL at 48 hours, when doubling of MIC during that time was assumed. Significant elimination of doripenem occurs during HVHDF. Doses of 500 mg every 8 hours are necessary for treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria during extended HVHDF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibiotics", "carbapenems", "dosing", "intensive care", "renal replacement therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Carbapenems", "Female", "Hemodiafiltration", "Humans", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monte Carlo Method", "Shock, Septic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924421962", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6507469317": {"Name": "Tamme K.", "AuthorID": "6507469317", "AffiliationID": "60068891", "AffiliationName": "Tartu University Hospital"}, "55927842100": {"Name": "Metsvaht T.", "AuthorID": "55927842100", "AffiliationID": "60068891", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Tartu University Hospital"}, "23568225600": {"Name": "Karjagin J.", "AuthorID": "23568225600", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Tartu"}, "16175712600": {"Name": "Kern H.", "AuthorID": "16175712600", "AffiliationID": "100350286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, DRK Kliniken, BerlinK\u00f6penick"}, "6603624118": {"Name": "Starkopf J.", "AuthorID": "6603624118", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Tartu"}, "6602856586": {"Name": "Oselin K.", "AuthorID": "6602856586", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Tartu"}, "26867768100": {"Name": "Kipper K.", "AuthorID": "26867768100", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Testing Centre, Institute of Chemistry, University of Tartu"}, "7801500035": {"Name": "Herodes K.", "AuthorID": "7801500035", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Testing Centre, Institute of Chemistry, University of Tartu"}, "56480062100": {"Name": "Low K.", "AuthorID": "56480062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
