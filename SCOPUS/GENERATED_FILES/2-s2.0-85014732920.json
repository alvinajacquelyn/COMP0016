The aim of the deanery-led audit was to assess our regional operative experience using trainee logbooks against indicative number standards and to develop a tool to help guide regional training. Subjects and methods: Annual logbook data were collected using a questionnaire from urology trainees in a single region. Logbook data were excluded for an incomplete entry or work at multiple trusts in the same year. Logbooks were assumed to be current and validated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis. Results: Altogether 24 trainees across 19 different training sites responded to the questionnaire. A total of 9777 indicative procedures were included in the analysis. Median annual operative numbers were lower than required for 10/13 procedures, but mean annual operative numbers were higher than required for only 1/13 procedures (andrology). Significant variation in annual operative numbers across training sites was observed for 6/13 procedures. Annual logbook data was used to rank training sites by procedure-specific volumes and likelihood of trainees to achieve the annual operative target. Conclusion: Trainee logbook data is useful for objective ranking of training sites. In our region, difficulty in surpassing indicative numbers would arise due to significant case number variation between training sites and not due to regional insufficiency in case numbers. Regular analysis of trainee logbooks would allow better management of regional training with respect to indicative numbers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["education", "Indicative numbers", "Joint Committee on Surgical Training guidelines", "surgical logbook", "surgical training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014732920", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57193528321": {"Name": "Yamamoto H.", "AuthorID": "57193528321", "AffiliationID": "60109217", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s Health Partners"}, "57193531979": {"Name": "Webster J.", "AuthorID": "57193531979", "AffiliationID": "60007904", "AffiliationName": "London North West NHS Trust"}, "9238976200": {"Name": "Kavia R.", "AuthorID": "9238976200", "AffiliationID": "60007904", "AffiliationName": "London North West NHS Trust"}, "57202895697": {"Name": "Datta S.N.", "AuthorID": "57202895697", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26667854300": {"Name": "Maan Z.", "AuthorID": "26667854300", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55944633700": {"Name": "Junaid I.", "AuthorID": "55944633700", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Bart\u2019s Health NHS Trust"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
