Numerical analyses utilizing discrete element method were carried out with the use of multiple seismic records selected based on the disaggregation of the seismic hazard for the region of interest. To identify their impact on structural performance, earthquake Intensity Measures, such as Peak Ground Acceleration and Peak Ground Velocity are examined for the case of a column that sustained no visible permanent deformations during the Ms = 6.5 Thessaloniki earthquake of 1978. The analysis revealed a weak correlation of PGA and PGV with the response results and a significant influence of the mean frequency (fm) of the seismic motion. No coupling was found between the maximum displacement of the top during the oscillation and the permanent post-seismic deformations. The complementarity of both earthquake Intensity Measures in the structural vulnerability assessment is also depicted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ancient monuments", "Discrete element method (DEM)", "Free standing column", "Intensity measures", "Rocking", "Seismic vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ancient monuments", "Intensity measure", "Peak ground acceleration", "Permanent deformations", "Rocking", "Seismic vulnerability", "Structural performance", "Structural vulnerability assessments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992316157", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"6506967924": {"Name": "Sextos A.", "AuthorID": "6506967924", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57189095921": {"Name": "Pappas A.", "AuthorID": "57189095921", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Padova"}, "6508252867": {"Name": "da Porto F.", "AuthorID": "6508252867", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Padova"}, "7004600492": {"Name": "Modena C.", "AuthorID": "7004600492", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Padova"}}}
