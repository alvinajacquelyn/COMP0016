This study aimed to determine the effect of age, gender, stage and time on voice-related quality of life using the Voice Handicap Index-10.Methods Primary early glottic carcinoma patients treated with transoral laser microsurgery were included in the study. Self-reported Voice Handicap Index testing was completed pre-operatively, three months post-operatively, and yearly at follow-up appointments.Results Voice Handicap Index improvement was found to be dependent on age and tumour stage, while no significant differences were found in Voice Handicap Index for gender. Voice Handicap Index score was significantly improved at 12 months and 24 months. Time versus Voice Handicap Index modelling revealed a preference for non-linear over linear regression.Conclusion Age and stage are important factors, as younger patients with more advanced tumours show greater voice improvement post-operatively. Patient's Voice Handicap Index is predicted to have 95 per cent of maximal improvement by 5.5 months post-operatively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glottis", "Laryngeal Neoplasms", "Microsurgery", "Quality Of Life", "Voice Quality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Female", "Glottis", "Humans", "Laryngeal Neoplasms", "Laser Therapy", "Male", "Microsurgery", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Self Report", "Treatment Outcome", "Voice Disorders", "Voice Quality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063639035", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57213277747": {"Name": "Lane C.", "AuthorID": "57213277747", "AffiliationID": "60015913, 60000540", "AffiliationName": "Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, VG Site 3rd Floor, Dickson Building"}, "14018384500": {"Name": "Rigby M.", "AuthorID": "14018384500", "AffiliationID": "60015913, 60000540", "AffiliationName": "Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, VG Site 3rd Floor, Dickson Building"}, "35272375300": {"Name": "Hart R.", "AuthorID": "35272375300", "AffiliationID": "60015913, 60000540", "AffiliationName": "Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, VG Site 3rd Floor, Dickson Building"}, "6603208918": {"Name": "Trites J.", "AuthorID": "6603208918", "AffiliationID": "60015913, 60000540", "AffiliationName": "Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, VG Site 3rd Floor, Dickson Building"}, "57213880838": {"Name": "Levi E.", "AuthorID": "57213880838", "AffiliationID": "60015913, 60000540", "AffiliationName": "Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, VG Site 3rd Floor, Dickson Building"}, "57193274340": {"Name": "Taylor S.M.", "AuthorID": "57193274340", "AffiliationID": "60015913, 60000540", "AffiliationName": "Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, VG Site 3rd Floor, Dickson Building"}}}
