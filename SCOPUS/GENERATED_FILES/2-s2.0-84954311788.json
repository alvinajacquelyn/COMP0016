These aggregated forms have been proposed to have differential toxicities and their interaction with mitochondria may cause dysfunction within this organelle that contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, the association of \u03b1-synuclein with mitochondria occurs through interaction with mitochondrial complex I and importantly defects of this protein have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between aggregated \u03b1-synuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction, and the consequences of this interaction on cell survival. To do this, we studied the effects of \u03b1-synuclein on cybrid cell lines harbouring mutations in either mitochondrial complex I or IV. We found that aggregated \u03b1-synuclein inhibited mitochondrial complex I in control and complex IV-deficient cells. However, when aggregated \u03b1-synuclein was applied to complex I-deficient cells, there was no additional inhibition of mitochondrial function or increase in cell death. This would suggest that as complex I-deficient cells have already adapted to their mitochondrial defect, the subsequent toxic effects of \u03b1-synuclein are reduced.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Animals", "Electron Transport Complex I", "Humans", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Mutation", "Neurons", "Oxidative Stress", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954311788", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"13403214400": {"Name": "Reeve A.K.", "AuthorID": "13403214400", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60026712, 60105834", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute for Neuroscience, Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "55772035700": {"Name": "Simcox E.M.", "AuthorID": "55772035700", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60026712, 60105834", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute for Neuroscience, Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "55762540300": {"Name": "Turnbull D.M.", "AuthorID": "55762540300", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60026712, 60105834", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute for Neuroscience, Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "36482996900": {"Name": "Ludtmann M.H.R.", "AuthorID": "36482996900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56081167500": {"Name": "Angelova P.R.", "AuthorID": "56081167500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "9739583500": {"Name": "Gandhi S.", "AuthorID": "9739583500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "54882520800": {"Name": "Horrocks M.H.", "AuthorID": "54882520800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
