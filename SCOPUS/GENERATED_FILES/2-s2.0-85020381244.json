As with gratingor analyzer-based methods, conventional image reconstruction methods for EIXPCT require that two or more images be acquired at each tomographic view angle. This requirement leads to increased data acquisition times, hindering in vivo applications. To circumvent these limitations, a joint reconstruction (JR) approach is proposed that concurrently produces estimates of the refractive index and absorption distributions from a tomographic data set containing only a single image per tomographic view angle. The JR reconstruction method solves a nonlinear optimization problem by use of a novel iterative gradient-based algorithm. The JR method is demonstrated in both computer-simulated and experimental EIXPCT studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Joint reconstruction", "Phase-contrast imaging", "Single-shot imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption distribution", "Image reconstruction methods", "Iterative gradient-based algorithms", "Non-linear optimization problems", "Phase-contrast imaging", "Reconstruction method", "Single-shot imaging", "X-ray phase-contrast tomography"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020381244", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57190290022": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57190290022", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "56184326400": {"Name": "Guan H.", "AuthorID": "56184326400", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "7006769220": {"Name": "Anastasio M.", "AuthorID": "7006769220", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
