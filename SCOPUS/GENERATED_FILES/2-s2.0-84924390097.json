Immunology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Summary: Antigen-specific multifunctional T cells that secrete interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 simultaneously after activation are important for the control of many infections. It is unclear if these CD8+ T cells are at an early or late stage of differentiation and whether telomere erosion restricts their replicative capacity. We developed a multi-parameter flow cytometric method for investigating the relationship between differentiation (CD45RA and CD27 surface phenotype), function (cytokine production) and replicative capacity (telomere length) in individual cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. This involves surface and intracellular cell staining coupled to fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect telomeres (flow-FISH). The end-stage/senescent CD8+ CD45RA+ CD27- T-cell subset increases significantly during ageing and this is exaggerated in CMV immune-responsive subjects. However, these end-stage cells do not have the shortest telomeres, implicating additional non-telomere-related mechanisms in inducing their senescence. The telomere lengths in total and CMV (NLV)-specific CD8+ T cells in all four subsets defined by CD45RA and CD27 expression were significantly shorter in old compared with young individuals in both a Caucasian and an Asian cohort. Following stimulation by anti-CD3 or NLV peptide, similar proportions of triple-cytokine-producing cells are found in CD8+ T cells at all stages of differentiation in both age groups. Furthermore, these multi-functional cells had intermediate telomere lengths compared with cells producing only one or two cytokines after activation. Therefore, global and CMV (NLV)-specific CD8+ T cells that secrete interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 are at an intermediate stage of differentiation and are not restricted by excessive telomere erosion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD8+ T cells", "Cytomegalovirus", "Multi-functional", "Senescence", "Telomere"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Antigens, CD27", "Antigens, CD45", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Biomarkers", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Aging", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytokines", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "London", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Phenotype", "Singapore", "Telomere", "Telomere Shortening", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924390097", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"26423855300": {"Name": "Riddell N.", "AuthorID": "26423855300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57197393556": {"Name": "Griffiths S.", "AuthorID": "57197393556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7005668027": {"Name": "Henson S.", "AuthorID": "7005668027", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "23467582000": {"Name": "Rivino L.", "AuthorID": "23467582000", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore"}, "56542337300": {"Name": "King D.", "AuthorID": "56542337300", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore"}, "55617348600": {"Name": "Teo G.", "AuthorID": "55617348600", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore"}, "35452499200": {"Name": "Kemeny D.", "AuthorID": "35452499200", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore"}, "6603589465": {"Name": "Macary P.", "AuthorID": "6603589465", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore"}, "6506885517": {"Name": "Cantisan S.", "AuthorID": "6506885517", "AffiliationID": "60003138, 60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Hospital Reina Sofia, University of Cordoba"}, "56001920700": {"Name": "Solana R.", "AuthorID": "56001920700", "AffiliationID": "60003138, 60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Hospital Reina Sofia, University of Cordoba"}, "8051106900": {"Name": "Larbi A.", "AuthorID": "8051106900", "AffiliationID": "60113370, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Immunology Network, A STAR"}}}
