However, until recently, relatively little attention has been paid to the extent to which the structure of experimental environments relates to natural scenarios, and the survival problems that individuals have evolved to solve. This situation not only risks leaving decision-theoretic accounts ungrounded but also makes various aspects of the solutions, such as hard-wired or Pavlovian policies, difficult to interpret in the natural world. Here, we suggest importing concepts, paradigms and approaches from the fields of ethology and behavioural ecology, which concentrate on the contextual and functional correlates of decisions made about foraging and escape and address these lacunae.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Decision Making", "Environment", "Ethology", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Research", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Neurosciences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042669983", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6701470126": {"Name": "Mobbs D.", "AuthorID": "6701470126", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences and Computation and Neural Systems Program, California Institute of Technology"}, "24778818500": {"Name": "Trimmer P.C.", "AuthorID": "24778818500", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California"}, "7005561652": {"Name": "Blumstein D.T.", "AuthorID": "7005561652", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
