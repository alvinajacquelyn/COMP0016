Methods: Prospective cohort of all singleton births in England in 2006 at 22-26 weeks of gestation where the fetus was alive at the start of labour monitoring or decision to perform caesarean section. Odds ratios adjusted for potential confounders (aOR) were calculated using logistic regression. Results: One thousand seven hundred twenty two singleton pregnancies were included. 1231 women received antenatal steroids, 437 tocolysis and 356 delivered by Caesarean section. In babies born vaginally, aOR between a partial course of steroids and improved condition at birth was 1.84, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.82 and, for a complete course, 1.63, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.47; for DR death, aORs were 0.34 (0.21 to 0.55) and 0.41 (0.26 to 0.64) for partial and complete courses of steroids. No association was seen for steroid use in babies delivered by Caesarean section. Tocolysis was associated with improved condition at birth (aOR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.0) and lower odds of death (aOR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.73). In women without spontaneous labour, Caesarean delivery at \u226424 and 25 weeks was associated with improved condition at birth ((aORs 12.67 (2.79 to 57.60) and 4.94 (1.44 to 16.90), respectively) and lower odds of DR death (aORs 0.03 (0.01 to 0.21) and 0.13 (0.03 to 0.55)). There were no differences at 26 weeks gestation or in women with spontaneous labour. Conclusions: Antenatal steroids are strongly associated with improved outcomes in babies born vaginally. Tocolysis was associated with improvements in all analyses. Effects persisted after adjustment for perinatal decision-making. However, associations between delivery mode and birth outcomes may be attributable to case selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antenatal steroids", "Caesarean section", "Extreme prematurity", "Tocolysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cesarean Section", "Clinical Decision-Making", "England", "Female", "Fetal Distress", "Gestational Age", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Labor, Obstetric", "Male", "Perinatal Care", "Pregnancy", "Premature Birth", "Steroids", "Tocolytic Agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003561725", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"36653065400": {"Name": "Morgan A.S.", "AuthorID": "36653065400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute for Womens' Health"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute for Womens' Health"}, "7003504305": {"Name": "Costeloe K.", "AuthorID": "7003504305", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton Hospital"}, "20733798900": {"Name": "Draper E.S.", "AuthorID": "20733798900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "26643018800": {"Name": "Alfirevi\u0107 Z.", "AuthorID": "26643018800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Institute of Translational Medicine"}, "57211565441": {"Name": "Hennessy E.M.", "AuthorID": "57211565441", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, The Wolfson Institute"}}}
