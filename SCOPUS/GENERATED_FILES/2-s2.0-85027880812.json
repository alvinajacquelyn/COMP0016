However, these have been based on the genetic analysis of clinical case\u2013control series. Here, we apply the same analytic approaches to a pathological case\u2013control series and show a predictive AUC of 84%. We suggest that this analysis has clinical utility and that there is limited room for further improvement using genetic data.
