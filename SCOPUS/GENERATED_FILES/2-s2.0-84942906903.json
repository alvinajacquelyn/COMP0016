Safe exposure limits should be maintained, and protective housing and padding are generally needed; however, these impose compromises on the power-transfer-system design. This paper analyses these trade-offs and proposes a design route to achieving high power transfer in the presence of field restrictions and separations for padding or housing materials. An IPT system using a Class D coil-driver and switched-mode power-conditioning is designed to provide regulated d.c. and energy storage. Compliance with ICNIRP 1998 guidelines is demonstrated, at a power level that is sufficient to power typical on-body medical sensing devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["healthcare", "inductive power", "on-body sensing", "wireless power transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exposure guidelines", "inductive power", "Inductive power transfer", "Inductive powertransfer (IPT)", "On-body", "Power conditioning", "Power transfer systems", "Wireless power transfer"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942906903", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"22333508100": {"Name": "Clare L.", "AuthorID": "22333508100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "56158143300": {"Name": "Worgan P.", "AuthorID": "56158143300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "56210431700": {"Name": "Stark B.", "AuthorID": "56210431700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "50861002100": {"Name": "Adami S.", "AuthorID": "50861002100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "55400043700": {"Name": "Coyle D.", "AuthorID": "55400043700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}}}
