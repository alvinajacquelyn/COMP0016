To improve the image quality, prior information derived from anatomical images of the same subject has been previously used in the penalised maximum likelihood (PML) method to regularise the model complexity and selectively smooth the image on a voxel basis in PET reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel perspective of incorporating the prior information by exploring the sparse property of natural images. Instead of a regular voxel grid, the sparse image representation jointly determined by the prior image and the PET data is used in reconstruction to leverage between the image details and smoothness, and this prior is integrated into the PET forward model and has a closed-form expectation maximisation (EM) solution. Simulations show that the proposed approach achieves improved bias versus variance trade-off and higher contrast recovery than the current state-of-the-art methods, and preserves the image details better. Application to clinical PET data shows promising results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EM", "Image prior", "Image reconstruction", "PET", "Supervoxels"], "IndexKeywords": ["Expectation-maximisation", "ILL-posed inverse problem", "Image priors", "PET reconstruction", "Positron emission tomography (PET)", "Sparse image representations", "State-of-the-art methods", "Supervoxels", "Algorithms", "Brain", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Likelihood Functions", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Subtraction Technique"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983643618", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55211821500": {"Name": "Jiao J.", "AuthorID": "55211821500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "8699700500": {"Name": "Markiewicz P.", "AuthorID": "8699700500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "55887379000": {"Name": "Burgos N.", "AuthorID": "55887379000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7005479075": {"Name": "Hutton B.", "AuthorID": "7005479075", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
