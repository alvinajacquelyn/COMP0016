We explored whether prognosis is different in those with epilepsy (>2 unprovoked seizures) and those with a single seizure at presentation. Methods: This is a prospective observational cohort study of people with newly diagnosed seizures. We investigated seizure outcome and survival in people presenting with a single seizure and in those presenting with >2 seizures (epilepsy). Results: 695 people (median follow-up 23.6 years) had unprovoked epileptic seizures. For seizure analysis we excluded 38 people with missing data leaving 657 (309 male, and 249 aged <18 years). Seizures recurred in 67%. The 354 people with epilepsy were only slightly more likely to have further seizure recurrence than the 302 people with a single seizure at presentation (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.59). In 327 people with complete follow-up, 268 (82%, 95% CI 77% to 86%) were in terminal remission; (80%, (95% CI 73% to 85%) in those with epilepsy at presentation). Premature mortality was increased in people with epilepsy (standardised mortality ratio 1.67; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.99) and those with a single seizure at presentation (standardised mortality ratio 2.65; 95% CI 2.23 to 3.15). It is also high in those with early remission. Conclusions: People with epilepsy and with single seizures at presentation in the community generally have good prognosis for seizure control with prolonged follow-up. The risk of premature mortality is significantly increased in both groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EPILEPSY"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Seizures", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957922439", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402206243": {"Name": "Bell G.S.", "AuthorID": "7402206243", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society"}, "55210861700": {"Name": "Giavasi C.", "AuthorID": "55210861700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, NIHR, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "18437280500": {"Name": "Keezer M.R.", "AuthorID": "18437280500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, NIHR, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7101797716": {"Name": "Shorvon S.D.", "AuthorID": "7101797716", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, NIHR, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "23670784300": {"Name": "Neligan A.", "AuthorID": "23670784300", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Homerton University Hospital"}, "23490044700": {"Name": "Novy J.", "AuthorID": "23490044700", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), University of Lausanne"}, "35548124700": {"Name": "Peacock J.L.", "AuthorID": "35548124700", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "7410016800": {"Name": "Johnson A.L.", "AuthorID": "7410016800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "7004238599": {"Name": "Goodridge D.M.G.", "AuthorID": "7004238599", "AffiliationID": "101558366", "AffiliationName": "Warders Medical Centre"}}}
