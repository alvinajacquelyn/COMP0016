The total electron (+positron) fluence in small water and air cavities in a water phantom has been computed for a full linac beam model as well as for a point source spectrum for 6 MV and 15 MV qualities for field sizes from 0.25 \u00d70.25 cm2 to 10 \u00d710 cm2. A water-to-air perturbation factor has been derived as the ratio of total electron (+positron) fluence, integrated over all energies, in a tiny water volume to that in a 'PinPoint 3D-chamber-like' air cavity; for the 0.25 \u00d70.25 cm2 field size the perturbation factors are 1.323 and 2.139 for 6 MV and 15 MV full linac geometries respectively. For the 15 MV full linac geometry for field sizes of 1 \u00d71 cm2 and smaller not only the absolute magnitude but also the 'shape' of the total electron fluence spectrum in the air cavity is significantly different to that in the water 'cavity'. The physics of this 'Bragg-Gray breakdown' is fully explained, making reference to the Fano theorem. For the 15 MV full linac geometry in the 0.25 \u00d70.25 cm2 field the directly computed MC dose ratio, water-to-air, differs by 5% from the product of the Spencer-Attix stopping-power ratio (SPR) and the perturbation factor; this 'difference' is explained by the difference in the shapes of the fluence spectra and is also formulated theoretically. We show that the dimensions of an air-cavity with a perturbation factor within 5% of unity would have to be impractically small in these highly non-equilibrium photon fields. In contrast the dose to water in a 0.25 \u00d70.25 cm2 field derived by multiplying the dose in the single-crystal diamond dosimeter (SCDDo) by the Spencer-Attix ratio is within 2.9% of the dose computed directly in the water voxel for full linac geometry at both 6 and 15 MV, thereby demonstrating that this detector exhibits quasi Bragg-Gray behaviour over a wide range of field sizes and beam qualities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BraggGray breakdown", "electron fluence perturbation", "Monte Carlo", "non-equilibrium photon fields", "PinPoint and SCDDo detectors"], "IndexKeywords": ["BraggGray breakdown", "EGSnrc Monte Carlo", "Electron fluences", "Large deviations", "Megavoltage photons", "Non equilibrium", "Photon fields", "Single crystal diamond", "Electrons", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Particle Accelerators", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Photons", "Radiometry", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946097960", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57213855922": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57213855922", "AffiliationID": "60079949", "AffiliationName": "Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex"}, "7101982549": {"Name": "Nahum A.E.", "AuthorID": "7101982549", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "25921061900": {"Name": "Deshpande D.D.", "AuthorID": "25921061900", "AffiliationID": "60018517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Tata Memorial Hospital"}, "35766390500": {"Name": "Fenwick J.D.", "AuthorID": "35766390500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Gray Institute of Radiation Oncology and Biology, University of Oxford"}, "55823475800": {"Name": "Underwood T.S.A.", "AuthorID": "55823475800", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics Research, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "56322133300": {"Name": "Scott A.J.D.", "AuthorID": "56322133300", "AffiliationID": "60025898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}}}
