In this study we investigated whether physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with self-rated health among adolescents aged 16 years. Methods: The study sample comprised 7,063 adolescents from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC 1986) who responded to a postal questionnaire in 2001 to 2002. Self-rated health was measured by a single-item question, while physical activity was evaluated by a set of questions concerning the intensity and volume of physical activity outside school hours. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with a submaximal cycle ergometer test. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for good self-rated health were obtained from multinomial logistic regression. Results: High levels of physical activity (boys: OR 5.50, 95% CI 3.16 to 9.58; girls: OR 4.25, 95% CI 2.37 to 7.61) and cardiorespiratory fitness (boys: OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.24; girls: OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.66) were associated with very good self-rated health in adolescents. Conclusions: High levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are positively associated with adolescents' self-rated health. Public health promotion activities that foster physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may benefit young people's overall health and well-being.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exercise", "Well-being", "Youth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Female", "Finland", "Health Status", "Heart", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Odds Ratio", "Physical Exertion", "Physical Fitness", "Questionnaires", "Respiration", "Self Concept"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922484982", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"16245052600": {"Name": "Kantomaa M.", "AuthorID": "16245052600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College London"}, "55796811900": {"Name": "Tammelin T.", "AuthorID": "55796811900", "AffiliationID": "60101791", "AffiliationName": "LIKES-Research Center for Sport and Health Sciences"}, "7004978803": {"Name": "Ebeling H.", "AuthorID": "7004978803", "AffiliationID": "60016622", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Child Psychiatry, Oulu University Hospital"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Dept of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6701780093": {"Name": "Taanila A.", "AuthorID": "6701780093", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Sciences, University of Oulu"}}}
