Methodol.", "Volume": "19", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1186/s12874-019-0729-5", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065316567&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: This study examined the agreement between patient-reported chronic diseases and hospital administrative records in hip or knee arthroplasty patients in England. Methods: Survey data reported by 676,428 patients for the English Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) programme was linked to hospital administrative data. Sensitivity and specificity of 11 patient-reported chronic diseases were estimated with hospital administrative data as reference standard. Results: Specificity was high (> 90%) for all 11 chronic diseases. However, sensitivity varied by disease with the highest found for 'diabetes' (87.5%) and 'high blood pressure' (74.3%) and lowest for 'kidney disease' (18.8%) and 'leg pain due to poor circulation' (26.1%). Sensitivity was increased for diseases that were given as specific examples in the questionnaire (e.g. 'parkinson's disease' (65.6%) and 'multiple sclerosis' (69.5%), compared to 'diseases of the nervous system' (20.9%)). Conclusions: Patients can give information about the presence of chronic diseases that is consistent with chronic diseases derived from hospital administrative data if the description in the patient questionnaire is precise and if the disease is familiar to most patients and has significant impact on their life. Such patient questionnaires need to be validated before they are used for research and service evaluation projects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Administrative data", "Chronic diseases", "Hip arthroplasty", "Knee arthroplasty", "Patient-report"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Chronic Disease", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medical Record Administrators", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065316567", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57202951017": {"Name": "Podmore B.", "AuthorID": "57202951017", "AffiliationID": "60008659, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surgeons of England"}, "7006608987": {"Name": "Hutchings A.", "AuthorID": "7006608987", "AffiliationID": "60008659, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surgeons of England"}, "7102799145": {"Name": "Van Der Meulen J.", "AuthorID": "7102799145", "AffiliationID": "60008659, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surgeons of England"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
