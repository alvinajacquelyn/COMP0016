Current approaches however, ignore the fact that the human visual system compensates for geometric transformations, e. g., we see that an image and a rotated copy are identical. Instead, they will report a large, false-positive difference. At the same time, if the transformations become too strong or too spatially incoherent, comparing two images indeed gets increasingly difficult. Between these two extrema, we propose a system to quantify the effect of transformations, not only on the perception of image differences, but also on saliency. To this end, we first fit local homographies to a given optical flow field and then convert this field into a field of elementary transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective. We conduct a perceptual experiment quantifying the increase of difficulty when compensating for elementary transformations. Transformation entropy is proposed as a novel measure of complexity in a flow field. This representation is then used for applications, such as comparison of non-aligned images, where transformations cause threshold elevation, and detection of salient transformations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Homography", "Image metric", "Motion", "Optical flow", "Saliency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Elementary transformation", "Geometric transformations", "Homographies", "Human visual perception", "Human Visual System", "Image metrics", "Motion", "Saliency"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928487465", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55250016000": {"Name": "Kellnhofer P.", "AuthorID": "55250016000", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik"}, "24537726600": {"Name": "Ritschel T.", "AuthorID": "24537726600", "AffiliationID": "60033241", "AffiliationName": "Saarland University"}, "55888212000": {"Name": "Myszkowski K.", "AuthorID": "55888212000", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik"}, "7202927645": {"Name": "Seidel H.", "AuthorID": "7202927645", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik"}}}
