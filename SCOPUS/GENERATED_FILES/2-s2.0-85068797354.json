Aging Cell published by the Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.CpG-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (CGS) have the potential to perturb DNA methylation; however, their effects on Alzheimer disease (AD) risk have not been evaluated systematically. We conducted a genome-wide association study using a sliding-window approach to measure the combined effects of CGSes on AD risk in a discovery sample of 24 European ancestry cohorts (12,181 cases, 12,601 controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and replication sample of seven European ancestry cohorts (7,554 cases, 27,382 controls) from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). The potential functional relevance of significant associations was evaluated by analysis of methylation and expression levels in brain tissue of the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), and in whole blood of Framingham Heart Study participants (FHS). Genome-wide significant (p < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128) associations were identified with 171 1.0 kb-length windows spanning 932 kb in the APOE region (top p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u2212308), five windows at BIN1 (top p = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221213), two windows at MS4A6A (top p = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221210), two windows near MS4A4A (top p = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u221210), and one window at PICALM (p = 6.3 \u00d7 10-9). The total number of CGS-derived CpG dinucleotides in the window near MS4A4A was associated with AD risk (p = 2.67 \u00d7 10\u221210), brain DNA methylation (p = 2.15 \u00d7 10\u221210), and gene expression in brain (p = 0.03) and blood (p = 2.53 \u00d7 10\u22124). Pathway analysis of the genes responsive to changes in the methylation quantitative trait locus signal at MS4A4A (cg14750746) showed an enrichment of methyltransferase functions. We confirm the importance of CGS in AD and the potential for creating a functional CpG dosage-derived genetic score to predict AD risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "DNA methylation", "epigenetics", "eQTL", "genetics", "mQTL"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Cohort Studies", "CpG Islands", "Dinucleoside Phosphates", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Prognosis", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Risk"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068797354", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55616167000": {"Name": "Ma Y.", "AuthorID": "55616167000", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Center, Division of Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "57207904142": {"Name": "Jun G.R.", "AuthorID": "57207904142", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "55470448500": {"Name": "Chung J.", "AuthorID": "55470448500", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine (Biomedical Genetics), Boston University School of Medicine"}, "57205479364": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57205479364", "AffiliationID": "60018701", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health"}, "7005139839": {"Name": "Farrer L.A.", "AuthorID": "7005139839", "AffiliationID": "60018701", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health"}, "56463723000": {"Name": "De Jager P.L.", "AuthorID": "56463723000", "AffiliationID": "60001001", "AffiliationName": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute"}, "57212853504": {"Name": "Lunetta K.L.", "AuthorID": "57212853504", "AffiliationID": "60018701", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health"}, "57211450949": {"Name": "Kunkle B.W.", "AuthorID": "57211450949", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60029251", "AffiliationName": "John P.
