In this work, we address the problem of assigning objects to their storage locations inside a warehouse which has a great impact on the quality of operations within a warehouse. Existing storage policies aim to improve the efficiency by minimizing travel time or by classifying the items based on some features. We go beyond existing methods as we analyze warehouse layout network in an attempt to understand the factors that affect traffic within the warehouse. We use simulated annealing based sampling to assign items to their storage locations while reducing traffic congestion and enhancing the speed of order picking processes. The proposed method enables a range of applications including efficient storage assignment, warehouse reliability evaluation and traffic congestion estimation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Congestion estimation", "Evaluation and analysis", "Modeling process", "Reliability Evaluation", "Storage assignment", "Storage location", "Storage policies", "Warehouse layout"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952815232", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55667881700": {"Name": "Alhalawani S.", "AuthorID": "55667881700", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology - KAUST"}, "7103161991": {"Name": "Mitra N.J.", "AuthorID": "7103161991", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London - UCL"}}}
