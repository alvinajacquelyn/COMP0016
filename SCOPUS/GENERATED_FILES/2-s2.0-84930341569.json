The host factors that affect immunodominance are incompletely understood. Whether immunodominant epitopes elicit protective CD8+ T cell responses or instead act as decoys to subvert immunity and allow pathogens to establish chronic infection is unknown. Here we show that anatomically distinct human granulomas contain clonally expanded CD8+ T cells with overlapping T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. Similarly, the murine CD8+ T cell response against M. tuberculosis is dominated by TB10.44-11-specific T cells with extreme TCR\u03b2 bias. Using a retrogenic model of TB10.44-11-specific CD8+ T cells, we show that TCR dominance can arise because of competition between clonotypes driven by differences in affinity. Finally, we demonstrate that TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells mediate protection against tuberculosis, which requires interferon-\u03b3 production and TAP1-dependent antigen presentation in vivo. Our study of how immunodominance, biased TCR repertoires, and protection are inter-related, provides a new way to measure the quality of T cell immunity, which if applied to vaccine evaluation, could enhance our understanding of how to elicit protective T cell immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Humans", "Immunodominant Epitopes", "Interferon-gamma", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis Vaccines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930341569", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"34870260900": {"Name": "Nunes-Alves C.", "AuthorID": "34870260900", "AffiliationID": "60020475", "AffiliationName": "ICVS/3B\u2019s\u2014PT Government Associate Laboratory"}, "20733622900": {"Name": "Booty M.G.", "AuthorID": "20733622900", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Program in Immunology, Harvard Medical School"}, "36189289400": {"Name": "Carpenter S.M.", "AuthorID": "36189289400", "AffiliationID": "60000986", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School"}, "24722932100": {"Name": "Rothchild A.C.", "AuthorID": "24722932100", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Program in Immunology, Harvard Medical School"}, "56667699400": {"Name": "Steblenko K.", "AuthorID": "56667699400", "AffiliationID": "60000986", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems, University of Massachusetts Medical School"}, "7102533139": {"Name": "Behar S.M.", "AuthorID": "7102533139", "AffiliationID": "60000986", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems, University of Massachusetts Medical School"}, "6508241001": {"Name": "Correia-Neves M.", "AuthorID": "6508241001", "AffiliationID": "60020475", "AffiliationName": "ICVS/3B\u2019s\u2014PT Government Associate Laboratory"}, "35995386600": {"Name": "Desjardins D.", "AuthorID": "35995386600", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital"}, "37108162900": {"Name": "Martin C.J.", "AuthorID": "37108162900", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.
