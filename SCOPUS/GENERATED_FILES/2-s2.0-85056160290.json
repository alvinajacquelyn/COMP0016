Using artificial intelligence, it has become possible to extract meaningful information from large volumes of data, in a shorter frame of time, with very less human interference. In effect, convolutional neural networks (a deep learning method) have been taught to recognize pathological lesions from images. Diabetes has high morbidity, with millions of people who need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Deep neural networks offer a great advantage of screening for DR from retinal images, in improved identification of DR lesions and risk factors for diseases, with high accuracy and reliability. This review aims to compare the current evidences on various deep learning models for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Deep Learning", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Neural Networks (Computer)", "Photography", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056160290", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"10044575200": {"Name": "Raman R.", "AuthorID": "10044575200", "AffiliationID": "60025134", "AffiliationName": "Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Sankara Nethralaya"}, "16246049700": {"Name": "Rao C.", "AuthorID": "16246049700", "AffiliationID": "60025134", "AffiliationName": "Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Sankara Nethralaya"}, "56059320400": {"Name": "Srinivasan S.", "AuthorID": "56059320400", "AffiliationID": "60022754", "AffiliationName": "Vision Research Foundation"}, "57204565220": {"Name": "Virmani S.", "AuthorID": "57204565220", "AffiliationID": "60116922", "AffiliationName": "Verily Life Sciences LLC"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56370604500": {"Name": "Rajalakshmi R.", "AuthorID": "56370604500", "AffiliationID": "60000055", "AffiliationName": "Dr. Mohan\u2019s Diabetes Specialities Centre and Madras Diabetes Research Foundation"}}}
