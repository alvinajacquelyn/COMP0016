In a mechanistic proof-of-concept intervention over 3 months, we investigated whether healthy older adults (60-77 years) also show such plasticity. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and volume (rCBV) were measured with gadolinium-based perfusion imaging (3 Tesla magnetic resonance image (MRI)). Hippocampal volumes were assessed by high-resolution 7 Tesla MRI. Fitness improvement correlated with changes in hippocampal perfusion and hippocampal head volume. Perfusion tended to increase in younger, but to decrease in older individuals. The changes in fitness, hippocampal perfusion and volume were positively related to changes in recognition memory and early recall for complex spatial objects. Path analyses indicated that fitness-related changes in complex object recognition were modulated by hippocampal perfusion. These findings indicate a preserved capacity of the aging human hippocampus for functionally relevant vascular plasticity, which decreases with progressing age.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Analysis of Variance", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cognition", "Exercise", "Female", "Gadolinium", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Oxygen Consumption", "Statistics as Topic", "Verbal Learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929134723", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56425646600": {"Name": "Maass A.", "AuthorID": "56425646600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "40261431700": {"Name": "Goerke M.", "AuthorID": "40261431700", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "56134251100": {"Name": "Becke A.", "AuthorID": "56134251100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "56426457900": {"Name": "Sobieray U.", "AuthorID": "56426457900", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "56425231200": {"Name": "Neumann K.", "AuthorID": "56425231200", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "7103232231": {"Name": "Heinze H.", "AuthorID": "7103232231", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}, "7402141031": {"Name": "M\u00fcller N.", "AuthorID": "7402141031", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "23004411400": {"Name": "D\u00fczel S.", "AuthorID": "23004411400", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "6602648141": {"Name": "L\u00f6vden M.", "AuthorID": "6602648141", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}, "7003644686": {"Name": "Lindenberger U.", "AuthorID": "7003644686", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "7102174121": {"Name": "B\u00e4ckman L.", "AuthorID": "7102174121", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}, "6603940463": {"Name": "Braun-Dullaeus R.", "AuthorID": "6603940463", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "56425814800": {"Name": "Ahrens D.", "AuthorID": "56425814800", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty, Otto-von-Guericke University"}}}
