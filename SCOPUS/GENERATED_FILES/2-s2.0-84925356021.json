ADAMTS13 function is dependent upon multiple exosites that specifically bind the unraveled VWF A2 domain and enable proteolysis. We carried out a comprehensive functional analysis of the ADAMTS13 cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) domain using engineered glycans,sequence swaps, andsingle point mutations in this domain. Mutagenesis of Cys-rich domain-charged residues had no major effect on ADAMTS13 function, and 5 out of 6 engineered glycans on the Cys-rich domain also had no effect on ADAMTS13 function. However, a glycan attached at position 476 appreciably reduced both VWF binding and proteolysis. Substitution of Cys-rich sequences for the corresponding regions in ADAMTS1 identified a hydrophobic pocket involving residues Gly471-Val474 as being of critical importance for both VWF binding and proteolysis. Substitution of hydrophobic VWF A2 domain residues to serine in a region (residues 1642-1659) previously postulated to interact with the Cys-rich domain revealed the functional importance of VWF residues Ile1642, Trp1644, Ile1649, Leu1650, and Ile1651. Furthermore, the functional deficit of the ADAMTS13 Cys-rich Gly471-Val474 variant was dependent on these same hydrophobic VWF residues, suggesting that these regions form complementary binding sites that directly interact to enhance the efficiency of the proteolytic reaction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["ADAM Proteins", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Cysteine", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutagenesis", "Point Mutation", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Recombinant Proteins", "Substrate Specificity", "von Willebrand Factor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925356021", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"26031982600": {"Name": "De Groot R.", "AuthorID": "26031982600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "7403211499": {"Name": "Lane D.", "AuthorID": "7403211499", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "8933730200": {"Name": "Crawley J.", "AuthorID": "8933730200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}}}
