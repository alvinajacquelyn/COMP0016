We conducted 36 in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions with married men and women in Zimbabwe in 2008. Our aim was to identify barriers faced by married women when negotiating for safer sex. Participants identified individual, relational and community-level barriers. Individual level barriers made women voiceless to negotiate for safer sex. Being voiceless emanated from lack sexual decision-making power, economic dependence, low self-efficacy or fear of actual or perceived consequences of negotiating for safer sex. Relational barriers included trust and self-disclosure. At the community level, extended family members and religious leaders were said to explicitly or implicitly discourage women's safer sex negotiation. Given the complexity and multi-levelled nature of barriers affecting sexual behaviour in marriage, our findings suggest that HIV prevention interventions targeted at married women would benefit from empowering individual women, couples and also addressing the wider community.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Condoms", "Female", "Focus Groups", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Marriage", "Middle Aged", "Negotiating", "Power (Psychology)", "Qualitative Research", "Safe Sex", "Sexual Behavior", "Young Adult", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930470049", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55339570800": {"Name": "Mugweni E.", "AuthorID": "55339570800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "12778639500": {"Name": "Pearson S.", "AuthorID": "12778639500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7102131257": {"Name": "Omar M.", "AuthorID": "7102131257", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Centre for International Health and Development, University of Leeds"}}}
