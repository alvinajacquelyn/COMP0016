The amendments are extensive, affecting almost every Article of the pre-existing legislation and introducing important additions. This note discusses the main changes, divided into four broad categories: 'purely' procedural requirements, screening, quality and monitoring. The intention is to highlight the potential benefits of the revision, as well as to indicate some remaining gaps and shortcomings. Although not revolutionary, the 2014 amendments constitute an important stage in the development of the EU EIA regime, in particular due to the more prominent role accorded to legal obligations in shaping the EIA process. The Directive is now a more detailed, structured and sophisticated legal instrument, which has the potential to deliver better environmental decision-making by encouraging deeper engagement with environmental issues by developers and competent authorities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970005306", "SubjectAreas": [["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"56829408700": {"Name": "Arabadjieva K.", "AuthorID": "56829408700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}}}
