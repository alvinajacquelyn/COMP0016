Space division multiplexing (SDM) using multicore fibers (MCFs), multielement fibers, multimode fibers, and their combination; few-mode MCFs; or fibers based on orbital angular momentum are considered to be the propitious stepping-stones to overcome the capacity crunch of conventional single-core fibers. We critically review research progress on SDM fibers and network components, and we introduce two figures of merit aiming for quantitative evaluation of technologies such as amplifiers, fan-in/fan-out multiplexers, transmitters, switches, and SDM nodes. Results show that SDM fibers achieve a 1185-fold (18-fold) spectral-spatial efficiency increase compared with the 276-SMF bundle (single-core fiber) currently installed on the ground. In addition, an analysis of crosstalk in MCFs shows how SDM concepts can be further exploited to fit in various optical networks such as core, metro, and especially future intra-data center optical interconnects. Finally, research challenges and future directions are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Components performance per footprint area and volume", "Crosstalk", "Data-center networks", "Figures of merit", "Multicore fibers", "Space division multiplexing", "Spectral-spatial efficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Components performance per footprint area and volume", "Data center networks", "Figures of merits", "Multicore fiber", "Space division multiplexing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950256861", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56115136200": {"Name": "Saridis G.M.", "AuthorID": "56115136200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "12784155200": {"Name": "Simeonidou D.", "AuthorID": "12784155200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "12241488500": {"Name": "Alexandropoulos D.", "AuthorID": "12241488500", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science, University of Patras"}}}
