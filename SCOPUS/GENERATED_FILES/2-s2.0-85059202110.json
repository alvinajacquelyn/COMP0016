All rights reserved.Background: The relationship between body mass index (BMI) [weight (kg)/height (m 2)] and serious non-AIDS events is not well understood. Methods: We followed D:A:D study participants on antiretroviral therapy from their first BMI measurement to the first occurrence of the endpoint or end of follow-up (N = 41,149 followed for 295,147 person-years). The endpoints were cardiovascular disease (CVD); diabetes; non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) and BMI-NADCs (cancers known to be associated with BMI in general population); and all-cause mortality. Using Poisson regression models, we analyzed BMI as time-updated, lagged by 1 year, and categorized at: 18.5, 23, 25, 27.5, and 30 kg/m 2. Results: Participants were largely male (73%) with the mean age of 40 years (SD 9.7) and baseline median BMI of 23.3 (interquartile range: 21.2-25.7). Overall, BMI showed a statistically significant J-shaped relationship with the risk of all outcomes except diabetes. The relative risk (RR) for the BMI of <18.5 and >30 (95% confidence interval) compared with 23-25, respectively, was as follows: CVD: 1.46 (1.15-1.84) and 1.31 (1.03-1.67); NADCs: 1.78 (1.39-2.28) and 1.17 (0.88-1.54); and \"BMI-NADCs\": 1.29 (0.66-2.55) and 1.92 (1.10-3.36). For all-cause mortality, there was an interaction by sex (P < 0.001): RR in males: 2.47 (2.12-2.89) and 1.21 (0.97-1.50); and in females: 1.60 (1.30-1.98) and 1.02 (0.74-1.42). RR remained around 1 for intermediate categories of BMI. The risk of diabetes linearly increased with increasing BMI (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Risk of CVD, a range of cancers, and all-cause mortality increased at low BMI (<18.5) and then tended to increase only at BMI > 30 with a relatively low risk at BMI of 23-25 and 25-30. High BMI was also associated with risk of diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "all-cause mortality", "BMI", "HIV", "non-AIDS", "obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Cohort Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Poisson Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059202110", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"34771226200": {"Name": "Achhra A.C.", "AuthorID": "34771226200", "AffiliationID": "60019868", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, New York Presbyterian, Weill Cornell Medical Center"}, "55556254800": {"Name": "Law M.G.", "AuthorID": "55556254800", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, UNSW Australia, Wallace Wurth Building"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "54924488100": {"Name": "Ryom L.", "AuthorID": "54924488100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, 2Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "56058392600": {"Name": "Hatleberg C.", "AuthorID": "56058392600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, 2Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, 2Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "57205221502": {"Name": "Antonella D'Aminio M.", "AuthorID": "57205221502", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Clinica di Malattie Infettive e Tropicali, Azienda Ospedaliera-Polo Universitario San Paolo"}, "57203665572": {"Name": "De Wit S.", "AuthorID": "57203665572", "AffiliationID": "60029852, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Saint Pierre University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "57208854241": {"Name": "Pradier C.", "AuthorID": "57208854241", "AffiliationID": "60030964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Nice University Hospital"}, "7403384313": {"Name": "Weber R.", "AuthorID": "7403384313", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60172322", "AffiliationName": "HIV Monitoring Foundation"}, "57202563904": {"Name": "El-Sadr W.", "AuthorID": "57202563904", "AffiliationID": "60030162, 60006781", "AffiliationName": "ICAP-Columbia University, Harlem Hospital"}, "55845420102": {"Name": "Bonnet F.", "AuthorID": "55845420102", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905, 60116091, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "ISPED, INSERM U1219, CHU de Bordeaux, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux"}}}
