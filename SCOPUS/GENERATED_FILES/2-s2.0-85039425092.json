In this study, we present results from a passive listening ERP study showing that English speakers exhibit distinct neural responses to CCVC nonce words according to the phonological well-formedness and attestedness (in English) of the onset cluster. Clusters with poor sonority sequencing evoked an N400 effect compared to those without poor sonority sequencing, regardless of whether the well-formed clusters were attested in English. In contrast, unattested clusters, regardless of whether they were well-formed or ill-formed in terms of sonority sequencing, evoked a late positivity compared to attested clusters. The results suggest that listeners first perform a phonological analysis on potential words before submitting them to a lexical search.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Event related potentials", "Nonword acceptability", "Phonology", "Phonotactics", "Sonority"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039425092", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"56733088700": {"Name": "White J.", "AuthorID": "56733088700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56287837400": {"Name": "Chiu F.", "AuthorID": "56287837400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
