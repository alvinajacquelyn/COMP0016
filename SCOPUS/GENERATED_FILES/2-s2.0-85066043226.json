Key amongst these were changes in land use due to the spread and development of agricultural strategies, which may have had widespread consequences for the climate, hydrology, biodiversity, and ecosystem services of the region. Quantification of these land-use influences and potential feedbacks between human and natural systems is controversial, however, in part because the archaeological and historical record is highly fragmented in time and space. To improve our understanding of how humans contributed to the development of African landscapes, we developed an atlas of land-use practices in western Africa for nine time-windows over the period 1800 BC\u2013AD 1500. The maps are based on a broad synthesis of archaeological, archaeobotanical, archaeozoological, historical, linguistic, genetic, and ethnographic data, and present land use in 12 basic categories. The main differences between categories is the relative reliance on, and variety of, domesticated plant and animal species utilized, and the energy invested in cultivating or keeping them. The maps highlight the irregular and frequently non-linear trajectory of land-use change in the prehistory of western Africa. Representing an original attempt to produce rigorous spatial synthesis from diverse sources, the atlas will be useful for a range of studies of human\u2013environment interactions in the past, and highlight major spatial and temporal gaps in data that may guide future field studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Archaeobotany", "Archaeology", "Archaeozoology", "Human subsistence", "Iron age", "Land-use change", "Western Africa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066043226", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"56659095700": {"Name": "Kay A.U.", "AuthorID": "56659095700", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "7402737522": {"Name": "Kaplan J.O.", "AuthorID": "7402737522", "AffiliationID": "119730121", "AffiliationName": "ARVE Research SARL"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60001298", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Northwest University"}, "55968036900": {"Name": "Champion L.", "AuthorID": "55968036900", "AffiliationID": "60068584", "AffiliationName": "Archaeology Service, Royal Museum for Central Africa"}, "7202859776": {"Name": "Neumann K.", "AuthorID": "7202859776", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeological Sciences, Goethe-Universit\u00e4t"}, "26421178200": {"Name": "Eichhorn B.", "AuthorID": "26421178200", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeological Sciences, Goethe-Universit\u00e4t"}, "7004447675": {"Name": "H\u00f6hn A.", "AuthorID": "7004447675", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeological Sciences, Goethe-Universit\u00e4t"}, "55859735400": {"Name": "Morin-Rivat J.", "AuthorID": "55859735400", "AffiliationID": "60004026", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de biologie, chimie et g\u00e9ographie, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski"}, "22938496900": {"Name": "Linseele V.", "AuthorID": "22938496900", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"}, "6506575637": {"Name": "Huysecom E.", "AuthorID": "6506575637", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Archaeology and Population in Africa Laboratory, Anthropology Unit, Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of Geneva"}, "6504337229": {"Name": "Ozainne S.", "AuthorID": "6504337229", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Archaeology and Population in Africa Laboratory, Anthropology Unit, Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of Geneva"}, "56326302800": {"Name": "Lespez L.", "AuthorID": "56326302800", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de G\u00e9ographie Physique UMR CNRS 8591, Universit\u00e9 de Paris Est-Cr\u00e9teil"}, "26427985900": {"Name": "Biagetti S.", "AuthorID": "26427985900", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "55972575800": {"Name": "Madella M.", "AuthorID": "55972575800", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA"}, "6602208186": {"Name": "Salzmann U.", "AuthorID": "6602208186", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences, Northumbria University"}}}
