Materials and methods Anonymised data from individuals undergoing CTC after a positive FOBt in the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme were analysed. The detection of colorectal cancer (CRC), advanced neoplasia, and \u22656mm polyps were stratified by the number of positive FOBt windows. The PPV was calculated by reference to subsequent endoscopy results. The influence of the FOBt result on detection rates was estimated with multilevel logistic regression. PPV, CRC stage, and location were compared across groups according to FOBt positivity. Results Four thousand, six hundred and one individuals were included (mean =66.7 years, 54.2% men). Detection rates of CRC and advanced neoplasia increased with greater numbers of positive FOBt windows (odds ratio [OR] for CRC=1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-1.52; OR for advanced neoplasia=1.17; 95%CI: 1.12-1.23; both p<0.0001). The PPV was significantly greater at higher FOBt levels (p=0.020). The number of positive FOBt windows had no significant effect on stage (p=0.30) or location (p=0.20) of confirmed CRC. Conclusions The magnitude of FOBt positivity influences the PPV and detection rates when screening for colorectal neoplasia. CTC may be particularly useful for FOBt patients with few positive test windows.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Colonography, Computed Tomographic", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occult Blood", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941179038", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"14834275900": {"Name": "Plumb A.A.", "AuthorID": "14834275900", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College Hospital"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College Hospital"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College Hospital"}}}
