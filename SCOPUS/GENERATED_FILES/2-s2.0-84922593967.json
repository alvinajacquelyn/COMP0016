We investigated whether the analysis of seizure semiology including lateralizing seizure phenomena identifies bilateral independent temporal lobe seizure onset. Methods: We investigated the seizure semiology in 17 patients in whom invasive EEG-video-monitoring documented bilateral temporal seizure onset. The results were compared to 20 left and 20 right consecutive temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients who were seizure free after anterior temporal lobe resection. The seizure semiology was analyzed using the semiological seizure classification with particular emphasis on the sequence of seizure phenomena over time and lateralizing seizure phenomena. Statistical analysis included chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Bitemporal lobe epilepsy patients had more frequently different seizure semiology (100% vs. 40%; p<. 0.001) and significantly more often lateralizing seizure phenomena pointing to bilateral seizure onset compared to patients with unilateral TLE (67% vs. 11%; p<. 0.001). The sensitivity of identical vs. different seizure semiology for the identification of bilateral TLE was high (100%) with a specificity of 60%. Lateralizing seizure phenomena had a low sensitivity (59%) but a high specificity (89%). The combination of lateralizing seizure phenomena and different seizure semiology showed a high specificity (94%) but a low sensitivity (59%). Significance: The analysis of seizure semiology including lateralizing seizure phenomena adds important clinical information to identify patients with bilateral TLE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bitemporal", "Epilepsy surgery", "Lateralizing seizure phenomena", "Semiology", "Temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Seizures", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Video Recording", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922593967", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55881923400": {"Name": "Loesch A.", "AuthorID": "55881923400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "6603630976": {"Name": "Feddersen B.", "AuthorID": "6603630976", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "23979883500": {"Name": "Irsel Tezer F.", "AuthorID": "23979883500", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "55337265800": {"Name": "Hartl E.", "AuthorID": "55337265800", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "6603017948": {"Name": "R\u00e9mi J.", "AuthorID": "6603017948", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "6507426960": {"Name": "Vollmar C.", "AuthorID": "6507426960", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "56207842400": {"Name": "Noachtar S.", "AuthorID": "56207842400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Dept. of Neurology, University of Munich"}}}
