In the context of wider contested planning disputes for new places of worship for immigrant communities, the creation of a designated \u2018Assembly District\u2019 in Richmond emerged as a creative response to multicultural planning. However, it is also a contradictory policy, co-opting religious communities to municipal requirements to safeguard agricultural land and prevent suburban sprawl, but with limited success. The unanticipated outcomes of a designated planning zone for religious buildings include production of an agglomeration of increasingly spectacular religious facilities that exceed municipal planning regulations. Such developments are accommodated through a celebratory narrative of municipal multiculturalism, but one that fails to engage with the communal narratives of the faith communities themselves and may exoticize or commodify religious identity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multiculturalism", "Religion", "suburbs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958078644", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"]], "AuthorData": {"7004389465": {"Name": "Dwyer C.", "AuthorID": "7004389465", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "52364934700": {"Name": "Tse J.", "AuthorID": "52364934700", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Henry M.
