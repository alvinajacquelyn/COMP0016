The current investigation combines these 3 elements to detect deceptive intentions on a large scale. Participants read a model statement and wrote a truthful or deceptive statement about their planned weekend activities (Experiment 1). With the use of linguistic features for machine learning, more than 80% of the participants were classified correctly. Exploratory analyses suggested that liars included more person and location references than truth-tellers. Experiment 2 examined whether these findings replicated on independent-sample data. The classification accuracies remained well above chance level but dropped to 63%. Experiment 2 corroborated the finding that liars' statements are richer in location and person references than truth-tellers' statements. Together, these findings suggest that liars may over-prepare their statements. Predictive modeling shows promise as an automated veracity assessment approach but needs validation on independent data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["credibility assessment", "intentions", "machine learning", "model statement", "verbal deception detection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044719207", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"56518219900": {"Name": "Kleinberg B.", "AuthorID": "56518219900", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "57201420845": {"Name": "van der Toolen Y.", "AuthorID": "57201420845", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "7004860356": {"Name": "Arntz A.", "AuthorID": "7004860356", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "6602849119": {"Name": "Verschuere B.", "AuthorID": "6602849119", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "7005047215": {"Name": "Vrij A.", "AuthorID": "7005047215", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Portsmouth"}}}
