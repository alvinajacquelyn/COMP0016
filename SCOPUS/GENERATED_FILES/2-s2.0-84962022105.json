Here, we investigated the expression and function of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in enteroendocrine L cells producing GLP-1. By microarray and quantitative PCR analysis, we identified trpa1 as an L cell-enriched transcript in the small intestine. Calcium imaging of primary L cells and the model cell line GLUTag revealed responses triggered by the TRPA1 agonists allyl-isothiocyanate (mustard oil), carvacrol, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which were blocked by TRPA1 antagonists. Electrophysiology in GLUTag cells showed that carvacrol induced a current with characteristics typical of TRPA1 and triggered the firing of action potentials. TRPA1 activation caused an increase in GLP-1 secretion from primary murine intestinal cultures and GLUTag cells, an effect that was abolished in cultures from trpa1-/- mice or by pharmacological TRPA1 inhibition. These findings present TRPA1 as a novel sensory mechanism in enteroendocrine L cells, coupled to the facilitation of GLP-1 release, which may be exploitable as a target for treating diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Cells, Cultured", "Enteroendocrine Cells", "Glucagon-Like Peptide 1", "Intestine, Small", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Signal Transduction", "Transient Receptor Potential Channels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962022105", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"50061268500": {"Name": "Emery E.C.", "AuthorID": "50061268500", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60103296", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "14035533600": {"Name": "Diakogiannaki E.", "AuthorID": "14035533600", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60103296", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "55326104000": {"Name": "Psichas A.", "AuthorID": "55326104000", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60103296", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "57203082682": {"Name": "Reimann F.", "AuthorID": "57203082682", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60103296", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7004733731": {"Name": "Gribble F.M.", "AuthorID": "7004733731", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60103296", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7006170132": {"Name": "Gentry C.", "AuthorID": "7006170132", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "7005746396": {"Name": "Bevan S.", "AuthorID": "7005746396", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "10142504100": {"Name": "Habib A.M.", "AuthorID": "10142504100", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "55568523421": {"Name": "Fischer M.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55568523421", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}}}
