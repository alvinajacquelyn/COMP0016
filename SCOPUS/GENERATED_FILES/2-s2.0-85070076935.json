KGaA, WeinheimType I heterojunction films of \u03b1-Fe2O3/ZnO are reported here as a non-titania based photocatalyst, which shows remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic properties towards stearic acid degradation under UVA-light exposure (\u03bb=365 nm), with a quantum efficiency of \u03be=4.42\u00b11.54\u00d710\u22124 molecules degraded/photon, which was about 16 times greater than that of \u03b1-Fe2O3, and 2.5 times greater than that of ZnO. Considering that the degradation of stearic acid requires 104 electron transfers for each molecule, this represents an overall quantum efficiency of 4.60 % for the \u03b1-Fe2O3/ZnO heterojunction. Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) revealed the charge-carrier behaviour responsible for this increase in activity. Photogenerated electrons, formed in the ZnO layer, were transferred into the \u03b1-Fe2O3 layer on the pre-\u03bcs timescale, which reduced electron\u2013hole recombination. This increased the lifetime of photogenerated holes formed in ZnO, which oxidise stearic acid. The heterojunction \u03b1-Fe2O3/ZnO films grown herein show potential environmental applications as coatings for self-cleaning windows and surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aerosol-assisted CVD", "films", "hematite", "heterojunctions", "photocatalysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Electron transfer", "Environmental applications", "Hole recombination", "Photocatalytic property", "Photogenerated electrons", "Photogenerated holes", "Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070076935", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56155788500": {"Name": "Jiamprasertboon A.", "AuthorID": "56155788500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Material Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35099379100": {"Name": "Siritanon T.", "AuthorID": "35099379100", "AffiliationID": "60026326", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology"}, "35933361700": {"Name": "Ling M.", "AuthorID": "35933361700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Material Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56825506400": {"Name": "Alotaibi A.M.", "AuthorID": "56825506400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Material Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Material Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Material Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "26039181400": {"Name": "Kafizas A.", "AuthorID": "26039181400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Grantham Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57190578139": {"Name": "Sachs M.", "AuthorID": "57190578139", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Grantham Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
