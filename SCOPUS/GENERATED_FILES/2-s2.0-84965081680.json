However, since HIV-associated TB frequently remains unascertained, we systematically reviewed autopsy studies to determine the true burden of TB at death. Methods: We systematically searched Medline and Embase databases (to end 2013) for literature reporting on health facility-based autopsy studies of HIV-infected adults and/or children in resource-limited settings. Using forest plots and random-effects meta-analysis, we summarized the TB prevalence found at autopsy and used meta-regression to explore variables associated with autopsy TB prevalence. Results: We included 36 eligible studies, reporting on 3237 autopsies. Autopsy TB prevalence was extremely heterogeneous (range 0-64.4%), but was markedly higher in adults [pooled prevalence 39.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 32.4-47.0%] compared to children (pooled prevalence 4.5%, 95% CI 1.7-7.4%). Post-mortem TB prevalence varied by world region, with pooled estimates in adults of 63.2% (95% CI 57.7-68.7%) in South Asia (n=2 studies); 43.2% (95% CI 38.0-48.3) in sub-Saharan Africa (n=9 studies); and 27.1% (95% CI 16.0-38.1%) in the Americas (n=5 studies). Autopsy prevalence positively correlated with contemporary estimates of national TB prevalence. TB in adults was disseminated in 87.9% (82.2-93.7%) of cases and was considered the cause of death in 91.4% (95% CI 85.8-97.0%) of TB cases. Overall, TB was the cause of death in 37.2% (95% CI 25.7-48.7%) of adult HIV/AIDS-related deaths. TB remained undiagnosed at death in 45.8% (95% CI 32.6-59.1%) of TB cases. Conclusions: In resource-limited settings, TB accounts for approximately 40% of facility-based HIV/AIDS-related adult deaths. Almost half of this disease remains undiagnosed at the time of death. These findings highlight the critical need to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated TB globally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "autopsy", "death", "HIV", "mortality", "post mortem", "prevalence", "resource-limited settings", "tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Americas", "Asia", "Autopsy", "Developing Countries", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Tuberculosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965081680", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56645308000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56645308000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7202090920": {"Name": "Lucas S.B.", "AuthorID": "7202090920", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35493200400": {"Name": "Fielding K.L.", "AuthorID": "35493200400", "AffiliationID": "109584070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "7006905471": {"Name": "Lawn S.D.", "AuthorID": "7006905471", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60172628", "AffiliationName": "Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}}}
