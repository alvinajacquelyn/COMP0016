In this paper, we review the genetic basis of FH and its impact on the clinical presentation. Recent Findings: Mutations in any of three genes (LDLR, APOB and PCSK9) are known to cause autosomal dominant FH, but a mutation can be found in only \u223c40% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH. In the remainder, a polygenic aetiology is most likely, due to the co-inheritance of common LDL-C-raising variants. The cardiovascular presentation and management of FH will differ between patients based on their underlying genetic factors. Summary: New genotyping methods such as next-generation sequencing will provide us with better understanding of the genetic architecture of FH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["APOB gene", "Familial hypercholesterolaemia", "LDLR gene", "PCSK9 gene", "Polygenic hypercholesterolaemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apolipoprotein B-100", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Mutation", "Proprotein Convertase 9", "Receptors, LDL"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017548561", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56173947700": {"Name": "Sharifi M.", "AuthorID": "56173947700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55446094500": {"Name": "Futema M.", "AuthorID": "55446094500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005754649": {"Name": "Nair D.", "AuthorID": "7005754649", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
