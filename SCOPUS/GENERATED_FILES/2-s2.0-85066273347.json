We consider such constraints on a well-motivated model involving a gauged and spontaneously-broken B \u2212 L symmetry, within the Contur framework. The model contains an extra Higgs boson, a gauge boson, and right-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses. This new particle content implies a varied phenomenology highly dependent on the parameters of the model, very well-suited to a general study of this kind. We find that existing LHC measurements significantly constrain the model in interesting regions of parameter space. Other regions remain open, some of which are within reach of future LHC data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beyond Standard Model", "Global features", "Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments)", "Hard scattering", "Particle and resonance production"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066273347", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57209002540": {"Name": "Amrith S.", "AuthorID": "57209002540", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "56435539400": {"Name": "Butterworth J.M.", "AuthorID": "56435539400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "8903178300": {"Name": "Deppisch F.F.", "AuthorID": "8903178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "57203684128": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "57203684128", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "57204115298": {"Name": "Varma A.", "AuthorID": "57204115298", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "57193697134": {"Name": "Yallup D.", "AuthorID": "57193697134", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}}}
