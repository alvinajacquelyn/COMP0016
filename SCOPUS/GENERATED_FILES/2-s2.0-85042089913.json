All rights reserved.The 5 February 2016, Meinong, Taiwan, earthquake brought extensive damage to nearby cities with significant pulse-like velocity ground motions. In addition to the spatial slip distribution determination using filtered strong-motion data, we show that, with the advantage of the densely distributed seismic network as a seismic array, we can project the earthquake sources (asperities) directly using nearly unfiltered data, which is crucial to the understanding of the generation of the pulse-like velocity ground motions. We recognize that the moderate but damaging ML 6.6 Meinong earthquake was a composite of an Mw 5.5 foreshock and an Mw 6.18 mainshock with a 1.8\u20135.0 s time delay. The foreshock occurred at the hypocenter reported by the official agency, followed by the mainshock with a centroid located at 12.3 km to the north-northwest of the hypocenter and at a depth of 15 km. This foreshock\u2013mainshock composition is not distinguishable in the finite-fault inversion because it filtered the seismic data to low frequencies. Our results show that the pulse-like velocity ground motions are mainly attributed to the source of mainshock with its directivity and site effects, resulting in the disastrous damages in the city of Tainan. Although finite-fault inversion using filtered seismic data for spatial slip distribution on the fault has been a classic procedure in understanding earthquake rupture processes, using a dense seismic network as a seismic array for unfiltered records helps us delineate the earthquake sources directly and provide more delicate information for future understanding of earthquake source complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Earthquake rupture process", "Earthquake source", "Finite fault inversions", "Meinong , Taiwan", "Seismic networks", "Slip distribution", "Source characteristics", "Strong motion datum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042089913", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"54894705300": {"Name": "Lin Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "54894705300", "AffiliationID": "60086312, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Seismological Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "56398960000": {"Name": "Yeh T.Y.", "AuthorID": "56398960000", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, San Diego State University"}, "7601411574": {"Name": "Lee S.J.", "AuthorID": "7601411574", "AffiliationID": "60011081, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "7403681659": {"Name": "Huang B.S.", "AuthorID": "7403681659", "AffiliationID": "60011081, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "7202837121": {"Name": "Ma K.F.", "AuthorID": "7202837121", "AffiliationID": "60024666", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, National Central University"}, "7202363863": {"Name": "Song T.R.A.", "AuthorID": "7202363863", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7406889485": {"Name": "Wu Y.M.", "AuthorID": "7406889485", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University"}}}
