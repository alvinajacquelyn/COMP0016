This paper presents a proof-of-concept study using eye tracking to compare fixation data between native readers of a French literary source text and native readers of its English translation at specific, corresponding points in the texts. The preliminary data are consistent with previous findings on the relationship between the features of the fixated word and fixation durations. These findings are also consistent with stylistic analyses and indicate that this method can be used to compare the levels of cognitive effort between two readership groups in order to investigate whether their experience is similar\u2013whether an \u2018equivalent effect\u2019 has been achieved\u2013thus contributing to the ongoing discourse surrounding equivalence in translation studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive effort", "cognitive translation studies", "equivalence", "equivalent effect", "Eye tracking", "reception"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058244404", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201315510": {"Name": "Walker C.", "AuthorID": "57201315510", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translation Studies (CenTraS), University College London"}}}
