This study examines longitudinal associations between cyberbullying involvement and adolescent mental health. Methods Participants were 2,480 teenagers taking part in the Olympic Regeneration in East London study. We collected information from participants when they were 12\u201313 years old and again 1 year later to examine links between involvement in cyberbullying and future symptoms of depression and social anxiety, and mental well-being. Results At baseline, 14% reported being cybervictims, 8% reported being cyberbullies, and 20% reported being cyberbully-victims in the previous year. Compared to uninvolved adolescents, cybervictims and cyberbully-victims were significantly more likely to report symptoms of depression (cybervictims: odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.00, 2.06]; cyberbully-victims: OR = 1.54, 95% CI [1.13, 2.09]) and social anxiety (cybervictims: OR = 1.52, 95% CI [1.11, 2.07]; cyberbully-victims: OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.10, 1.89]) but not below average well-being (cybervictims: relative risk ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [.86, 1.91]; cyberbully-victims: relative risk ratio = 1.38, 95% CI [.95, 1.99]) at 1 year follow-up, after adjustment for confounding factors including baseline mental health. Conclusions This study emphasizes the high prevalence of cyberbullying and the potential of cybervictimization as a risk factor for future depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and below average well-being among adolescents. Future research should identify protective factors and possible interventions to reduce adolescent cyberbullying.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Cyberbullying", "Depression", "Mental health", "Social anxiety", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Adolescent Health", "Anxiety", "Bullying", "Child", "Crime Victims", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Odds Ratio", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994896427", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55353606500": {"Name": "Fahy A.", "AuthorID": "55353606500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55666438900": {"Name": "Stansfeld S.", "AuthorID": "55666438900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55752688200": {"Name": "Smuk M.", "AuthorID": "55752688200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55313173900": {"Name": "Smith N.", "AuthorID": "55313173900", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Social Research, Policy Research Centre"}, "8723105800": {"Name": "Clark C.", "AuthorID": "8723105800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "9735960200": {"Name": "Cummins S.", "AuthorID": "9735960200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
