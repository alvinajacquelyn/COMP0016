In extreme cases, children and adolescents may have to move away from their family to a permanent residential placement. A potentially more appropriate and cost-effective approach is the provision of family support services; predominantly these have taken the form of short break schemes, whereby temporary (respite) care is issued to provide short-term relief for the family (e.g. regular afternoon care).
