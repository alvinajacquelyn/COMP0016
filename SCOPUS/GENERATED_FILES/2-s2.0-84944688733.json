However, little is yet known about service users' subjective experiences of CBTp. Aims: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of qualitative literature to examine service user perspective of CBTp. Method: A thematic synthesis of qualitative studies examining service users' experiences of CBTp was conducted. A total of six studies were included in the analysis. Results: Three superordinate themes were identified: therapeutic alliance; facilitating change; and challenges of applying CBTp. Conclusion: Overall, CBTp is a helpful and acceptable therapeutic approach to service users. Developing a collaborative therapeutic relationship is essential. The applications of CBTp can be problematic and the therapist and client need to work together to overcome these difficulties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive behaviour therapy", "psychosis", "Thematic synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive Therapy", "Humans", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944688733", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust, Psychology Services"}, "56489883100": {"Name": "Burke E.", "AuthorID": "56489883100", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust, Psychology Services"}, "7402258312": {"Name": "Morrison A.", "AuthorID": "7402258312", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust, Psychology Services"}}}
