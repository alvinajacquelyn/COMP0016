Currently, these fuels are mainly composed of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil. Over the past two decades, biomass has gained significant attention as a renewable feedstock for more sustainable biofuel production and has been a great candidate to replace fossil fuels. The principal components of most of the available biomass are cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin. Although the available green technologies for biofuel production are progressing rapidly, productivity and chemical yield from these techniques are still below the required values. Therefore, there is a need for interdisciplinary studies to meet the requirements for more global and efficient production by streamlining processes, integrating technologies and achieving techno-economic improvements. In this context, we aim to give an overview of available biomass such as agricultural wastes suitable for the generation of different classes of biofuels including next-generation biofuels. Unfortunately, expensive, wasteful and energy-consuming pretreatment processes are still used. Therefore, novel technologies that allow a more efficient separation with low resource consumption and the generation of a low number of residues are required. In this regard, novel technologies such as efficient fractionation techniques and genetic and metabolic engineering including the application of CRISPR/Cas tools, as well as microfluidic platforms to improve the overall yield of biofuel production are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067458809", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"56938820300": {"Name": "Kamani M.H.", "AuthorID": "56938820300", "AffiliationID": "60031777", "AffiliationName": "Young Researchers and Elite Club, Sabzevar Branch, Islamic Azad University"}, "56507330400": {"Name": "E\u015f I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "57195195602": {"Name": "Lorenzo J.M.", "AuthorID": "57195195602", "AffiliationID": "60122054", "AffiliationName": "Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico de la Carne de Galicia, Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Galicia San CibraodasVi\u00f1as"}, "8768998000": {"Name": "Remize F.", "AuthorID": "8768998000", "AffiliationID": "60000485, 60031011, 60083820, 60031214, 60108488", "AffiliationName": "UMR QualiSud, Universit\u00e9 de la R\u00e9union, CIRAD, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon"}, "56449272100": {"Name": "Rosell\u00f3-Soto E.", "AuthorID": "56449272100", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Food Science Area, Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Science, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "36190434200": {"Name": "Barba F.J.", "AuthorID": "36190434200", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Food Science Area, Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Science, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "57218227445": {"Name": "Clark J.", "AuthorID": "57218227445", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence, Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57203634349": {"Name": "Mousavi Khaneghah A.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}}}
