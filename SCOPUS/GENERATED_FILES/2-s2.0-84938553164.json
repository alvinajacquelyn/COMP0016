The compiled data are used to derive mathematical correlations based on the Abraham solvation parameter model. The derived expressions describe the experimental solvation enthalpies in diethyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate to within standard deviations of 2.1 and 2.7 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham model", "diethyl carbonate", "dimethyl carbonate", "enthalpy of solvation", "hydrogen-bonding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham model", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "Diethyl carbonates", "Dimethyl carbonate", "Enthalpy of solvation", "Mathematical correlation", "Solvation enthalpy", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938553164", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538081100": {"Name": "Grover D.", "AuthorID": "56538081100", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538213300": {"Name": "Zettl H.", "AuthorID": "56538213300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
