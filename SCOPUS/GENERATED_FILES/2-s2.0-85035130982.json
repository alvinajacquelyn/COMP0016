This study aims at investigating the effects of in vivo like dynamic load\u2013compression integrated with shearing on tissue regeneration, particularly to identify the role played by shearing induced from rotational motion. Tissue samples fabricated from a calcium alginate hydrogel embedded with chondrocytes were subjected to a dynamic tissue culture. Three culturing regimes were included: a static culture control (CON), compression combined with shearing induced from translational motion (CS), and compression combined with shearing induced from both translational and rotational motion (CSR). The results indicate that the CS group has a significantly larger chondrocyte proliferation rate (p <.01), and that the CSR group has no advantages over the CS group. However, the CSR group was found to have a marked influence on the matrix synthesis compared to that of the CS group (p <.01). It can be concluded that shearing from individual joint motions offers a different contribution to the chondrocyte proliferation, matrix synthesis, and phenotype maintenance, and better insight into these individual roles will be necessary for determining the efficacy of in vivo/vitro cartilageous tissue functionalization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Joint movements", "Mechanical stimuli", "Shearing", "Tissue engineered cartilage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chondrocyte proliferation", "Compressive loading", "Engineered cartilage", "Functional testing", "Joint movement", "Mechanical stimulus", "Tissue engineered cartilage", "Translational motions", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cartilage, Articular", "Cell Proliferation", "Chondrocytes", "Collagen", "Finite Element Analysis", "Glycosaminoglycans", "Knee Joint", "Materials Testing", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Rabbits", "Shear Strength", "Stress, Mechanical", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035130982", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57034587600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57034587600", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "57199935145": {"Name": "Shen H.", "AuthorID": "57199935145", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "57197833765": {"Name": "Nie J.", "AuthorID": "57197833765", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "35787219200": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "35787219200", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "7403625753": {"Name": "Jin Z.", "AuthorID": "7403625753", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "17343310000": {"Name": "Fan H.", "AuthorID": "17343310000", "AffiliationID": "60069708, 60088187", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Xi-Jing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "John Scale Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}}}
