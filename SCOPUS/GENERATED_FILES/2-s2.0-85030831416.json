The results indicate that the main groups of glass at S\u012br\u0101f likely date to the 9th\u2013early 11th centuries and can be subdivided by the trace elements zirconium and chromium. Chemical matches with some likely Indian glass, and with glass finds from South and Southeast Asia, underline the pivotal role of the Gulf in the eastward movement of Islamic glass via the Indian Ocean trade network, as well as the influx of Indian glass into the Islamic world. Glass bangles and a small number of vessel fragments likely date to the late 11th century or later, and their chemical compositions indicate different production origins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bangles", "Chromium", "Gulf", "High alumina", "Indian Ocean trade", "Iran", "Islamic glass", "LA-ICPMS", "Manganese", "S\u012br\u0101f, Siraf", "Zirconium"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030831416", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57194632336": {"Name": "Swan C.M.", "AuthorID": "57194632336", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}, "26428210200": {"Name": "Lankton J.", "AuthorID": "26428210200", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "6506982186": {"Name": "Gratuze B.", "AuthorID": "6506982186", "AffiliationID": "60029689, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche sur les Arch\u00e9oMAT\u00e9riaux (IRAMAT), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universit\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans"}, "23056475100": {"Name": "Brill R.H.", "AuthorID": "23056475100", "AffiliationID": "100405316", "AffiliationName": "Corning Museum of Glass"}}}
