BI can be defined as a non-contributory, universal and unconditional cash transfer paid out on an individual basis. The project was conducted as a cluster randomised trial involving 2034 households. Three health outcomes were examined: minor illnesses and injuries, illness and injuries requiring hospitalisation, and child vaccination coverage. The data were analysed with multiple imputation, propensity score matching and weighted logistic regression. BI was seen to significantly reduce the odds of minor illnesses and injuries by 46 per cent. No effect was seen on more serious illnesses and injuries, at least not in the time scale given, nor on child vaccination coverage which was already exceptionally high. Policymakers are encouraged to consider BI as an equitable policy of social protection, though further research on its impact on health is desirable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basic income", "cash transfer", "cluster randomised trial", "propensity score", "social protection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921894251", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"56396091000": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "56396091000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Global Health, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "37011550600": {"Name": "Pulkki-Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m A.", "AuthorID": "37011550600", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Global Health, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "6603783681": {"Name": "San Sebasti\u00e1n M.", "AuthorID": "6603783681", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Global Health, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
