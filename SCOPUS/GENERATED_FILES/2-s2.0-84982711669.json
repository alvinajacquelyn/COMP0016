A welcome development has been the enactment of a special law-Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) 2012- criminalising a range of acts including child rape, harassment, and exploitation for pornography. The law mandates setting up of Special Courts to facilitate speedy trials in CSA cases. The paper highlights the intended benefits and the unintended consequences that might arise from the application of the law in the Indian context. Undoubtedly, the passing of POCSO has been a major step forward in securing children's rights and furthering the cause of protecting children against sexual abuse in conjunction with a related legislation to clamp down on child marriages called the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006. The letter and spirit of the law, which defines a child as anyone under 18 years of age, is to protect children from sexual abuse. However, criminalising all sexual behaviour under 18 years of age can be problematic. This paper identifies three main issues arising from POCSO: age of consent, age determination, and mandatory reporting; issues that highlight the fact that well-meaning laws can nevertheless have unintended negative consequences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child marriage", "Child sex abuse", "Consensual underage sex", "India", "POCSO"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982711669", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"26532370500": {"Name": "Belur J.", "AuthorID": "26532370500", "AffiliationID": "60090044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, Jill Dando Institute, University College London"}, "57202677121": {"Name": "Singh B.B.", "AuthorID": "57202677121", "AffiliationID": "120872753", "AffiliationName": "State Crime Records Bureau, Criminal Investigation Department, Maharashtra Police"}}}
