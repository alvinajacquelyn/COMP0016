However, because property sale price partly reflects speculation on future capital gains, it sheds little light on the renters\u2019 willingness-to-pay for living near public transportation facilities, let alone the variation in rent premium for transit proximity. We in this paper employ a spatial quantile hedonic regression method to gauge the rental impact of metro stations on a large sample of two-bedroom-one-bathroom (2b1b) apartments across 2575 residential complex communities (or \u201cxiaoqu\u201d in mandarin Chinese) in Shanghai, China, as observed between December 2012 and January 2013. We find: a) a community's geographic adjacency to the nearest Shanghai Metro station tends to correlate positively with the xiaoqu's average asking rent of 2b1b apartments, indicating a significant rent premium for transit proximity; b) although the transit premium fluctuates across the different rent levels, the variation is statistically insignificant, suggesting no evidence of transit-induced segmentation of the local private residential rental market. Apart from its policy implications, this paper demonstrates a US-China comparative perspective and a novel spatial quantile regression approach to test the segmentation effect of mass transit in a dynamic urban housing market.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Public transit", "Rent premium", "Segmentation", "Shanghai metro"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966550744", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"55894601800": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55894601800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}, "57189234999": {"Name": "Cheng S.", "AuthorID": "57189234999", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}, "57211754537": {"Name": "Feng S.", "AuthorID": "57211754537", "AffiliationID": "60032744", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Administration, School of Public Economics and Administration, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"}, "56441957500": {"Name": "Deng Z.", "AuthorID": "56441957500", "AffiliationID": "60175853", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Finance University & Leixury Consulting LTD"}}}
