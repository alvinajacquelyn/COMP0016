Interest is now focused on structurally conserved protein domains capable of eliciting protection against a broad range of influenza virus strains. The long alpha helix (LAH) is an attractive vaccine component since it is one of the most conserved influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stalk regions. For an improved immune response, the LAH domain from H3N2 strain has been incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) using recently developed tandem core technology. Results: Fermentation conditions for recombinant HBc-LAH were established in yeast Pichia pastoris and a rapid and efficient purification method for chimeric VLPs was developed to match the requirements for industrial scale-up. Purified VLPs induced strong antibody responses against both group 1 and group 2 HA proteins in mice. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the tandem core technology is a useful tool for incorporation of highly hydrophobic LAH domain into HBc VLPs. Chimeric VLPs can be successfully produced in bioreactor using yeast expression system. Immunologic data indicate that HBc VLPs carrying the LAH antigen represent a promising universal influenza vaccine component.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Influenza vaccine", "Long alpha helix", "Tandem-core", "Virus-like particles", "Yeast"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alpha helix", "Conserved proteins", "Fermentation conditions", "Industrial scale up", "Influenza vaccines", "Purification method", "Tandem-core", "Virus-like particles", "Animals", "Antibodies, Viral", "Female", "Hemagglutinins, Viral", "Hepatitis B Core Antigens", "Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype", "Influenza Vaccines", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Pichia", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Virion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033459649", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"]], "AuthorData": {"6602540690": {"Name": "Kazaks A.", "AuthorID": "6602540690", "AffiliationID": "60071045", "AffiliationName": "Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre"}, "55249707200": {"Name": "Akopjana I.", "AuthorID": "55249707200", "AffiliationID": "60071045", "AffiliationName": "Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre"}, "55249707500": {"Name": "Bogans J.", "AuthorID": "55249707500", "AffiliationID": "60071045", "AffiliationName": "Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre"}, "6701386072": {"Name": "Ose V.", "AuthorID": "6701386072", "AffiliationID": "60071045", "AffiliationName": "Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre"}, "57196471676": {"Name": "Kirsteina A.", "AuthorID": "57196471676", "AffiliationID": "60071045", "AffiliationName": "Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre"}, "57196465074": {"Name": "Kazaka T.", "AuthorID": "57196465074", "AffiliationID": "60071045", "AffiliationName": "Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre"}, "35518184300": {"Name": "Tars K.", "AuthorID": "35518184300", "AffiliationID": "60071043", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Department of Molecular Biology"}, "55962957200": {"Name": "Lu I.N.", "AuthorID": "55962957200", "AffiliationID": "60072560", "AffiliationName": "Luxembourg Institute of Health, Department of Infection and Immunity"}, "6506241696": {"Name": "Farinelle S.", "AuthorID": "6506241696", "AffiliationID": "60072560", "AffiliationName": "Luxembourg Institute of Health, Department of Infection and Immunity"}, "55758464800": {"Name": "Muller C.P.", "AuthorID": "55758464800", "AffiliationID": "60072560", "AffiliationName": "Luxembourg Institute of Health, Department of Infection and Immunity"}, "57105893600": {"Name": "Ramirez A.", "AuthorID": "57105893600", "AffiliationID": "60122138", "AffiliationName": "IQur Limited"}, "57196470459": {"Name": "Crescente V.", "AuthorID": "57196470459", "AffiliationID": "60122138", "AffiliationName": "IQur Limited"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.M.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine"}, "57196465823": {"Name": "Blaha B.", "AuthorID": "57196465823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "6505809295": {"Name": "Ogonah O.", "AuthorID": "6505809295", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "8410544700": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay T.", "AuthorID": "8410544700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "6504602476": {"Name": "de Obanos M.P.", "AuthorID": "6504602476", "AffiliationID": "119750615", "AffiliationName": "Biopharmaceuticals SL"}, "6508381739": {"Name": "Krimer A.", "AuthorID": "6508381739", "AffiliationID": "119750615", "AffiliationName": "Biopharmaceuticals SL"}, "6603610969": {"Name": "Stonehouse N.J.", "AuthorID": "6603610969", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds, Faculty of Biological Sciences"}, "7103109103": {"Name": "Rowlands D.J.", "AuthorID": "7103109103", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds, Faculty of Biological Sciences"}}}
