Differences between flame spread in purely buoyant and purely forced flows are presented. Prior to these experiments, only samples of small size in small confined volumes had been tested in space. Therefore the first and third flights in the experimental series, called \u201cSaffire,\u201d studied large-scale flame spread over a 94 cm long by 40.6 cm wide cotton-fiberglass fabric. The second flight examined an array of nine smaller samples of various materials each measuring 29 cm long by 5 cm wide. Among them were two of the same cotton-fiberglass fabric used in the large-scale tests and a thick, flat PMMA sample (1-cm thick). The forced airflow was 20\u201325 cm/s, which is typical of air circulation speeds in a spacecraft. The experiments took place aboard the Cygnus vehicle, a large unmanned resupply spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). The experiments were carried out in orbit before the Cygnus vehicle, reloaded with ISS trash, re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and perished. The downloaded test data show that a concurrent (downstream) spreading flame over thin fabrics in microgravity reaches a steady spread rate and a limiting length. The flame over the thick PMMA sample approaches a non-growing, steady state in the 15 min burning duration and has a limiting pyrolysis length. In contrast, upward (concurrent) flame spread at normal gravity on Earth is usually found to be accelerating so that the flame size grows with time. The existence of a flame size limit has important considerations for spacecraft fire safety as it can be used to establish the heat release rate in the vehicle. The findings and the scientific explanations of this series of innovative, novel and unique experiments are presented, analyzed and discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fire safety", "Flame propagation", "Flammability", "Microgravity", "Scale"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental series", "Fiberglass fabrics", "Fire safety", "Flame propagation", "Heat Release Rate (HRR)", "International Space stations", "Pyrolysis lengths", "Scale"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055480467", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35562688400": {"Name": "Urban D.L.", "AuthorID": "35562688400", "AffiliationID": "60026717", "AffiliationName": "NASA Glenn Research Center"}, "6507929703": {"Name": "Ferkul P.", "AuthorID": "6507929703", "AffiliationID": "60026717", "AffiliationName": "NASA Glenn Research Center"}, "7202063336": {"Name": "Olson S.", "AuthorID": "7202063336", "AffiliationID": "60026717", "AffiliationName": "NASA Glenn Research Center"}, "7005398548": {"Name": "Ruff G.A.", "AuthorID": "7005398548", "AffiliationID": "60026717", "AffiliationName": "NASA Glenn Research Center"}, "7102304791": {"Name": "Easton J.", "AuthorID": "7102304791", "AffiliationID": "60026717", "AffiliationName": "NASA Glenn Research Center"}, "57200805433": {"Name": "T'ien J.S.", "AuthorID": "57200805433", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "55966788100": {"Name": "Liao Y.T.T.", "AuthorID": "55966788100", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "57189511962": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "57189511962", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "56676952500": {"Name": "Fernandez-Pello C.", "AuthorID": "56676952500", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "UC Berkeley"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland"}, "7004349292": {"Name": "Legros G.", "AuthorID": "7004349292", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60112303", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS"}, "6603821217": {"Name": "Eigenbrod C.", "AuthorID": "6603821217", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "University of Bremen (ZARM)"}, "35571666000": {"Name": "Smirnov N.", "AuthorID": "35571666000", "AffiliationID": "60007457, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Lomonosov Moscow State University, Federal Science Center, NIISI Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7004673028": {"Name": "Fujita O.", "AuthorID": "7004673028", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Hokkaido University"}, "6507977244": {"Name": "Rouvreau S.", "AuthorID": "6507977244", "AffiliationID": "117465506", "AffiliationName": "Belisama R&D"}, "54978099100": {"Name": "Toth B.", "AuthorID": "54978099100", "AffiliationID": "60031159", "AffiliationName": "ESA ESTEC"}, "6506544633": {"Name": "Jomaas G.", "AuthorID": "6506544633", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}}}
