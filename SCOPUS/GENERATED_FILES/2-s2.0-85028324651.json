Based on the channel knowledge of each user, the analog combiner for each user is independently designed based on the singular value decomposition (SVD), while the analog precoder is obtained by the conjugate transposition to maximize the effective channel gain. Then, with the resulting effective analog channel, low-dimensional baseband precoders can be efficiently applied. The proposed scheme requires no optimization techniques or any complicated iterative algorithms, while the numerical results show that it can approach the performance of fully digital schemes and even achieve a better performance in some scenarios. It is also observed that sub-connected structures can achieve a much higher power efficiency compared to fully-connected structures and are therefore promising for the future green communication systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hybrid design", "Millimeter-Wave", "MU-MIMO", "power efficiency", "SVD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028324651", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Eng., University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Eng., University College London"}}}
