As fresh news articles are frequently coming to the system while the old ones are fading away quickly, building a consistent and coherent feature representation over the ever-changing articles pool is fundamental to the performance of the recommendation. However, learning a good feature representation is challenging, especially for some small publishers that have normally fewer than 10,000 articles each year. In this paper, we consider to transfer knowledge from a larger text corpus. In our proposed solution, an effective article recommendation engine can be established with a small number of target publisher articles by transferring knowledge from a large corpus of text with a different distribution. Specifically, we leverage noise contrastive estimation techniques to learn the word conditional distribution given the context words, where the noise conditional distribution is pre-trained from the large corpus. Our solution has been deployed in a commercial recommendation service. The large-scale online A/B testing on two commercial publishers demonstrates up to 9.97% relative overall performance gain of our proposed model on the recommendation click-though rate metric over the non-transfer learning baselines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Article recommendation", "Noise contrastive estimation", "Text representation", "Transfer learning", "Word2Vec"], "IndexKeywords": ["Article recommendation", "Conditional distribution", "Content recommendations", "Different distributions", "Personalized recommendation", "Text representation", "Transfer learning", "Word2Vec"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037337799", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"57198892084": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57198892084", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56108513500": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "56108513500", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "8723751600": {"Name": "Yu Y.", "AuthorID": "8723751600", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "57198890118": {"Name": "Tao G.", "AuthorID": "57198890118", "AffiliationID": "119875907", "AffiliationName": "ULU Technologies Inc."}, "55902731900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55902731900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
