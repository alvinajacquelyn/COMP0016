Prenatal Diagnosis published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Objective: We developed an in vitro model to examine whether trauma induces connexin 43 (Cx43) expression and collagen organisation in the amniotic membrane (AM) of fetal membrane (FM) defects. Method: Term human FM was traumatised in vitro. Cell morphology and Cx43 were examined in the wound edge AM by immunofluorescence (IMF) confocal microscopy and compared to control AM. Collagen microstructure was examined by second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. Cell viability was assessed with calcein and ethidium staining. Results: After trauma, the AM showed a dense region of cells, which had migrated towards the wound edge. In wound edge AM, Cx43 puncta was preferentially distributed in mesenchymal cells compared to epithelial cells with significant expression in the fibroblast layer than epithelial layer (p < 0.001). In the fibroblast layer, the collagen fibres were highly polarised and aligned in parallel to the axis of the wound edge AM. There was an absence of cell migration across the defect with no healing after 168 h. Cell viability of the FM after trauma was maintained during culture. Conclusion: Cx43 overexpression in wounded AM drives structural changes in collagen that slows down efficacy of cell migration across the FM defect. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
