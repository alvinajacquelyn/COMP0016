Despite the wealth of studies on the neural correlates of navigation little is known about backtracking. To explore the neural underpinnings of backtracking we tested humans during functional magnetic resonance imaging on their ability to navigate to a set of goal locations in a virtual desert island riven by lava which constrained the paths that could be taken. We found that on a subset of trials, participants spontaneously chose to backtrack and that the majority of these choices were optimal. During backtracking, activity increased in frontal regions and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, while activity was suppressed in regions associated with the core default-mode network. Using the same task, magnetoencephalography and a separate group of participants, we found that power in the alpha band was significantly decreased immediately prior to such backtracking events. These results highlight the importance for navigation of brain networks previously identified in processing internally-generated errors and that such error-detection responses may involve shifting the brain from default-mode states to aid successful spatial orientation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha", "Backtracking", "DACC", "Navigation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Spatial Navigation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070840567", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.H.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "54996374100": {"Name": "Patai E.Z.", "AuthorID": "54996374100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, University College London"}, "23477757700": {"Name": "Marin-Garcia E.", "AuthorID": "23477757700", "AffiliationID": "60027856", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)"}, "57209586821": {"Name": "Tan H.R.M.", "AuthorID": "57209586821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, University College London"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57210470937": {"Name": "Margois A.", "AuthorID": "57210470937", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "8650774800": {"Name": "Kumaran D.", "AuthorID": "8650774800", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "Google Deepmind"}, "8249732800": {"Name": "Nardini M.", "AuthorID": "8249732800", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Durham University"}, "7006713116": {"Name": "Penny W.", "AuthorID": "7006713116", "AffiliationID": "60160138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "Duzel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60072303", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research (IkND), University Hospital Magdeburg"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60004898", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics"}}}
