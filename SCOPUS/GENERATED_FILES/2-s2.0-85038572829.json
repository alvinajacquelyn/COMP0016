All rights reserved.We report the development of a novel flow cytometry-based Ig capture assay (ICA) for the identification and sorting of individual Ab-secreting cells based on their Ag reactivity. The ICA represents a fast and versatile tool for single-cell sorting of peripheral plasmablasts, streamlining subsequent Ab analysis, and cloning. We demonstrate the utility of the assay by isolating Ag-reactive plasmablasts from cryopreserved PBMC obtained from volunteers vaccinated with a recombinant HIV envelope protein. To show the specificity of the ICA, we produced Ag-specific Abs from these cells and subsequently verified their Ag reactivity via ELISA. Furthermore, we used the ICA to track Ag-specific plasmablast responses in HIV-vaccine recipients over a period of 42 d and performed a head-to-head comparison with a conventional B cell ELISpot. Results were highly comparable, highlighting that this assay is a viable alternative for monitoring Ag-specific plasmablast responses at early time points after infection or vaccination. The ICA provides important added benefits in that phenotypic information can be obtained from the identified Ag-specific cells that can then be captured for downstream applications such as B cell sequencing and/or Ab cloning.We envisage the ICA as being a useful tool in Ab repertoire analysis for future clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Antigen-Antibody Reactions", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Blood Preservation", "Cell Separation", "Cryopreservation", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Follow-Up Studies", "HEK293 Cells", "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens", "Hepatitis B Vaccines", "HIV Antibodies", "Humans", "Peptide Fragments", "Plasma Cells", "Tetanus Toxin", "Tetanus Toxoid", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038572829", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57198291900": {"Name": "Pinder C.", "AuthorID": "57198291900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Wright-Fleming Building"}, "57194410763": {"Name": "Kratochvil S.", "AuthorID": "57194410763", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Wright-Fleming Building"}, "57194419986": {"Name": "Cizmeci D.", "AuthorID": "57194419986", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Wright-Fleming Building"}, "56744480800": {"Name": "Muir L.", "AuthorID": "56744480800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Wright-Fleming Building"}, "7003670939": {"Name": "Shattock R.", "AuthorID": "7003670939", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Wright-Fleming Building"}, "35936124200": {"Name": "McKay P.", "AuthorID": "35936124200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Wright-Fleming Building"}, "57199994866": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "57199994866", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Flow Cytometry Core Facility, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}}}
