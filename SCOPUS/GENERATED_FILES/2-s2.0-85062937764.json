This research studied in depth the mode switching behavior from a range of non-car modes to the car, to identify opportunities for policy intervention to hold back such changes in habit toward car usage. Retrospective commute mode choice and various life course event data over four observation periods were collected. A mixed binary logit regression model was developed to study mode switching behavior from car to non-car modes, followed by the development of a set of \u201cmirror models\u201d (also mixed binary logit) that evaluated mode switches from non-car modes to the car. By observing their distinct reactions to life course events, it was found that users of different types of non-car modes display distinct mode switching behavior, especially in relation to getting married, having their first child and in response to different degrees of commute distance change. A thorough discussion on the policy implications of these findings is provided.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binary logit", "Mirror model", "Mode choice", "Mode switches", "Mode-switching", "Observation Period", "Policy implications", "Policy intervention"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062937764", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57191520989": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57191520989", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Energy Institute"}, "49861504700": {"Name": "Kamargianni M.", "AuthorID": "49861504700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Energy Institute"}}}
