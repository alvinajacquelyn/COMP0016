Disasters \u00a9 Overseas Development Institute, 2019Numerous resilience measurement frameworks for climate programmes have emerged over the past decade to operationalise the concept and aggregate results within and between programmes. Proxies of resilience, including subjective measures using perception data, have been proposed to measure resilience, but there is limited evidence on their validity and use for policy and practice. This article draws on research on the Decentralising Climate Funds project of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters programme, which supports communities in Mali and Senegal to improve climate resilience through locally controlled adaptation funds. It explores attributes of resilience from this bottom-up perspective to assess its predictors and alignment with food security, as a proxy of well-being. We find different patterns when comparing resilience and the well-being proxy, illustrating that the interplay between the two is still unclear. Results also point to the importance of contextualising resilience, raising implications for aggregating results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate adaptation", "food security", "resilience", "Sahel", "subjective indicators", "well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climate Change", "Disaster Planning", "Humans", "Internationality", "Mali", "Perception", "Resilience, Psychological", "Senegal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063878179", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56900920500": {"Name": "Beauchamp E.", "AuthorID": "56900920500", "AffiliationID": "60092016", "AffiliationName": "Researcher (Climate and Environment), Strategy and Learning Group, International Institute for Environment and Development"}, "57208124939": {"Name": "Abdella J.", "AuthorID": "57208124939", "AffiliationID": "117083661", "AffiliationName": "Director of Climate Resilient Development, Near East Foundation"}, "56054306700": {"Name": "Fisher S.", "AuthorID": "56054306700", "AffiliationID": "60092016", "AffiliationName": "Climate Change, International Institute for Environment and Development"}, "6602836025": {"Name": "McPeak J.", "AuthorID": "6602836025", "AffiliationID": "60118347, 60030551", "AffiliationName": "Public Administration and International Affairs, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University"}, "57208128661": {"Name": "Patnaik H.", "AuthorID": "57208128661", "AffiliationID": "60118347, 60030551", "AffiliationName": "Public Administration and International Affairs, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University"}, "57208134485": {"Name": "Koulibaly P.", "AuthorID": "57208134485", "AffiliationID": "122383117", "AffiliationName": "Head of Monitoring and Evaluation and Knowledge Management, IED (Innovation Environnement D\u00e9veloppement) Afrique"}, "6602795652": {"Name": "Ciss\u00e9 D.", "AuthorID": "6602795652", "AffiliationID": "122382660", "AffiliationName": "Head of Monitoring and Evaluation and Knowledge Management, Near East Foundation"}, "57208128392": {"Name": "Tour\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "57208128392", "AffiliationID": "122383545", "AffiliationName": "DCF Policy Officer, IED (Innovation Environnement D\u00e9veloppement) Afrique"}, "57208128582": {"Name": "Bocoum A.", "AuthorID": "57208128582", "AffiliationID": "122382660", "AffiliationName": "Programme Lead, Decentralising Climate Funds, Near East Foundation"}, "57208124050": {"Name": "Ndao M.", "AuthorID": "57208124050", "AffiliationID": "122383507", "AffiliationName": "Programme Lead, Decentralising Climate Funds, IED Afrique"}, "57208124646": {"Name": "Deme Y.", "AuthorID": "57208124646", "AffiliationID": "122382660", "AffiliationName": "Mali Country Director, Near East Foundation"}, "15727685600": {"Name": "Gueye B.", "AuthorID": "15727685600", "AffiliationID": "122382898", "AffiliationName": "Senegal Country Director, IED Afrique"}}}
