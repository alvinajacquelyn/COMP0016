However, the AAEM is reported to suffer from increased instability within the alkaline media (degradation) via a number of routes, including nucleophilic elimination when operated at temperatures above 60 \u00b0C, somewhat eliminating the kinetic advantage of operating at higher temperatures. Nonetheless, modelling studies have indicated that the membrane hydration could show improved resistance to alkaline instability and subsequent degradation when operated at elevated temperatures. This investigation uses the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to examine the thermal stability of a commercial AAEM as a function of humidity. The results show that hydration improves ionomer resistance to degradation, as the ions within the system (namely the OH\u2212 nucleophile and cationic headgroups) become less reactive. In-line mass spectrometry data confirms that the ionomer degrades during the elevated temperature excursions used in this study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fuel cells", "Hofmann elimination", "In-situ degradation", "QCM", "Thin film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline anion exchange membrane", "Elevated temperature", "Hofmann elimination", "Mass spectrometry data", "Non-precious metals", "Oxygen reduction reaction kinetics", "Situ degradation", "Solid polymer electrolytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012877783", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"56069704400": {"Name": "Bharath V.J.", "AuthorID": "56069704400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56110123700": {"Name": "Jervis R.", "AuthorID": "56110123700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "42061920200": {"Name": "Millichamp J.", "AuthorID": "42061920200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.P.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering, University College London"}, "55324237200": {"Name": "Mason T.", "AuthorID": "55324237200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56372219400": {"Name": "Tjaden B.", "AuthorID": "56372219400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57197860377": {"Name": "Brown R.J.C.", "AuthorID": "57197860377", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Division, National Physical Laboratory"}}}
