The aim of the therapy is to reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing a sense of safety and self-efficacy. The therapy is characterized by a person-centered approach to CBT, using individual tailoring to accommodate for cognitive deficits and other challenges. Three phases of therapy are described: (a) socialization to model (including overcoming barriers to participation), goal setting, and formulation; (b) application of cognitive and behavioral change techniques to address unhelpful autonomic reactions, \u201cstrategic\u201d reactions, \u201crules for living,\u201d and interpersonal aspects; and (c) consolidation and ending in the context of chronic, deteriorating illness. The approach prioritizes direct work with the person with dementia, with the involvement of a \u201csupportive other\u201d where available and when necessary. The protocol is designed for use by therapists with prior experience in CBT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "CBT", "cognitive-behavioral therapy", "dementia", "manual"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cognitive Therapy", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Self Efficacy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930728852", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35765796900": {"Name": "Sadek S.", "AuthorID": "35765796900", "AffiliationID": "115323111", "AffiliationName": "South Essex Partnership Foundation Trust"}, "53464449700": {"Name": "Schepers A.", "AuthorID": "53464449700", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
