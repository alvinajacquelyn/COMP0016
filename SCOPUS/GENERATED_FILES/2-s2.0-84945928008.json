It is applied to a research question in urban geography, namely how well a simple and generic model of a system of cities can reproduce the evolution of Soviet urbanisation. We compared the ability of two models with different levels of complexity to satisfy goals at two levels. The macro-goal is to simulate the evolution of the system\u2019s hierarchical structure. The micro-goal is to simulate its micro-dynamics in a realistic way. The evaluation of the models is based on empirical data through a calibration that includes sensitivity analysis using genetic algorithms and distributed computing. We show that a simple model of spatial interactions cannot fully reproduce the observed evolution of Soviet urbanisation from 1959 to 1989. A better fit was achieved when the model\u2019s structure was complexified with two mechanisms. Our evaluation goals were assessed through intensive sensitivity analysis. The complexified model allowed us to simulate the evolution of the Soviet urban hierarchy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABM", "Evaluation", "Former soviet union", "Incremental", "Model-building", "System of cities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945928008", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"54392627400": {"Name": "Cottineau C.", "AuthorID": "54392627400", "AffiliationID": "60021260", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne"}, "57213946189": {"Name": "Chapron P.", "AuthorID": "57213946189", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "University of Lausanne"}, "35278708700": {"Name": "Reuillon R.", "AuthorID": "35278708700", "AffiliationID": "60123629, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS G\u00e9ographie-cit\u00e9s and Complex Systems Institute Paris"}}}
