Uptake of evidence-based guidelines in primary care is inconsistent, resulting in variation in the detection and management of CKD. Initial assessment: Routinely collected general practice data in one UK region suggested a CKD prevalence of 4.1%, compared with an estimated national prevalence of 8.5%. Of patients on CKD registers, ~30% were estimated to have suboptimal management according to Public Health Observatory analyses. Choice of solution: An evidence-based framework for implementation was developed. This informed the design of an improvement collaborative to work with a sample of 30 general practices. Implementation: A two-phase collaborativewas implemented between September 2009 and March 2012. Key elements of the intervention included learning events, improvement targets, Plan-Do- Study-Act cycles, benchmarking of audit data, facilitator support and staff time reimbursement. Evaluation: Outcomes were evaluated against two indicators: number of patients with CKD on practice registers; percentage of patients achieving evidence-based blood pressure (BP) targets, as amarker for CKD care. In Phase 1, recorded prevalence of CKD in collaborative practices increased ~2-fold more than that in comparator local practices; in Phase 2, this increased to 4-fold, indicating improved case identification. Management of BP according to guideline recommendations also improved. Lessons learned: An improvement collaborative with tailored facilitation support appears to promote the uptake of evidence-based guidance on the identification and management of CKD in primary care. A controlled evaluation study is needed to rigorously evaluate the impact of this promising improvement intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Evidence-based guidance", "Implementation", "Improvement collaborative", "Primary care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benchmarking", "Blood Pressure", "Disease Management", "Guideline Adherence", "Humans", "Insurance, Health, Reimbursement", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Prevalence", "Primary Health Care", "Program Evaluation", "Quality Improvement", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924536917", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7102703861": {"Name": "Harvey G.", "AuthorID": "7102703861", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60189792", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Adelaide"}, "37112905200": {"Name": "Oliver K.", "AuthorID": "37112905200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department for Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (UCL STEaPP), University College London"}, "57197299526": {"Name": "Humphreys J.", "AuthorID": "57197299526", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC for Greater Manchester, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55597320600": {"Name": "Rothwell K.", "AuthorID": "55597320600", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC for Greater Manchester, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "10539083600": {"Name": "Hegarty J.", "AuthorID": "10539083600", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Renal Department, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
