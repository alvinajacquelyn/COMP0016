Math achievement was measured by three sectional examinations in a semester, NS was indicated by an approximate numerosity system task, and WM was assessed by a battery of four tasks. Developmental trends in both WM and NS task scores were observed. Memory updating (MU) in the WM tasks was found to be dominant in predicting math achievement in correlation and regression analyses. A similar pattern was observed for separate analyses across grade levels, except that in grade 7 a significant unique contribution of NS to math was observed after taking MU into account. The findings suggest that WM ability (especially that used in MU task) had greater influence on math achievement than NS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Approximate numerosity system", "Mathematics achievement", "Memory updating task", "Number sense", "Working memory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009921598", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57154867400": {"Name": "Yen M.", "AuthorID": "57154867400", "AffiliationID": "60022637", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Science Education, National Taiwan Normal University"}, "57192998508": {"Name": "Han C.", "AuthorID": "57192998508", "AffiliationID": "60027018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National Chengchi University"}, "57192996965": {"Name": "Yang T.", "AuthorID": "57192996965", "AffiliationID": "60027018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National Chengchi University"}, "7005729624": {"Name": "Butterworth B.", "AuthorID": "7005729624", "AffiliationID": "60027018", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Mind, Brain, and Learning, National Chengchi University"}, "56248696700": {"Name": "Yen N.", "AuthorID": "56248696700", "AffiliationID": "60027018", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Mind, Brain, and Learning, National Chengchi University"}, "57192999581": {"Name": "Yu P.", "AuthorID": "57192999581", "AffiliationID": "117990933", "AffiliationName": "Tainan Municipal Yong-Ren Senior High School"}, "55809809900": {"Name": "Didino D.", "AuthorID": "55809809900", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}}}
