Aim: To identify priorities for health education research. Methods: A three-stage sequential mixed methods study was conducted. Priorities for health education research were identified through a qualitative survey with 104 students, patients, academics, and clinicians across five health sciences and 12 professions (stage 1). These findings were analyzed using framework analysis and transposed into a quantitative survey whereby 780 stakeholders rated and ranked the identified priorities. Descriptive statistics identified priorities, exploratory factor analysis grouped priorities and differences between stakeholders were determined using Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (stage 2). Six individual or group interviews with 16 participants (stage 3) further explicated the results from previous stages. Results: Of 30 priorities identified, the top were: how best to ensure students develop the required skills for work; how to promote resiliency and well-being in students; and ensuring the curriculum prepares students for work. For the majority of priorities, no significant differences were found between different stakeholder groups. Conclusions: These findings will be used to inform health educational research strategy both locally and nationally. Further research should explore if setting priorities can be translated effectively into education research policy and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Australia", "Clinical Competence", "Female", "Health Education", "Health Priorities", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Research", "Students, Health Occupations", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066792957", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"19337309600": {"Name": "Palermo C.", "AuthorID": "19337309600", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash Centre for Scholarship in Health Education, Monash University"}, "56539538500": {"Name": "King O.", "AuthorID": "56539538500", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash Centre for Scholarship in Health Education, Monash University"}, "7102984609": {"Name": "Brock T.", "AuthorID": "7102984609", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}, "35228602300": {"Name": "Brown T.", "AuthorID": "35228602300", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "55798607200": {"Name": "Crampton P.", "AuthorID": "55798607200", "AffiliationID": "60107756", "AffiliationName": "Health Professions Education Unit, Hull York Medical School"}, "36240708500": {"Name": "Hall H.", "AuthorID": "36240708500", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Nursing and Midwifery, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "7003722421": {"Name": "Macaulay J.", "AuthorID": "7003722421", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "23489367400": {"Name": "Morphet J.", "AuthorID": "23489367400", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Nursing and Midwifery, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "13905372200": {"Name": "Mundy M.", "AuthorID": "13905372200", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "54797326600": {"Name": "Oliaro L.", "AuthorID": "54797326600", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Work, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "54995802400": {"Name": "Paynter S.", "AuthorID": "54995802400", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "23010967300": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "23010967300", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Emergency Health and Paramedic Practice, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "35219495700": {"Name": "Wright C.", "AuthorID": "35219495700", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging & Radiation Sciences, Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "56265450600": {"Name": "E.
