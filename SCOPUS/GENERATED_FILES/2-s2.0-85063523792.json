We investigate how awards are perceived and impact upon recipients and non-recipients and propose that the potential of teaching awards is mediated by career stage, focus and performance. We also make recommendations for how teaching awards can contribute to a culture of teaching enhancement beyond the recognition of individual practice. In this way, we make a contribution by showing how teaching awards can be designed and used to recognize teaching practice while limiting their dysfunctional outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["motivation", "organizational culture", "reward and recognition", "Teaching awards", "teaching quality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063523792", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"35225253200": {"Name": "Seppala N.", "AuthorID": "35225253200", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "37034918300": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "37034918300", "AffiliationID": "60160427, 60026830", "AffiliationName": "Lincoln International Business School, University of Lincoln"}}}
