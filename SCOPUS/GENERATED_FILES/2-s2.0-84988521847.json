It is crucial to maximise individual benefit, whilst ensuring adequate assessment of key study end-points. We assessed prognostic factors of survival in paediatric phase I trials, including two predictive scores validated in adult oncology: the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) scores. Methods Data of patients with solid tumours aged <18 years at enrolment in their first dose-finding trial between 2000 and 2014 at eight centres of the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer European consortium were collected. Survival distributions were compared using log-rank test and Cox regression analyses. Results Overall, 248 patients were evaluated: median age, 11.2 years (range 1.0\u201317.9); 46% had central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 54% extra-CNS tumours. Complete responses were observed in 2.1%, partial responses in 7.2% and stable disease in 25.9%. Median overall survival (OS) was 6.3 months (95% confidence interval, 5.2\u20137.4). Lansky/Karnofsky \u226480%, no school/work attendance, elevated creatinine and RMH score \u22651 correlated with worse OS in the multivariate analysis. The RMH and MDACC scores correlated with OS in adolescents (12\u201317 years), p = 0.002, but not in children (2\u201311 years). Conclusions Performance status of 90\u2013100% and school/work attendance at enrolment are strong indicators of longer OS in paediatric phase I trials. Adult predictive scores correlate with survival in adolescents. These findings provide a useful orientation about potential prognosis and could lead in the future to more paediatric-adapted eligibility criteria in early-phase trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Children", "Dose-finding trial", "Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer", "Phase I trial", "Prognostic factor", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic", "Employment", "Ependymoma", "Europe", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Medulloblastoma", "Multivariate Analysis", "Neoplasms", "Neuroblastoma", "Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive", "Osteosarcoma", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Retrospective Studies", "Rhabdomyosarcoma", "Sarcoma", "Sarcoma, Ewing", "Schools", "Survival Rate", "Therapies, Investigational"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988521847", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56548533000": {"Name": "Carceller F.", "AuthorID": "56548533000", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "16744335600": {"Name": "Marshall L.V.", "AuthorID": "16744335600", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7401994312": {"Name": "Pearson A.D.J.", "AuthorID": "7401994312", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7003887545": {"Name": "Bautista F.J.", "AuthorID": "7003887545", "AffiliationID": "60026312", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Paediatric Oncology Department, Hospital Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas"}, "57191264997": {"Name": "Hladun-\u00c1lvaro R.", "AuthorID": "57191264997", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Vall d'Hebron Hospital"}, "6603067617": {"Name": "Geoerger B.", "AuthorID": "6603067617", "AffiliationID": "60106080, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud"}, "31367505400": {"Name": "Moreno L.", "AuthorID": "31367505400", "AffiliationID": "60026312", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Paediatric Oncology Department, Hospital Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas"}, "56062239100": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez I.", "AuthorID": "56062239100", "AffiliationID": "60030640", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric, Adolescents and Young Adults Oncology, Institut Curie"}, "8100913600": {"Name": "Aerts I.", "AuthorID": "8100913600", "AffiliationID": "60030640", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric, Adolescents and Young Adults Oncology, Institut Curie"}, "7006535031": {"Name": "Doz F.", "AuthorID": "7006535031", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "36672825000": {"Name": "Giraud C.", "AuthorID": "36672825000", "AffiliationID": "112646072", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neuro-Oncology, Institut H\u00e9matologique et d'Oncologie P\u00e9diatrique"}, "7006004483": {"Name": "Frappaz D.", "AuthorID": "7006004483", "AffiliationID": "112646072", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neuro-Oncology, Institut H\u00e9matologique et d'Oncologie P\u00e9diatrique"}, "54796418700": {"Name": "Bergamaschi L.", "AuthorID": "54796418700", "AffiliationID": "60006583", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori"}, "7102125700": {"Name": "Casanova M.", "AuthorID": "7102125700", "AffiliationID": "60006583", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori"}, "15123804500": {"Name": "Dandapani M.", "AuthorID": "15123804500", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "57202953721": {"Name": "Morland B.", "AuthorID": "57202953721", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.R.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005105026": {"Name": "Vassal G.", "AuthorID": "7005105026", "AffiliationID": "60106080, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud"}}}
