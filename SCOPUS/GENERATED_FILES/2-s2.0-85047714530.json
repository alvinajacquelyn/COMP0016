Making appropriate choices is essential to successful communication. The process of choice making, however, has not been a core concern of formal linguistics, which, instead, is more interested in delineating the general principles governing the structures of languages. Psycholinguists are interested in choice making. But they see it primarily or even solely as a cognitive process, and tend to be concerned more with the neural networks or individual experiences that are responsible for making linguistic choices. In this context, the notion of multi-competence (MC) has important implications for the way we investigate the process of choice making by language users. It brings together what has traditionally been conceptualised separately as sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic approaches, and broadens the scope of choice to include multimodality and polysemiotic systems. In this chapter I will focus on three of the central themes of sociolinguistics, namely language variation, language and social disadvantage, and multilingual and intercultural communication, and present them from an MC perspective. Whilst focusing on the implications of MC for sociolinguistics, I will point out the connections between sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics and other approaches. I will also discuss the implications of recent extensions of MC to the community, or collective MC. To begin with, it would be useful to review three key concepts: communicative competence, symbolic competence and MC. The first two are frequently used in sociolinguistics. The connections between them and MC serve as a good starting point for a discussion of the consequences of MC for sociolinguistics. Communicative competence, symbolic competence and multi-competence Communicative competence (CC) is central to the sociolinguistic enterprise, which is built on the premise that language is a social practice. In addition to knowing how to form a grammatically correct sentence, one needs to know, in order to communicate successfully through language, the social roles and status of the interlocutors, the background knowledge interlocutors share, and what interlocutors are trying to accomplish in their interaction. This kind of knowledge is captured in the notion of CC, coined by the anthropological linguist Dell Hymes (1966) in reaction to the perceived inadequacy of Chomsky\u2019s (1965) distinction between competence and performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047714530", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7402951126": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "7402951126", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
