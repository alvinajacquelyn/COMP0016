In contrast, this paper investigates the performance of wireless power transfer based two-hop cooperative relaying systems in indoor channels characterized by log-normal fading. Specifically, two EH protocols are considered here, namely, time switching relaying (TSR) and power splitting relaying (PSR). Our findings include accurate analytical expressions for the ergodic capacity and ergodic outage probability for the two aforementioned protocols. Monte Carlo simulations are used throughout to confirm the accuracy of our analysis. The results show that increasing the channel variance will always provide better ergodic capacity performance. It is also shown that a good selection of the EH time in the TSR protocol, and the power splitting factor in the PTS protocol, is the key to achieve the best system performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AF relaying", "energy-harvesting (EH)", "ergodic capacity", "log-normal fading", "wireless power transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["AF relaying", "Analytical expressions", "Cooperative relaying", "Ergodic capacity", "Future wireless networks", "Log-normal fading", "Two-hop relay networks", "Wireless power transfer"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981303122", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55884933100": {"Name": "Rabie K.M.", "AuthorID": "55884933100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "57044158800": {"Name": "Salem A.", "AuthorID": "57044158800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "23007808700": {"Name": "Alsusa E.", "AuthorID": "23007808700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "35570711700": {"Name": "Alouini M.S.", "AuthorID": "35570711700", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}}}
