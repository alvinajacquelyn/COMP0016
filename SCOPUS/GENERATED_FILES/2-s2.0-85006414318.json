We compared the rate of corrosion and rate of wear at the trunnion/head taper junction in two groups of retrieved hips; those with mixed manufacturers (MM) and those from the same manufacturer (SM). Materials and Methods We identified 151 retrieved hips with large-diameter cobalt-chromium heads; 51 of two designs that had been paired with stems from different manufacturers (MM) and 100 of seven designs paired with stems from the same manufacturer (SM). We determined the severity of corrosion with the Goldberg corrosion score and the volume of material loss at the head/stem junction. We used multivariable statistical analysis to determine if there was a significant difference between the two groups. Results We found no significant difference in the corrosion scores of the two groups. The median rate of material loss at the head/stem junction for the MM and SM groups were 0.39 mm3/ year (0.00 to 4.73) and 0.46 mm3/year (0.00 to 6.71) respectively; this difference was not significant after controlling for confounding factors (p = 0.06). Conclusion The use of stems with heads of another manufacturer does not appear to affect the amount of metal lost from the surfaces between these two components at total hip arthroplasty. Other surgical, implant and patient factors should be considered when determining the mechanisms of failure of large diameter metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Chromium", "Chromium Alloys", "Cobalt", "Corrosion", "Female", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Male", "Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006414318", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55982205200": {"Name": "Whittaker R.K.", "AuthorID": "55982205200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6507418782": {"Name": "Meswania J.M.", "AuthorID": "6507418782", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "26532304500": {"Name": "Berber R.", "AuthorID": "26532304500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57206307303": {"Name": "Blunn G.W.", "AuthorID": "57206307303", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), Biomedical Engineering, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
