We show that loss of TET2-induced PI3K activation and -increased proliferation is rescued by targeting the p110\u03b1/\u03b4 subunits of PI3K. RNA-Seq revealed a hyperactive c-Myc signature in Tet2-/- cells, which is normalized by inhibiting PI3K signaling. Loss of TET2 impairs the maturation of myeloid lineage-derived mast cells by dysregulating the expression of Mitf and Cebpa, which is restored by low-dose ascorbic acid and 5-azacytidine. Utilizing a mouse model in which the loss of TET2 precedes the expression of oncogenic Kit, similar to the human disease, results in the development of a non-mast cell lineage neoplasm (AHNMD), which is responsive to PI3K inhibition. Thus, therapeutic approaches involving hypomethylating agents, ascorbic acid, and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors are likely to be useful for treating patients with TET2 and KIT mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Hematology", "Hematopoietic stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057975637", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24279897200": {"Name": "Palam L.R.", "AuthorID": "24279897200", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "8623915100": {"Name": "Mali R.S.", "AuthorID": "8623915100", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "24338827100": {"Name": "Ramdas B.", "AuthorID": "24338827100", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "6507203715": {"Name": "Paczesny S.", "AuthorID": "6507203715", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "7102877310": {"Name": "Kapur R.", "AuthorID": "7102877310", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "57216903016": {"Name": "Srivatsan S.N.", "AuthorID": "57216903016", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University & Purdue University"}, "7801631748": {"Name": "Janga S.C.", "AuthorID": "7801631748", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "16445211800": {"Name": "Visconte V.", "AuthorID": "16445211800", "AffiliationID": "60032732, 60021160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic"}, "14424616500": {"Name": "Tiu R.V.", "AuthorID": "14424616500", "AffiliationID": "60032732, 60021160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "6603006953": {"Name": "Roers A.", "AuthorID": "6603006953", "AffiliationID": "119181455", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunology"}, "12445755500": {"Name": "Gerbaulet A.", "AuthorID": "12445755500", "AffiliationID": "119181455", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunology"}, "35308080600": {"Name": "Xu M.", "AuthorID": "35308080600", "AffiliationID": "60011479, 60021519", "AffiliationName": "Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Miami School of Medicine"}, "6701732992": {"Name": "Takemoto C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701732992", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University"}}}
