All Rights Reserved.Context: The effects of physical activity (PA) on improvement of glycemia may differ between prediabetic individuals defined by oral glucose tolerance test vs glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Objective: We studied the association between PA and improvement of glycemia in individuals with prediabetes defined by glucose vs HbA1c criteria. Design, Setting, and Participants: From the Whitehall II study, 957 participants with prediabetes defined by isolated impaired fasting glucose (i-IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (i-IGT), or both and 457 with prediabetes defined by HbA1c were included. Main Outcome Measures: The associations of PA with concomitant changes in glucose-related outcomes during 5 years of follow-up were analyzed. A recursive partitioning analysis was performed to study heterogeneity in the association between baseline PA and the probability of reversion to normoglycemia. Results: After 5 years of follow-up, 405 (42%) individuals with glucose-defined prediabetes reverted to normal glucose tolerance (NGT). A 5-year increase in moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA was associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity and b-cell function, but PA was not generally associated with reversion to NGT. Only among women $50 years with i-IFG or i-IGT, higher amounts of PA were associated with higher probability of reversion to NGT. In HbA1c-defined prediabetes, only 20 individuals (4.4%) reverted to normoglycemia, and PA was not associated with improvement in glycemic markers. Conclusions: PA may be particularly important for reversion to normoglycemia among older women with i-IFG or i-IGT. Individuals with prediabetes identified by HbA1c have a low probability of reversion to normoglycemia, and their changes in glycemia are not related to PA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Cohort Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glucose Intolerance", "Glucose Tolerance Test", "Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prediabetic State"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032490918", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57197805045": {"Name": "Witte D.R.", "AuthorID": "57197805045", "AffiliationID": "114114000", "AffiliationName": "Danish Diabetes Academy"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.J.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k A.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "56954345000": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen M.E.", "AuthorID": "56954345000", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen"}, "57203258140": {"Name": "Ekelund U.", "AuthorID": "57203258140", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "8577664900": {"Name": "F\u00e6rch K.", "AuthorID": "8577664900", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen"}, "13404153300": {"Name": "Vistisen D.", "AuthorID": "13404153300", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen"}}}
