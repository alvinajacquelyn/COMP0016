Amino-acid-induced activation of mammalian TORC1 is initiated by its recruitment to the RagA/B-RagC/D GTPase heterodimer, which is anchored to lysosomal membranes through the Ragulator complex. We have identified in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe a Ragulator-like complex that tethers the Gtr1-Gtr2 Rag heterodimer to the membranes of vacuoles, the lysosome equivalent in yeasts. Unexpectedly, the Ragulator-Rag complex is not required for the vacuolar targeting of TORC1, but the complex plays a crucial role in attenuating TORC1 activity independently of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex, a known negative regulator of TORC1 signaling. The GATOR1 complex, which functions as Gtr1 GAP, is essential for the TORC1 attenuation by the Ragulator-Rag complex, suggesting that Gtr1GDP-Gtr2 on vacuolar membranes moderates TORC1 signaling for optimal cellular response to nutrients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Transport", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Vacuoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040945699", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57200338301": {"Name": "Chia K.H.", "AuthorID": "57200338301", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology"}, "7404415138": {"Name": "Fukuda T.", "AuthorID": "7404415138", "AffiliationID": "60176099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Physiology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University"}, "57200339492": {"Name": "Sofyantoro F.", "AuthorID": "57200339492", "AffiliationID": "60069380", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Physiology, Faculty of Biology, Universitas Gadjah Mada"}, "57217402285": {"Name": "Matsuda T.", "AuthorID": "57217402285", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology"}, "57203161100": {"Name": "Amai T.", "AuthorID": "57203161100", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology"}, "55672175000": {"Name": "Shiozaki K.", "AuthorID": "55672175000", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Davis"}}}
