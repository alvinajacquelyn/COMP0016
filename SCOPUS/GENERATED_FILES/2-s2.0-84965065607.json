The optimization of the EI experimental setup for a given application is therefore essential, in order to take full advantage of the capabilities of the technique. In this work, we analyze the dependence of the angular sensitivity, spatial resolution and dose delivered to the sample upon the various experimental parameters, and describe possible strategies to optimize them. The obtained results will be important for the design of future EI experimental setups, in particular enabling their tailoring to specific applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Angular sensitivity", "Experimental parameters", "Spatial resolution", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965065607", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55577198300": {"Name": "Millard T.", "AuthorID": "55577198300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
