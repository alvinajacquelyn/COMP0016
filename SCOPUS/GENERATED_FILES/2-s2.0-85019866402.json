Layered, well-organized structure of water in the interface region was clearly observed within 6.5 \u00c5 of the surfaces. The first-hydration layer molecules adsorbed to unsaturated surface Ti atoms undergo spontaneous dissociation leading, rather controversially, to full coverage of O2c/Ob by H+ and partial coverage of Ti5c by OH-. Expected large variations of intrinsic electric field on the interfaces, and drop of electrostatic potential, were detected. Interfacial water was found to be heavily confined with a self-diffusion constant of 2 orders of magnitude lower than 2.28 \u00d7 10-9 m2/s measured in the bulk water region. Moreover, the rotational movement of adsorbed water molecules was found to be considerably hindered as well. On the other hand, the calculated hydrogen-bond lifetime on the interface was shorter than in bulk water for both surface types. Finally, the IR spectra obtained from collective-water-dipole variations in the interfacial region revealed stronger effects on stretching vibrations on anatase (101) than on rutile (110); however, description of liquid-water bond-stretching vibrations generally suffers from lack of accuracy in the applied reactive potential.
