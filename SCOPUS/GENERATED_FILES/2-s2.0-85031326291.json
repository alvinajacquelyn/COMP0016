All rights reserved.Purpose This retrospective comparative case series aims to determine whether patient ethnicity (White versus South Asian versus Black) is related to the outcome of surgical treatment for traction complications of severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).SettingMoorfields Eye Hospital London, UK.MethodsAll patients who underwent vitrectomy with, delamination and/or segmentation for PDR over a 5-year period (2009-2014) were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into White, South Asian or Black groups, and their age, gender, HbA1C and type of diabetes were recorded. A total of 484 patients (253 White, 117 South Asian, 114 Black) were included. Twenty-one patients were excluded due to inadequate documentation.OutcomesLogMAR Visual acuity (converted from Snellen) (VA), was recorded pre-operatively and \u223c6 months post surgery (range 5-8 months). Surgical outcome was classified according to the type and duration of tamponade required post-operatively.ResultsPre-operative VA and HbA1C values were similar across all three ethnic groups (P=0.64 and 0.569, respectively). Change in VA (mean\u00b1SD) was 0.41\u00b10.78, 0.14\u00b10.76 and '0.26\u00b10.57 in White, South Asian and Black patient groups respectively (P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that post-op VA was significantly related to race and pre-op VA only (both P<0.001). The Black patient group were more likely to require silicone oil tamponade (P<0.001) and long-term retention of silicone oil (P<0.001) than the White and South Asian patient groups.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that Black patients on average lose vision following delamination surgery for traction complications of PDR while White and South Asian patients gain vision. The same group is also at higher risk of retaining silicone more than 6 months after surgery. This difference remains even when corrected for glycaemic control. The higher risk of visual loss and long-term retention of silicone oil in black patients requires further investigation. If these results are confirmed, surgeons should consider their patients' ethnicity before proceeding with surgical treatment of diabetic tractional detachment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Aged", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Blindness", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Disease Progression", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Visual Acuity", "Vitrectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031326291", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"37117425300": {"Name": "Mastropasqua R.", "AuthorID": "37117425300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal, Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204025330": {"Name": "Luo Y.H.L.", "AuthorID": "57204025330", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal, Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701376895": {"Name": "Da Cruz L.", "AuthorID": "6701376895", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57204025536": {"Name": "Cheah Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57204025536", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetic Medicine, King's College Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8664391300": {"Name": "Lewis J.J.", "AuthorID": "8664391300", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
