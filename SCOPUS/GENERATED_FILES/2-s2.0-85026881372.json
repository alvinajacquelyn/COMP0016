Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.Purpose: To review the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peel, and gas tamponade in the management of traumatic paediatric macular holes. Methods: Retrospective case series of children undergoing vitrectomy, ILM peel, and gas tamponade for traumatic macular hole between March 2007 and July 2014. Main outcome measures were postoperative visual acuity at 3 and 12 months, anatomic closure rate, and surgical complications. Results: Anatomic macular hole closure was achieved in 12 (92.3%) of 13 cases. Mean preoperative logMAR visual acuity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.65-1.17) with improvement postoperatively to 0.54 (95% CI 0.43-0.64) at 3 months (p = 0.002) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.39-0.60) at 12 months (p = 0.002). There were no perioperative complications. Conclusion: Pars plana vitrectomy and ILM peel is an effective management option for paediatric macular holes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Macular hole", "Paediatric ophthalmology", "Trauma", "Vitrectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Basement Membrane", "Child", "Endotamponade", "Eye Injuries", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Retinal Perforations", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Vitrectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026881372", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"56478557400": {"Name": "Brennan N.", "AuthorID": "56478557400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57205987768": {"Name": "Khawaja A.P.", "AuthorID": "57205987768", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56616158900": {"Name": "Georgakarakos N.", "AuthorID": "56616158900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005485958": {"Name": "Ezra E.", "AuthorID": "7005485958", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55574842900": {"Name": "Reekie I.", "AuthorID": "55574842900", "AffiliationID": "60000228", "AffiliationName": "Hairmyres Hospital"}}}
