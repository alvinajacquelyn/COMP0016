This lift-off is followed by a return to the ground or by a flyaway in the sense of continued departure from the ground. Related phenomena arise in the lift-off of an air vehicle from, effectively, moving ground. The present investigation seeks fairly precise mechanistic conditions under which lift-off and subsequent return or fly-away occur for a thin body or more generally for any thin gap of fluid between a body and the ground. Nonlinear fluid\u2013solid interaction takes place in which the motion of the body and the surrounding fluid affect each other. Small-time analysis on lift-off and a numerical study are presented, followed by large-time analysis showing a critical flow speed for fly-away for any shape of the body. The changes in ground effect, from being dominant during lift-off to diminishing in fly-away, are explored together with relevant applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analysis", "Body", "Fluid", "Granular media", "Interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis", "Body", "Critical flow", "Granular media", "Horizontal flows", "Interaction", "Non-linear fluids", "Time analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058291248", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191578659": {"Name": "Balta S.", "AuthorID": "57191578659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57203583662": {"Name": "Smith F.T.", "AuthorID": "57203583662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
