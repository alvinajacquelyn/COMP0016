When developing SDN-based management architectures, it is of paramount importance to design a monitoring system that can provide frequent and consistent updates to heterogeneous management applications. For the monitoring functionality to scale according to the requirements of large-scale networks a distributed monitoring approach is required. In this paper we present a decentralized approach for resource monitoring in SDN, which is designed to support a wide range of measurement tasks and requirements in terms of monitoring rates and information granularity levels. Our solution leverages effective processing of the monitoring requests to reduce the consumption of limited resources, such as the control plane bandwidth of OpenFlow switches. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, our evaluation is based on a realistic and demanding use case, where a distributed management application coordinates a content distribution service in an ISP network.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Decentralized approach", "Decentralized monitoring", "Distributed management", "Distributed monitoring", "Information granularity", "Management applications", "Management architectures", "Software defined networking (SDN)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029412744", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57190031604": {"Name": "Tangari G.", "AuthorID": "57190031604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36184239500": {"Name": "Tuncer D.", "AuthorID": "36184239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14010012200": {"Name": "Charalambides M.", "AuthorID": "14010012200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
