In this vein, the current article examines the effect of an entrepreneurial culture on an employee's innovation output and explores three mechanisms by which this may be achieved. In a sample of 438 working adults, the relationship between entrepreneurial culture and innovation output was fully mediated by work engagement. Furthermore, entrepreneurial culture positively moderated the relationship between an individual's entrepreneurial personality and innovation output. These findings contribute new theoretical insights to the corporate entrepreneurship literature and have important practical implications for organizations aiming to become more entrepreneurial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entrepreneurial personality", "Innovation output", "Organizational culture", "Work engagement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057537754", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"24072779200": {"Name": "Ahmetoglu G.", "AuthorID": "24072779200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55450595700": {"Name": "Akhtar R.", "AuthorID": "55450595700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "24598393300": {"Name": "Tsivrikos D.", "AuthorID": "24598393300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "8244744300": {"Name": "Chamorro-Premuzic T.", "AuthorID": "8244744300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
