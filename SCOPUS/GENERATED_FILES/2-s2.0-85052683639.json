More specifically, the paper will use the examples from one completed study (Lloyd and Wilkinson, 2017) and one ongoing study (Hicks, in progress) to discuss and provide a detailed examination of the use, affordances and limitations of two research methods that centre upon participant-created photographs: photo-elicitation and photovoice. Demonstrating that the use of photographs helps to evoke and communicate complex meaning as well as to mediate between linguistic, temporal and spatial constraints, this study highlights the continuing need to develop research methods that privilege participants\u2019 understandings and perspectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Information literacy. information practices", "photo-elicitation", "photovoice", "visual research methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052683639", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"25627791300": {"Name": "Hicks A.", "AuthorID": "25627791300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "35614004000": {"Name": "Lloyd A.", "AuthorID": "35614004000", "AffiliationID": "60033091", "AffiliationName": "University of Boras"}}}
