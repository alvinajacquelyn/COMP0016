Objective: We aimed to quantify the extent of language deficits in this patient group. Methods:We assessed a cohort of patients with bvFTD (n = 24) in relation to patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA; n = 14), nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA; n = 18), and healthy age-matched individuals (n = 24) cross-sectionally and longitudinally using a comprehensive battery of language and general neuropsychological tests. Neuroanatomical associations of language performance were assessed using voxel-based morphometry of patients' brain magnetic resonance images. Results: Relative to healthy controls, and after accounting for nonverbal executive performance, patients with bvFTD showed deficits of noun and verb naming and singleword comprehension, diminished spontaneous propositional speech, and deterioration in naming performance over time.Within the bvFTD group, patients with MAPT mutations had more severe impairments of noun naming and singleword comprehension than patients with C9orf72 mutations. Overall the bvFTD group had less severe language deficits than patients with PPA, but showed a language profile thatwas qualitatively similar to svPPA. Neuroanatomical correlates of naming and word comprehension performance in bvFTD were identified predominantly in inferior frontal and antero-inferior temporal cortices within the dominant hemispheric language network. Conclusions: bvFTD is associated with a language profile including verbal semantic impairment that warrants further evaluation as a novel biomarker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia", "frontotemporal dementia", "primary progressive aphasia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aphasia, Primary Progressive", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cognition", "Comprehension", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Language", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Primary Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970923545", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57038112100": {"Name": "Hardy C.", "AuthorID": "57038112100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "45260985800": {"Name": "Buckley A.", "AuthorID": "45260985800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55362291000": {"Name": "Downey L.", "AuthorID": "55362291000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57195292229": {"Name": "Lehmann M.", "AuthorID": "57195292229", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102928876": {"Name": "Warrington E.", "AuthorID": "7102928876", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "42462737200": {"Name": "Zimmerer V.", "AuthorID": "42462737200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Cognition, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7005990265": {"Name": "Varley R.", "AuthorID": "7005990265", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Cognition, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
