Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Purpose To examine the cognitive risks of temporal lobe surgery in patients aged 50 years and older. Methods We analysed data from 55 patients who underwent temporal lobe surgery (26 left-sided:29 right sided) from 1988 to 2012 at our centre. Pre-surgical and one year post-operative memory and naming capacity were compared to data obtained from two younger cohorts; 185 aged 18-30 and 220 aged 31-49. Results Pre-operative memory impairments were most marked for the oldest cohort and were associated with a longer duration of epilepsy. Naming capacity improved with age and better performance was associated with a later age at epilepsy onset. Post-operative declines were largest in older patients, achieving statistical significance for verbal memory, naming and subjective ratings. Left temporal lobe resections carried the greatest risk of memory and naming decline. Cognitive outcomes were unrelated to seizure outcome, VIQ or mood. Conclusion Our findings indicate the cognitive risks of TLE surgery are greater for older patients. Cognitive outcomes need to be considered when assessing the efficacy of epilepsy surgery in older cohorts and pre-operative performance levels need to be taken into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive outcome", "Elderly", "Epilepsy surgery", "Memory", "Temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Memory Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Psychological Tests", "Risk", "Risk Factors", "Speech Perception", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930979552", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57203018933": {"Name": "Thompson P.J.", "AuthorID": "57203018933", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}, "7004038207": {"Name": "Baxendale S.A.", "AuthorID": "7004038207", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}}}
