This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (.Entropy maximising spatial interaction models have been widely exploited in a range of disciplines and applications: from trade and migration flows to the spread of riots and the understanding of spatial patterns in archaeological sites of interest. When embedded into a dynamic system and framed in the context of a retail model, the dynamics of centre growth poses an interesting mathematical problem, with bifurcations and phase changes, which may be addressed analytically. In this paper, we present some analysis of the continuous retail model and the corresponding discrete version, which yields insights into the effect of space on the evolving system, and an understanding of why certain retail centres are more successful than others. The slowly developing growths and the fast explosive growths that are of particular concern are explained in detail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["34A34", "34E10", "39A33", "91D10", "91D25", "asymptotics", "entropy", "Mathematical model", "urban evolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["34A34", "34E10", "39A33", "91D10", "91D25", "Asymptotics", "urban evolution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978080594", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55606560400": {"Name": "Fry H.M.", "AuthorID": "55606560400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "57203583662": {"Name": "Smith F.T.", "AuthorID": "57203583662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
