Through post thermal treatment to improve the electrical conductivity and porosity, the obtained materials showed excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity. The electrochemical performance was further enhanced after platinum impregnation, combining the advantages of small over-potential from platinum catalyst and high limiting current density from the carbon substrate. Therefore, we demonstrated here not only a novel and low cost hydrothermal synthesis route to achieve high-performing metal-free ORR catalyst or carbon substrate for additional metal catalyst, but also a general principle on how to develop metal nanoparticles/carbon hybrids for ORR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical conductivity", "Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction", "Electrochemical performance", "Limiting current density", "Oxygen reduction reaction", "Platinum catalysts", "Post thermal treatment", "Structure directing agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947996410", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55842663600": {"Name": "Alatalo S.M.", "AuthorID": "55842663600", "AffiliationID": "60014304", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Green Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Lappeenranta University of Technology"}, "7101751659": {"Name": "Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 M.", "AuthorID": "7101751659", "AffiliationID": "60014304", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Green Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Lappeenranta University of Technology"}, "57201704542": {"Name": "Qiu K.", "AuthorID": "57201704542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo X.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56879986700": {"Name": "Preuss K.", "AuthorID": "56879986700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56526971300": {"Name": "Marinovic A.", "AuthorID": "56526971300", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6506809216": {"Name": "Titirici M.M.", "AuthorID": "6506809216", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "9242237800": {"Name": "Sevilla M.", "AuthorID": "9242237800", "AffiliationID": "60022839", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional Del Carb\u00f3n (CSIC)"}}}
