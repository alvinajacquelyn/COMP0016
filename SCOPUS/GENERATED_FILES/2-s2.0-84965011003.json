Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA, Weinheim.The regioselective gold-catalysed hydration of propargylic alcohols to \u03b2-hydroxy ketones can be achieved by diverting the gold-catalysed Meyer-Schuster rearrangement through the addition of a protic additive with a pKa of 7-9 such as p-nitrophenol, boric acid or a boronic acid. This provides an interesting alternative to an aldol reaction when combined with the straightforward addition of an alkyne to an aldehyde or ketone. The gold-catalysed reaction of an electron-deficient, sterically hindered propargylic alcohol with a boronic acid led to the formation of an unusually stable cyclic boron enolate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aldol reaction", "alkynes", "boronic acids", "enolates", "gold"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965011003", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"40661820900": {"Name": "Pennell M.", "AuthorID": "40661820900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "56763438800": {"Name": "Gibson S.", "AuthorID": "56763438800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "57189072502": {"Name": "Kyle M.", "AuthorID": "57189072502", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "8216609200": {"Name": "Male L.", "AuthorID": "8216609200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "7103353954": {"Name": "Grainger R.", "AuthorID": "7103353954", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "36242400600": {"Name": "Turner P.", "AuthorID": "36242400600", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre"}}}
