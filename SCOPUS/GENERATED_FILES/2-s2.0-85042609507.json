The PESs were obtained using the open-shell partially spin-restricted coupled cluster approach with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [UCCSD(T)]. The augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence triple-zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis set was employed supplemented by mid-bond functions. Integral and differential cross sections for the rotational excitation in PO-He collisions were calculated using the new PES and compared with results in similar systems. Finally, our work presents the first hyperfine-resolved cross sections for this system that are needed for accurate modelling in astrophysical environments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042609507", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55943623100": {"Name": "Lique F.", "AuthorID": "55943623100", "AffiliationID": "60012570, 60008134, 60122732", "AffiliationName": "LOMC-UMR 6294, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 du Havre"}, "8866110100": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Serra I.", "AuthorID": "8866110100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Unit, School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003564783": {"Name": "Viti S.", "AuthorID": "7003564783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6507119410": {"Name": "Marinakis S.", "AuthorID": "6507119410", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
