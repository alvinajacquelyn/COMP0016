Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: The databases of the uveitis clinics of 4 tertiary medical centers in Israel and the UK were searched for all children treated for uveitic ME in the years 2005\u20132015. Data were collected from the medical records as follows: demographics, diagnosis, visual acuity, clinical and imaging findings, and treatment given specifically for ME. Findings at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were evaluated. Results: The cohort included 25 children (33 eyes) of mean age 8.5 \u00b1 3.4 years. The most common diagnosis was intermediate uveitis, in 14 children (7 idiopathic, 7 pars planitis). Uveitis was active at ME diagnosis in 28 eyes (84.8%). Median duration of follow-up was 48 months. Median time to resolution of ME was 6 months, with complete resolution in 25 eyes (75.8%) by 24 months. Baseline visual acuity was \u226520/40 in 8 eyes (24.2%), increased to 57.6% at 3 months (P <.0001), and remained stable thereafter. Treatment regimens included corticosteroids (systemically and/or locally), immunosuppression, and biologic therapies. No correlation was found between outcome and either structural characteristics of ME or specific treatment strategy. Conclusions: The prognosis of pediatric uveitic ME is favorable despite its chronic course. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to define differences among treatment regimens.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Factors", "Child", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fundus Oculi", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Macula Lutea", "Macular Edema", "Male", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Uveitis, Intermediate", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064681628", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57046061500": {"Name": "Eiger-Moscovich M.", "AuthorID": "57046061500", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "7402838329": {"Name": "Kramer M.", "AuthorID": "7402838329", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "8298099400": {"Name": "Habot-Wilner Z.", "AuthorID": "8298099400", "AffiliationID": "60008870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"}, "6603845289": {"Name": "Friling R.", "AuthorID": "6603845289", "AffiliationID": "60015234", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Ophthalmology Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel"}, "57201661157": {"Name": "Tomkins-Netzer O.", "AuthorID": "57201661157", "AffiliationID": "60022403, 60028807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Bnei Zion Medical Center, Israel Institute of Technology\u2014Technion"}, "57208406071": {"Name": "Kasb A.", "AuthorID": "57208406071", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London"}, "7004267639": {"Name": "Amer R.", "AuthorID": "7004267639", "AffiliationID": "60000087, 60072445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah University Hospital, Hadassah Medical School"}}}
