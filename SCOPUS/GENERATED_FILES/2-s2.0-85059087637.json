A text-mining tool (Leximancer) was used to identify key concepts and themes emerging throughout each of the five decades, which were then compared to those found in a previous analysis of Computers & Education, as well as the most cited BJET publications in each decade. The framework of West and Rich (2012) was then used to provide guidance on BJET\u2019s rigour, impact and prestige. Common themes in BJET throughout the past 50 years have included the evolution of teaching and learning in distance education, the emergence of instructional design, misunderstanding between practitioners and learning designers, issues of pre and in-service teacher education and technology uptake by educators and students, including the confidence to do so, the technology skills of educators and students, as well as a lack of institutional support to provide space and time for training and integration to occur. The authorship analysis revealed an encouraging increase in international identity over time, with 60% of articles in BJET published by an author outside of the UK over the past 50 years, and 79% in the past decade. Despite this, contributions from South America, the Middle East and Africa are vastly underrepresented, and authors from these regions need further support from the field. Suggested future research areas include finding alternative models of educator professional development, further exploration of the role of theory and policy, as well as the rise of co-authorship and collaborative research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Authorship analysis", "Collaborative research", "Institutional support", "Instructional designs", "Professional development", "Teacher education", "Teaching and learning", "Technology skills"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059087637", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57203882659": {"Name": "Bond M.", "AuthorID": "57203882659", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education and Social Sciences (Center for Open Education Research), University of Oldenburg"}, "8674150200": {"Name": "Zawacki-Richter O.", "AuthorID": "8674150200", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education and Social Sciences (Center for Open Education Research), University of Oldenburg"}, "7202674246": {"Name": "Nichols M.", "AuthorID": "7202674246", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University"}}}
