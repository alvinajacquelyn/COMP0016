There has been an improvement in overall outcome and survival over the past three decades, but it still has the highest mortality among any of the autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Progress in its management has come through more organized assessment and treatment together with the emergence of therapies that can target specific complications of the disease such as renal crisis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, there is a growing understanding of pathogenesis that allows more targeted approaches to therapy to be explored in clinical trials. In this review, several aspects of SSc management including the more targeted therapies including strategies to block specific pathways or mediators have been discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunosuppressants", "Scleroderma", "Systemic sclerosis", "Therapies", "Treatments"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014014731", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"55338274400": {"Name": "Raja J.", "AuthorID": "55338274400", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department and Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}}}
