We developed a new method of RAPD quantification based on the recording of the infrared pupillary asymmetry (IPA) with a standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) device. Methods: The diagnostic value of the IPA for detection of the RAPD was determined by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC). Results: Twenty-nine subjects were included in this study (17 controls and 12 unilateral optic neuropathies). The IPA was significantly greater in unilateral optic neuropathies (0.39) compared to controls (0.18, p = 0.001). The diagnostic value was good with a ROC\u2013AUC of 0.843. Importantly, the IPA correlated significantly with the inter-eye percentage difference of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thickness (R = 0.53, p = 0.01). Assessment of the IPA took less than 30 s. Conclusion: The present data show that the IPA is a practical and rapid test that can be applied in a clinical setting. The IPA may be a valuable functional outcome measure for clinical trials, complementing structural retinal OCT data in a biological meaningful way. The IPA should be further investigated for suitability for optic neuritis treatment trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infrared pupillary asymmetry", "IPA", "Optical coherence tomography", "RAPD", "Relative afferent pupillary defect"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Area Under Curve", "Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Pupil Disorders", "Reflex, Abnormal", "Retrospective Studies", "ROC Curve", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061397058", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57205744973": {"Name": "Meneguette N.S.", "AuthorID": "57205744973", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57205895491": {"Name": "de Carvalho J.E.R.", "AuthorID": "57205895491", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Amsterdam UMC, AMC Amsterdam"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology & Ophthalmology, Neuro-ophthalmology Expertise Centre, Amsterdam UMC"}}}
