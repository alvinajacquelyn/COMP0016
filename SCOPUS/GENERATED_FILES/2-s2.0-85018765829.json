We aimed to determine the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging-derived PSAD (MR-PSAD) in predicting transperineal sector-guided prostate biopsy (TPSB) outcomes. Materials and methods: Men presenting for primary TPSB from 2007 to 2014 were considered. Histological outcomes were assessed and defined as: presence of any cancer or significant cancer defined as presence of Gleason 4 and/or maximum tumour core length (MCCL) \u2265 4 mm (G4); or Gleason 4 and/or MCCL \u2265 6 mm (G6). Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to compare MR-PSAD and PSA. Results: Six hundred fifty-nine men were evaluated with mean age 62.5 \u00b1 9 years, median PSA 6.7 ng/ml (range 0.5\u201340.0), prostate volume 40 cc (range 7\u2013187) and MR-PSAD 0.15 ng/ml/cc (range 0.019\u20131.3). ROC area under the curve (95% CI) was significantly better for MR-PSAD than PSA for all cancer definitions (p < 0.001): 0.73 (0.70\u20130.76) versus 0.61 (0.57\u20130.64) for any cancer; 0.75 (0.71\u20130.78) versus 0.66 (0.62\u20130.69) for G4; and 0.77 (0.74\u20130.80) versus 0.68 (0.64\u20130.71) for G6. Sensitivities for MR-PSAD < 0.1 ng/ml/cc were 85.0, 89.9 and 91.9% for any, G4 and G6 cancer, respectively. Conclusion: MR-PSAD may be better than total PSA in determining risk of positive biopsy outcome. Its use may improve risk stratification and reduce unnecessary biopsies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostate biopsy", "Prostate volume", "Prostate-specific antigen", "Prostatic neoplasms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Perineum", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prostate", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018765829", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57194112410": {"Name": "MacAskill F.", "AuthorID": "57194112410", "AffiliationID": "60033321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Southend University Hospital"}, "56982099700": {"Name": "Lee S.M.", "AuthorID": "56982099700", "AffiliationID": "60026958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Weston General Hospital"}, "14027911200": {"Name": "Acher P.", "AuthorID": "14027911200", "AffiliationID": "60030748", "AffiliationName": "London Bridge Hospital"}, "55752715900": {"Name": "Eldred-Evans D.", "AuthorID": "55752715900", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602470035": {"Name": "Popert R.", "AuthorID": "6602470035", "AffiliationID": "60030748", "AffiliationName": "London Bridge Hospital"}, "55372637900": {"Name": "Wulaningsih W.", "AuthorID": "55372637900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, Cancer Epidemiology Group, King\u2019s College London"}, "25932351400": {"Name": "Van Hemelrijck M.", "AuthorID": "25932351400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, Cancer Epidemiology Group, King\u2019s College London"}, "6701518117": {"Name": "Rottenberg G.", "AuthorID": "6701518117", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}, "56594555300": {"Name": "Wolfe K.", "AuthorID": "56594555300", "AffiliationID": "60033321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Southend University Hospital"}, "7004277307": {"Name": "Liyanage S.H.", "AuthorID": "7004277307", "AffiliationID": "60033321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Southend University Hospital"}}}
