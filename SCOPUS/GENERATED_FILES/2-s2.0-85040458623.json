For this purpose two independently operating branchlines and endstations have been built. The imaging branch is fully operational for micro-tomography and in-line phase contrast imaging with micrometre resolution. Grating interferometry is currently implemented, adding the capability of measuring phase and small-angle information. For tomography with increased resolution a full-field microscope providing 50nm spatial resolution with a field of view of 100\u03bcm is being tested. The instrument provides a large working distance between optics and sample to adapt a wide range of customised sample environments. On the coherence branch coherent diffraction imaging techniques such as ptychography, coherent X-ray diffraction (CXRD) are currently developed for three dimensional imaging with the highest resolution. The imaging branch is operated in collaboration with Manchester University, called therefore the Diamond-Manchester Branchline. The scientific applications cover a large area including bio-medicine, materials science, chemistry geology and more. The present paper provides an overview about the current status of the beamline and the science addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nano-imaging", "Phase contrast", "Synchrotron radiation", "Tomography", "X-ray microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coherent diffraction imaging", "Coherent x-ray diffraction", "In-line phase contrast imaging", "Nano-imaging", "Phase contrasts", "Scientific applications", "Three dimensional imaging", "X ray microscopy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040458623", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}, "57064238500": {"Name": "Bodey A.", "AuthorID": "57064238500", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57195677572": {"Name": "Storm M.", "AuthorID": "57195677572", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "34869372800": {"Name": "Cipiccia S.", "AuthorID": "34869372800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55560936200": {"Name": "Marathe S.", "AuthorID": "55560936200", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56239593200": {"Name": "Zdora M.", "AuthorID": "56239593200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "25822794700": {"Name": "Zanette I.", "AuthorID": "25822794700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "36103067800": {"Name": "Wagner U.", "AuthorID": "36103067800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55754252000": {"Name": "Batey D.", "AuthorID": "55754252000", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "36621907300": {"Name": "Shi X.", "AuthorID": "36621907300", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
