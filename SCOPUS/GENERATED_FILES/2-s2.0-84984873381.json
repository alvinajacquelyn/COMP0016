The rapid development of \u201cNoSQL\u201d databases (structured storage services) in the last five years allowed an extended and complementary usage of traditional relational databases and new structured storage tools in order to improve the performance of existing applications and to extend their functionalities using the possibilities offered by the modern storage systems. The trend is towards using the best tool for each kind of data, separating for example the intrinsically relational metadata from payload storage, and records that are frequently updated and benefit from transactions from archived information. Access to all components has to be orchestrated by specialised services that run on front-end machines and shield the user from the complexity of data storage infrastructure. This paper describes this technology evolution in the ATLAS database infrastructure and presents a few examples of large database applications that benefit from it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATLAS", "CERN LHC", "Conditions", "Database", "Hadoop", "Metadata", "Oracle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984873381", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7007066092": {"Name": "Barberis D.", "AuthorID": "7007066092", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60021660", "AffiliationName": "Sezione di Genova, University of Genova and INFN"}, "56463039300": {"Name": "ATLAS Collaboration", "AuthorID": "56463039300", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60021660", "AffiliationName": "Sezione di Genova, University of Genova and INFN"}}}
