The resulting acquisitions contain highly attenuated images that present particular challenges when there is motion and geometric distortion. This study proposes to address these challenges by breaking with the conventional one-volume-one-encoding paradigm employed in conventional diffusion imaging using single-shot Echo Planar Imaging. By enabling free choice of the diffusion encoding on the slice level, a higher temporal sampling of slices with low b-value can be achieved. These allow more robust motion correction, and in combination with a second reversed phase-encoded echo, also dynamic distortion correction. These proposed advances are validated on phantom and adult experiments and employed in a study of eight foetal subjects. Equivalence in obtained diffusion quantities with the conventional method is demonstrated as well as benefits in distortion and motion correction. The resulting capability can be combined with any acquisition parameters including multiband imaging and allows application to diffusion MRI studies in general.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion", "EPI", "Foetal imaging", "Microstructure", "Motion correction", "MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition parameters", "Conventional methods", "Distortion correction", "Echo planar imaging", "Geometric distortion", "Geometric orientation", "Microstructural modelling", "Motion correction", "Adult", "Artifacts", "Brain Mapping", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Echo-Planar Imaging", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Motion", "Phantoms, Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049330848", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55332244600": {"Name": "Hutter J.", "AuthorID": "55332244600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "56648004600": {"Name": "Christiaens D.J.", "AuthorID": "56648004600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "16174301800": {"Name": "Cordero-Grande L.", "AuthorID": "16174301800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "57209332012": {"Name": "Deprez M.", "AuthorID": "57209332012", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "35335108200": {"Name": "Price A.N.", "AuthorID": "35335108200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "7005529767": {"Name": "Tournier J.D.", "AuthorID": "7005529767", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "55165088800": {"Name": "Rutherford M.", "AuthorID": "55165088800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "35430060900": {"Name": "Hajnal J.V.", "AuthorID": "35430060900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the developing Brain, King's College London"}, "36622407700": {"Name": "Schneider T.", "AuthorID": "36622407700", "AffiliationID": "60021681", "AffiliationName": "Philips"}, "56989806800": {"Name": "Slator P.J.", "AuthorID": "56989806800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
