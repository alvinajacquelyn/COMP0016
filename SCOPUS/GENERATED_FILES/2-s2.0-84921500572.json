All rights reserved.Background: Stereopsis is believed to be advantageous for surgical tasks that require precise hand-eye coordination. We investigated the effects of short-term and long-term absence of stereopsis on motor task performance in three-dimensional (3D) and twodimensional (2D) viewing conditions. Methods: 30 participants with normal stereopsis and 15 participants with absent stereopsis performed a simulated surgical task both in free space under direct vision (3D) and via a monitor (2D), with both eyes open and one eye covered in each condition. Results: The stereo-normal group scored higher, on average, than the stereo-absent group with both eyes open under direct vision (p<0.001). Both groups performed comparably in monocular and binocular monitor viewing conditions (p=0.579). Conclusions: High-grade stereopsis confers an advantage when performing a fine motor task under direct vision. However, stereopsis does not appear advantageous to task performance under 2D viewing conditions, such as in video-assisted surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Computer Simulation", "Depth Perception", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures", "Perceptual Disorders", "Psychomotor Performance", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Video-Assisted Surgery", "Vision Disparity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921500572", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"54402255500": {"Name": "Bloch E.", "AuthorID": "54402255500", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "56344323400": {"Name": "Uddin N.", "AuthorID": "56344323400", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56344210600": {"Name": "Gannon L.", "AuthorID": "56344210600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209870099": {"Name": "Jain S.", "AuthorID": "57209870099", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "15061701400": {"Name": "Rantell K.", "AuthorID": "15061701400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
