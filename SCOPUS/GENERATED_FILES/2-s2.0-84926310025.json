The first, and dominant, framework focuses on flows from the 'periphery' to the 'core', although that 'core' is also evolving (and is no longer dominated by North America and Western Europe but is increasingly likely to embrace dynamic East Asia systems). This first approach is labelled 'hegemonic internationalisation'. The second framework focuses instead on issues of development, the emergence of global communities and social movements. This is labelled 'fluid globalisation'. The article argues that the latter may be more useful for understanding trends in academic mobility.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926310025", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"8836098600": {"Name": "Scott P.", "AuthorID": "8836098600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
