We compared clinical cerebral MRI reports in 59 PLWH and 29 lifestyle matched controls. Although clinical abnormalities were highly prevalent (47.7%), and included white-matter lesions (46.6%), microvascular disease (22.7%) and cerebral volume loss (11.4%), no differences were apparent between PLWH and controls, with abnormalities being associated with age and hypertension rather than HIV serostatus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Brain", "Brain Diseases", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064140781", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57193757346": {"Name": "Chhabra S.", "AuthorID": "57193757346", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "47661632000": {"Name": "Underwood J.", "AuthorID": "47661632000", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and Genitourinary Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and Genitourinary Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7403376270": {"Name": "Cole J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403376270", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Imperial College London"}, "35559514400": {"Name": "Sharp D.J.", "AuthorID": "35559514400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Imperial College London"}, "55908175900": {"Name": "Caan M.", "AuthorID": "55908175900", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center"}, "57216675262": {"Name": "Waldman A.", "AuthorID": "57216675262", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60138854", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
