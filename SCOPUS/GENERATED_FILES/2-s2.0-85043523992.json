Despite these successes, gene therapy unfortunately also has had to face severe adverse events in the form of leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, related to the semi-random vector integration into the host cell genome that caused deregulation of neighboring proto-oncogenes. Although improvements in vector design clearly lowered the risk of this insertional mutagenesis, analysis of potential genotoxicity and the consequences of vector integration remain important parameters for basic and translational research and most importantly for the clinic. Here, we review current assays to analyze biodistribution and genotoxicity in the pre-clinical setting and describe tools to monitor vector integration sites in vector-treated patients as a biosafety readout.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AAV", "clinical translation", "gammaretroviral", "gene therapy", "insertional mutagenesis", "lentiviral", "regulatory authorities", "vector"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043523992", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36963939500": {"Name": "Biasco L.", "AuthorID": "36963939500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56661903100": {"Name": "Rothe M.", "AuthorID": "56661903100", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School"}, "7003415770": {"Name": "B\u00fcning H.", "AuthorID": "7003415770", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School"}, "6507714915": {"Name": "Schambach A.", "AuthorID": "6507714915", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
