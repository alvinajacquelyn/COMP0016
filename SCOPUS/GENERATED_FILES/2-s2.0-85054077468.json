All rights reserved.Secreted pulmonary surfactant phosphatidylcholine (PC) has a complex intra-alveolar metabolism that involves uptake and recycling by alveolar type II epithelial cells, catabolism by alveolar macrophages, and loss up the bronchial tree. We compared the in vivo metabolism of animal-derived poractant alfa (Curosurf) and a synthetic surfactant (CHF5633) in adult male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were dosed intranasally with either surfactant (80 mg/kg body weight) containing universally13C-labeled dipalmitoyl PC (DPPC) as a tracer. The loss of [U13C]DPPC from bronchoalveolar lavage and lung parenchyma, together with the incorporation of 13C-hydrolysis fragments into new PC molecular species, was monitored by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The catabolism of CHF5633 was considerably delayed compared with poractant alfa, the hydrolysis products of which were cleared more rapidly. There was no selective resynthesis of DPPC and, strikingly, acyl remodeling resulted in preferential synthesis of polyunsaturated PC species. In conclusion, both surfactants were metabolized by similar pathways, but the slower catabolism of CHF5633 resulted in longer residence time in the airways and enhanced recycling of its hydrolysis products into new PC species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acyl remodeling", "Mass spectrometry", "Molecular species", "Phosphatidylcholine synthesis", "Stable isotopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Products", "Lung", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphatidylcholines", "Phospholipids", "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B", "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein C", "Pulmonary Surfactants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054077468", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57209130285": {"Name": "Madsen J.", "AuthorID": "57209130285", "AffiliationID": "113425154", "AffiliationName": "Child Health, Clinical and Experimental Sciences"}, "57204013059": {"Name": "Panchal M.H.", "AuthorID": "57204013059", "AffiliationID": "113425154", "AffiliationName": "Child Health, Clinical and Experimental Sciences"}, "55435435700": {"Name": "Mackay R.M.A.", "AuthorID": "55435435700", "AffiliationID": "113425154", "AffiliationName": "Child Health, Clinical and Experimental Sciences"}, "7005900147": {"Name": "Koster G.", "AuthorID": "7005900147", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60004024", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Hospital 12 de Octubre Research Institute, Complutense University, National Institute for Health Research"}, "7202405777": {"Name": "Clark H.W.", "AuthorID": "7202405777", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60004024", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Hospital 12 de Octubre Research Institute, Complutense University, National Institute for Health Research"}, "7006798715": {"Name": "Postle A.D.", "AuthorID": "7006798715", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60004024", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Hospital 12 de Octubre Research Institute, Complutense University, National Institute for Health Research"}, "6508001803": {"Name": "Echaide M.", "AuthorID": "6508001803", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}, "7004136416": {"Name": "Perez-Gil J.", "AuthorID": "7004136416", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}, "57204010551": {"Name": "Aquino G.", "AuthorID": "57204010551", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60073828", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton, Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA"}, "6602946990": {"Name": "Pelizzi N.", "AuthorID": "6602946990", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60073828", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton, Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA"}, "55519893600": {"Name": "Salomone F.", "AuthorID": "55519893600", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60073828", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton, Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA"}}}
