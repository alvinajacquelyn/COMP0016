This paper aims to assess the association of variation in use of definitive therapy on risk-adjusted PCM in England as compared with the USA. Design: Observational study. Setting: Cancer registry data from England and the USA. Participants: Men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) in England and the USA between 2004 and 2008. Outcome measures: Competing-risks survival analyses to estimate subhazard ratios (SHR) of PCM adjusted for age, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, Gleason score (GS) and clinical tumour (cT) stage. Results: 222 163 men were eligible for inclusion. Compared with American patients, English patients were more likely to present at an older age (70-79 years: England 44.2%, USA 29.3%, p<0.001), with higher tumour stage (cT3-T4: England 25.1%, USA 8.6%, p<0.001) and higher GS (GS 8- 10: England 20.7%, USA 11.2%, p<0.001). They were also less likely to receive definitive therapy (England 38%, USA 77%, p<0.001). English patients were more likely to die of PCa (SHR=1.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.0, p<0.001). However, this difference was no longer statistically significant when also adjusted for use of definitive therapy (SHR=1.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.1, p=0.3). Conclusions: Risk-adjusted PCM is significantly higher in England compared with the USA. This difference may be explained by less frequent use of definitive therapy in England.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Distribution", "Aged", "Analysis of Variance", "Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostate", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Registries", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923675604", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"37057844300": {"Name": "Sachdeva A.", "AuthorID": "37057844300", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Freeman Hospital"}, "7102799145": {"Name": "Van Der Meulen J.", "AuthorID": "7102799145", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "9739106900": {"Name": "Cathcart P.", "AuthorID": "9739106900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine, Bart's Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
