In an effort to improve the accuracy of an AD diagnosis, it is important to be able to distinguish between AD and other types of dementia (non-AD). The concentration ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 (A\u03b242/40 Ratio) has been suggested to be superior to the concentration of A\u03b242 alone when identifying patients with AD. This article reviews the available evidence on the use of the CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio in the diagnosis of AD. Based on the body of evidence presented herein, it is the conclusion of the current working group that the CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio, rather than the absolute value of CSF A\u03b242, should be used when analysing CSF AD biomarkers to improve the percentage of appropriately diagnosed patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s Disease", "Amyloid\u03b2 Peptides", "A\u03b242/40 ratio", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal Fluid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Peptide Fragments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064685368", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7102616467": {"Name": "Lehmann S.", "AuthorID": "7102616467", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60031773, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence for Neurodegenerative disorders (COEN) of Montpellier, Montpellier University, CHU Montpellier, INSERM"}, "7201539859": {"Name": "Otto M.", "AuthorID": "7201539859", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Ulm"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "120590429", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "55156917800": {"Name": "Lewczuk P.", "AuthorID": "55156917800", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Lab for Clinical Neurochemistry and Neurochemical Dementia Diagnostics, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen"}}}
