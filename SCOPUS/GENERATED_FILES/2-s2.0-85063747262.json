The typical body may be of given shape or flexible depending on the context. In the background there are numerous real-world motivations in industry, biomedical and environmental applications, many of which involve high flow rates. A review of ideas developed over the last decade for cases of high flow rates first addresses inviscid approaches to one or more bodies free to move within a channel flow, a skimming sharp-edged body on a free surface, the sinking of a body in water and the rocking or rolling of a body on a solid surface, before moving on to more recent viscous-inviscid approaches for channel flows and boundary layers. The beginnings of certain current research projects are also outlined. These concern models of liftoff of a body from a solid surface, the impact of a smooth body during skimming and viscous-inviscid effects in the presence of more than one freely moving body. Linear and nonlinear mathematical properties as appropriate are described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Channel flow", "Fluid-solid interactions", "Lift-off", "Skimming"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063747262", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)", "DECI", "1801"]], "AuthorData": {"55248576300": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "55248576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57191578659": {"Name": "Balta S.", "AuthorID": "57191578659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55927772100": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "55927772100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189658000": {"Name": "Johnson E.", "AuthorID": "57189658000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
