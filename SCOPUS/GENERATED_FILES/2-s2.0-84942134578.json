This allows one to capture three-body Efimov physics, as well as to recover the first nontrivial terms in the weak-coupling expansion. We show that the energy and quasiparticle residue of the dressed impurity (polaron) are significantly lowered by three-body correlations, even for weak interactions where there is no Efimov trimer state in a vacuum. For increasing attraction between the impurity and the BEC, we observe a smooth crossover from atom to Efimov trimer, with a superposition of states near the Efimov resonance. We furthermore demonstrate that three-body loss does not prohibit the experimental observation of these effects. Our results thus suggest a route to realizing Efimov physics in a stable quantum many-body system for the first time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bogoliubov excitations", "Bose-Einstein condensates", "Impurity particles", "Quantum many-body systems", "Superposition of state", "Three-body correlations", "Weak interactions", "Zero-temperature properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942134578", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6508193614": {"Name": "Levinsen J.", "AuthorID": "6508193614", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}, "9240980200": {"Name": "Parish M.M.", "AuthorID": "9240980200", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "6701654777": {"Name": "Bruun G.M.", "AuthorID": "6701654777", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}}}
