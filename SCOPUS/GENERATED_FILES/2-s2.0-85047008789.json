To do so, we implemented various stress regimens to analyze changes evoked in these rat brain structures. We utilized several molecular techniques, including western blot, ELISA, quantitative RT-PCR, and various biochemical assays, to examine a range of proteins and subjected rats to behavioral tests to evaluate potential maladaptive alterations. A decrease in the level of growth factors in the FCx was accompanied by changes suggesting damage of this structure in the manner of regulated necrosis, while the Hp appeared to be protected. The observed changes in the brain region-specific alterations in neurotrophin processing may also depend on the period of life, in which an animal experiences stress and the duration of the stressful stimuli. We conclude that chronic stress during pregnancy can result in serious alterations in the functioning of the FCx of the progeny, facilitating the development of depressive behavior later in life. We also suggest that the altered energy metabolism may redirect pro-NGF/p75 NTR /ATF2 signaling in the cortical neurons towards cellular death resembling regulated necrosis, rather than apoptosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression models", "Frontal cortex", "Hippocampus", "Neurotrophines", "Oxidative stress", "Regulated necrosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cerebral Cortex", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Hippocampus", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Necrosis", "Neurons", "Oxidative Stress", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Signal Transduction", "Stress, Psychological", "Temporal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047008789", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56511468700": {"Name": "Kucharczyk M.", "AuthorID": "56511468700", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56363578400": {"Name": "Kurek A.", "AuthorID": "56363578400", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "55356757800": {"Name": "Detka J.", "AuthorID": "55356757800", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "7003641200": {"Name": "Budziszewska B.", "AuthorID": "7003641200", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "36915666800": {"Name": "Pomierny B.", "AuthorID": "36915666800", "AffiliationID": "60021323, 60021361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Toxicology, Chair of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical College, Jagiellonian University"}, "7102815839": {"Name": "Papp M.", "AuthorID": "7102815839", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "57170497000": {"Name": "Tota K.", "AuthorID": "57170497000", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}}}
