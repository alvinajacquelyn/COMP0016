Previous approaches have been mostly limited to predicting diagonal covariance matrices [15]. Our novel model learns to predict a full Gaussian covariance matrix for each reconstruction, which permits efficient sampling and likelihood evaluation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct ground truth correlated residual distributions for synthetic datasets and generate plausible high frequency samples for real face images. We also illustrate the use of these predicted covariances for structure preserving image denoising.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Covariance matrices", "Efficient sampling", "High frequency HF", "Residual distribution", "Structure-preserving", "Structured uncertainties", "Synthesized images", "Synthetic datasets"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062851767", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"57200306692": {"Name": "Dorta G.", "AuthorID": "57200306692", "AffiliationID": "60121112", "AffiliationName": "Anthropics Technology Ltd."}, "57213952541": {"Name": "Campbell N.D.F.", "AuthorID": "57213952541", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath"}, "52364860800": {"Name": "Simpson I.", "AuthorID": "52364860800", "AffiliationID": "60121112", "AffiliationName": "Anthropics Technology Ltd."}, "24829674800": {"Name": "Vicente S.", "AuthorID": "24829674800", "AffiliationID": "60121112", "AffiliationName": "Anthropics Technology Ltd."}, "12752515600": {"Name": "Agapito L.", "AuthorID": "12752515600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
