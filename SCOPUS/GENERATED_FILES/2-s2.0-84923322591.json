These are risky, inconvenient, and costly procedures. In some patients, pyridoxine treatment can delay the need for these surgical procedures. The underlying cause of particular forms of this disease is the misrouting of a specific enzyme, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), to the mitochondria instead of the peroxisomes. Pharmacoperones are small molecules that can rescue misfolded proteins and redirect them to their correct location, thereby restoring their function and potentially curing disease. In the present study, we miniaturized a cell-based assay to identify pharmacoperone drugs present in large chemical libraries to selectively correct AGT misrouting. This assay employs AGT-170, a mutant form of AGT that predominantly resides in the mitochondria, which we monitor for its relocation to the peroxisomes through automated image acquisition and analysis. Over the course of a pilot screen of 1,280 test compounds, we achieved an average Z\u2032-factor of 0.72\u00b10.02, demonstrating the suitability of this assay for HTS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Assay", "Cell Survival", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Drug Design", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Hyperoxaluria, Primary", "Molecular Chaperones", "Phenotype", "Technology, Pharmaceutical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923322591", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"24067230400": {"Name": "Madoux F.", "AuthorID": "24067230400", "AffiliationID": "60001462", "AffiliationName": "Lead Identification Division, Translational Research Institute, Scripps Research Institute"}, "6601978592": {"Name": "Scampavia L.", "AuthorID": "6601978592", "AffiliationID": "60001462", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Therapeutics, Scripps Research Institute"}, "7004075819": {"Name": "Spicer T.", "AuthorID": "7004075819", "AffiliationID": "60001462", "AffiliationName": "Lead Identification Division, Translational Research Institute, Scripps Research Institute"}, "56214098700": {"Name": "Janovick J.", "AuthorID": "56214098700", "AffiliationID": "60032964", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Internal Medicine and Cell Biology/Biochemistry, Center for Membrane Protein Research, Texas Tech.
