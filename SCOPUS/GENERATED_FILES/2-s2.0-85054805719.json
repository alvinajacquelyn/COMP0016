This paper focuses on system dynamics modelling and simulation research and its potential contribution to transition research. Current system dynamics work comes from a wide range of disciplines and spans across the micro, meso, and macro levels which transitions are predominantly analysed along. This overlap carries considerable potential as a conceptual and theoretical basis for transition research. The paper explores this potential and provides a cursory exposition of system dynamics research and exemplary work that is directly relevant to transition research. It raises a number of points that indicate the potential of system dynamics for transition research in terms of methodology and case study research, the behavioural aspects of transitions, and particular subject areas that lie at the organizational field level: technology platforms, business models and organizational change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Simulation methods", "Sustainability", "System dynamics", "Transitions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054805719", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"54385627300": {"Name": "Papachristos G.", "AuthorID": "54385627300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE), Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London"}}}
