When the ROI contains a pipe flow, the decay is shown to be sensitive to the average flow velocity from which the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the scattering centers in the flow can be estimated. While the MSD estimated is seen to be an order of magnitude higher than that obtainable through the usual diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) without the US, it is seen to be more accurate as verified by the volume flow estimated from it. It is further observed that, whereas the MSD from the localized measurement grows with time as \u03c4\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2248 1.65, without using the US, \u03b1 is seen to be much less. Moreover, with the local measurement, this super-diffusive nature of the pipe flow is seen to persist longer, i.e., over a wider range of initial \u03c4, than with the unassisted DWS. The reason for the super-diffusivity of flow, i.e., \u03b1 < 2, in the ROI is the presence of a fluctuating (thermodynamically nonequilibrium) component in the dynamics induced by the US forcing. Beyond this initial range, both methods measure MSDs that rise linearly with time, indicating that ballistic and near-ballistic photons hardly capture anything beyond the background Brownian motion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Detection and estimation", "Diffuse correlation spectroscopy", "Diffusing-wave spectroscopy", "Focused ultrasound", "Intensity autocorrelation", "Mean squared displacement", "Scattering centers", "The region of interest (ROI)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953380928", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"14055545400": {"Name": "Chandran R.", "AuthorID": "14055545400", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Instrumentation, Applied Physics Department, Indian Institute of Science"}, "55663544800": {"Name": "Vasu R.", "AuthorID": "55663544800", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Instrumentation, Applied Physics Department, Indian Institute of Science"}, "16308860600": {"Name": "Devaraj G.", "AuthorID": "16308860600", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Computational Mechanics Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "7402439420": {"Name": "Roy D.", "AuthorID": "7402439420", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Computational Mechanics Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "14519352500": {"Name": "Kanhirodan R.", "AuthorID": "14519352500", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science"}}}
