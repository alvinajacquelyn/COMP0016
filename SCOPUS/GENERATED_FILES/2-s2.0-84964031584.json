We present the fit quality within the context of the global fit and when only the HERA data are included. We examine the changes in both the central values and the uncertainties in the PDFs. We find that the prediction for the data is good, and only relatively small improvements in (Formula presented.) and changes in the PDFs are obtained with a refit at both NLO and NNLO. PDF uncertainties are slightly reduced. There is a small dependence of the fit quality on the value of (Formula presented.). This can be improved by phenomenologically motived corrections to (Formula presented.) which parametrically are largely in the form of higher-twist type contributions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964031584", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15035882900": {"Name": "Motylinski P.", "AuthorID": "15035882900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101652961": {"Name": "Thorne R.S.", "AuthorID": "7101652961", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7404932388": {"Name": "Martin A.D.", "AuthorID": "7404932388", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, Durham University"}}}
