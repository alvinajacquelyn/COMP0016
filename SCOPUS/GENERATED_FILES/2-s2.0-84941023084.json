For shorthand these are termed 'satisficing', 'optimising', and 'transforming' domains, with corresponding underpinnings found in behavioural, neoclassical, and evolutionary economics respectively. Each domain operates at different scales of time and personal/organisational/societal decision-making, and explains different characteristics of how energy systems develop. At least since the industrial revolution, the nature of energy systems has depended on government policy, and each domain implies a need for different policy instruments; the combination of all three lays the foundations for far more coherent, effective, and mutually reinforcing policies, including those required to transform energy systems in the light of environmental constraints. The approach also provides a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which co-benefits and 'green growth' may emerge from environmental policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural economics", "Climate policy", "Energy innovation", "Energy transitions", "Evolutionary economics", "Sustainable development", "Three Domains"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climate policy", "Energy transitions", "Environmental constraints", "Environmental policy", "Evolutionary Economics", "Industrial revolutions", "Policy instruments", "Theoretical framework"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941023084", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"7006809226": {"Name": "Grubb M.", "AuthorID": "7006809226", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "35617721600": {"Name": "Hourcade J.C.", "AuthorID": "35617721600", "AffiliationID": "60104338", "AffiliationName": "Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et Developpement (CIRED)"}, "8508045400": {"Name": "Neuhoff K.", "AuthorID": "8508045400", "AffiliationID": "60006658", "AffiliationName": "Deutches Institut fur Wirtschaftforschnung (DIW)"}}}
