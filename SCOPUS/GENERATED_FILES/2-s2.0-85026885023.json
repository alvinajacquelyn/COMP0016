All rights reserved.The use of spectrally shaped amplified spontaneous emission noise (SS-ASE) as a method for emulating interfering channels in optical fibre transmission systems has been studied. It is shown that the use of SS-ASE leads to a slightly pessimistic performance relative to the use of conventionally modulated interfering channels in the nonlinear regime. The additional nonlinear interference noise (on the channel under test), due to the Gaussian nature of SS-ASE, has been calculated using a combination of the Gaussian noise (GN) and enhanced GN (EGN) models for the entire C-band (4.5 THz) and experimentally shown to provide a lower bound for transmission performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amplified spontaneous emission noise", "Gaussians", "Interference noise", "Interfering channels", "Lower bounds", "Non-linear regimes", "Optical fibre transmission", "Transmission performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026885023", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57191056637": {"Name": "Elson D.", "AuthorID": "57191056637", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "57193389959": {"Name": "Saavedra G.", "AuthorID": "57193389959", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "57192990604": {"Name": "Semrau D.", "AuthorID": "57192990604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}}}
