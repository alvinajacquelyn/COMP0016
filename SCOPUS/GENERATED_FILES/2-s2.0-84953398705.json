The patient is one of the oldest reported survivors with this condition. This semiologywas noted while she was being monitored by inpatient video telemetry. We observed a series of myoclonic shoulder jerks, followed by hiccup-like episodes, and finally an atonic head drop. Corresponding ictal EEG showed semirhythmic high-amplitude slow waves with spikes superimposed over the frontotemporal areas. This semiologywas confirmed as habitual by her parents. Subsequent hiccup-like episodes had no EEG correlate, and the head drop was again associated with semi-rhythmic high-amplitude slow waves and superimposed spikes, more prominent over the right hemisphere. In addition, we review the several cases in which hiccups have been associated with seizures and how this may relate to the neural pathways involved in the pathophysiology of hiccups. We believe the ictal hiccup-like episodes followed by atonia to be a seizure semiology that has not previously been documented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atonic seizure", "Hiccups", "Seizure", "Trisomy 4p"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4", "Diaphragm", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Generalized", "Female", "Humans", "Muscle Hypotonia", "Myoclonus", "Trisomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953398705", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57040763800": {"Name": "Varley J.", "AuthorID": "57040763800", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55913795300": {"Name": "Wehner T.", "AuthorID": "55913795300", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005111176": {"Name": "Sisodiya S.", "AuthorID": "7005111176", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
