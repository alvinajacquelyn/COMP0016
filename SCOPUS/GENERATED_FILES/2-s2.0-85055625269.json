The effects of the underlying pathology on brain morphology are relatively well understood. Numerous structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated macrostructural change with widespread striatal and cortical atrophy and microstructural white matter loss in premanifest and manifest HD gene carriers. However, disease effects on brain function are less well characterized. Functional MRI provides an opportunity to examine differences in brain activity either in response to a particular task or in the brain at rest. There is increasing evidence that HD gene carriers exhibit altered activation patterns and functional connectivity between brain regions in response to the neurodegenerative process. Here we review the growing literature in this area and critically evaluate the utility of this imaging modality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Connectivity", "fMRI", "Huntington's disease", "Neuroimaging", "Resting state", "Task"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive Dysfunction", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Nerve Net"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055625269", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56785241700": {"Name": "Gregory S.", "AuthorID": "56785241700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
