The antibacterial activity of the polymer was tested against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under white light conditions comparable to that found in a UK healthcare environment. The modified polymer demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against both bacteria (>4 log reduction in bacterial numbers). To the best of our knowledge, this is the most potent light-induced antibacterial polymer reported to date.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-bacterial activity", "Antibacterial polymers", "Antibacterial properties", "Bacterial numbers", "Healthcare environments", "Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Zinc oxide nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921270538", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56395043500": {"Name": "Ozkan E.", "AuthorID": "56395043500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56478592600": {"Name": "Ozkan F.", "AuthorID": "56478592600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
