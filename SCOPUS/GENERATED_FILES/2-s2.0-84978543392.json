Secondary analysis explored effects of gender and ethnicity. Design Prospective observational study. Participants Consecutive patients attending a weekly nurse-led postoperative clinic. Methods The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), a validated, postinterventional questionnaire (not specific to one particular medical or surgical intervention), was administered. Mean scores were calculated. Scores were compared when patients were grouped by first or second eye, and by gender or ethnicity (unpaired t test). Scores potentially range from +100 (maximum benefit) to \u2212100 (maximum detriment). Results The GBI was administered 113 times to 109 patients (4 patients were seen after both first and second eye surgery). Mean overall score was +22.8 (median +19.4; SD 19.7; 95% CI +19.2 to +26.4). Mean (SD) subscores were +30.5 (25.3), +17.8 (26.7), and \u22123.1 (19.9) for general, social support, and physical health subdomains, respectively. Total benefit scores were not significantly different for first or second eye surgery, or across gender (p > 0.3). Scores for patients of African (including African Caribbean) ethnicity were significantly higher than those obtained from European patients (p = 0.002). Conclusions Patients reported significant improvements in quality of life even a few weeks after cataract surgery, as assessed by the GBI. Second eye surgery appeared to confer similar benefit to first eye surgery. The significant difference in scores between ethnic groups invites further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cataract", "Cataract Extraction", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Personality Assessment", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Pseudophakia", "Quality of Life", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978543392", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57190225027": {"Name": "Heemraz B.S.", "AuthorID": "57190225027", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57190224673": {"Name": "Lee C.N.", "AuthorID": "57190224673", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7102559046": {"Name": "Hammond C.J.", "AuthorID": "7102559046", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, King's College London"}, "6507036910": {"Name": "Mahroo O.A.", "AuthorID": "6507036910", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172674, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57203644841": {"Name": "Hysi P.G.", "AuthorID": "57203644841", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London"}, "55474250800": {"Name": "Jones C.A.", "AuthorID": "55474250800", "AffiliationID": "60004229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Maidstone Hospital"}}}
