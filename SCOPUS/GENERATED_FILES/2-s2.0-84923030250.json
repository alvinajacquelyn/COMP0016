We examined human remains, with paleopathological lesions indicative of leprosy, dated to the 6th-11th century AD, from Central and Eastern Europe and Byzantine Anatolia. Analysis of ancient DNA and bacterial cell wall lipid biomarkers revealed Mycobacterium leprae in skeletal remains from 6th-8th century Northern Italy, 7th-11th century Hungary, 8th-9th century Austria, the Slavic Greater Moravian Empire of the 9th-10th century and 8th-10th century Byzantine samples from Northern Anatolia. These data were analyzed alongside findings published by others. M. leprae is an obligate human pathogen that has undergone an evolutionary bottleneck followed by clonal expansion. Therefore M. leprae genotypes and sub-genotypes give information about the human populations they have infected and their migration. Although data are limited, genotyping demonstrates that historical M. leprae from Byzantine Anatolia, Eastern and Central Europe resembles modern strains in Asia Minor rather than the recently characterized historical strains from North West Europe. The westward migration of peoples from Central Asia in the first millennium may have introduced different M. leprae strains into medieval Europe and certainly would have facilitated the spread of any existing leprosy. The subsequent decline of M. leprae in Europe may be due to increased host resistance. However, molecular evidence of historical leprosy and tuberculosis co-infections suggests that death from tuberculosis in leprosy patients was also a factor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ancient DNA", "Genotyping", "Human migrations", "Lipid biomarkers", "Mycobacterium leprae", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Europe", "Female", "Genotype", "History, Medieval", "Human Migration", "Humans", "Leprosy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Mycobacterium leprae", "Paleopathology", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923030250", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6701847443": {"Name": "Donoghue H.D.", "AuthorID": "6701847443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "24767991700": {"Name": "O'Grady J.", "AuthorID": "24767991700", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "55242127500": {"Name": "Spigelman M.", "AuthorID": "55242127500", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Anthropology Sackler Medical School, Tel Aviv University"}, "6506138302": {"Name": "Michael Taylor G.", "AuthorID": "6506138302", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172389", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial and Cellular Science, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "55977790700": {"Name": "Marcsik A.", "AuthorID": "55977790700", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "University of Szeged"}, "7103079286": {"Name": "Moln\u00e1r E.", "AuthorID": "7103079286", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "6601976533": {"Name": "P\u00e1lfi G.", "AuthorID": "6601976533", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "7004366473": {"Name": "Pap I.", "AuthorID": "7004366473", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Natural History Museum"}, "56055379400": {"Name": "Teschler-Nicola M.", "AuthorID": "56055379400", "AffiliationID": "60020292", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Natural History Museum"}, "10041187600": {"Name": "Pinhasi R.", "AuthorID": "10041187600", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Earth Institute, Belfield, University College Dublin"}, "7801687441": {"Name": "Erdal Y.S.", "AuthorID": "7801687441", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hacettepe University"}, "8577075400": {"Name": "Velem\u00ednsky P.", "AuthorID": "8577075400", "AffiliationID": "60013134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, National Museum"}, "14023077000": {"Name": "Likovsky J.", "AuthorID": "14023077000", "AffiliationID": "60104328, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Department of the Archaeology of Landscape and Archaeobiology, Institute of Archaeology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "57032263500": {"Name": "Belcastro M.G.", "AuthorID": "57032263500", "AffiliationID": "60073813", "AffiliationName": "Centro Fermi"}, "6602807289": {"Name": "Mariotti V.", "AuthorID": "6602807289", "AffiliationID": "60107062, 60102127, 60046714", "AffiliationName": "ADES, UMR 7268 CNRS/Universit\u00e9 de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e/EFS, Universit\u00e9 de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e"}, "55840563800": {"Name": "Riga A.", "AuthorID": "55840563800", "AffiliationID": "114539606", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio di Bioarcheologia e Osteologia Forense, Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali"}, "7006976224": {"Name": "Rubini M.", "AuthorID": "7006976224", "AffiliationID": "113914397", "AffiliationName": "Anthropological Service of S.B.A.L.
