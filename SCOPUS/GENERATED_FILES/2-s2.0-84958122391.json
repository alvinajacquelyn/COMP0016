Because pharmacokinetic (PK) data are lacking in this population, who very often benefit from therapeutic cooling, which can modify the PK behavior of a drug, a PK study was conducted in term infants with seizures caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Fourteen infants were included, 13 of them being cooled. Forty-nine blood samples were available for the determination of the plasma concentration of bumetanide. Concentration-time data were analyzed by the use of a population approach performed with Monolix Software. Bumetanide was found to follow a 2-compartment model. The mean values were 0.063 L/h for clearance, 0.28 and 0.44 L for the central and peripheral distribution volumes, respectively, and 0.59 L/h for the distribution clearance. Birth body weight explained the interindividual variability of bumetanide clearance via an allometric model. No relationship was found between bumetanide exposure and its efficacy (reduction in seizure burden) or its toxicity (hearing loss). This study describes the first PK model of bumetanide in hypothermia-treated infants with seizures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["central nervous system", "neonatology", "population pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticonvulsants", "Asphyxia", "Bumetanide", "Female", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Pilot Projects", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958122391", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55891061100": {"Name": "Jullien V.", "AuthorID": "55891061100", "AffiliationID": "60030857", "AffiliationName": "Service de Pharmacologie, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou"}, "55628845100": {"Name": "Chiron C.", "AuthorID": "55628845100", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University, CEA"}, "7102680694": {"Name": "Pons G.", "AuthorID": "7102680694", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University, CEA"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60030857", "AffiliationName": "Service de Pharmacologie, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou"}, "6602252366": {"Name": "Pressler R.M.", "AuthorID": "6602252366", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Unit (ICH) and Neonatal Unit (IWH), University College London"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "INFANT Research Centre, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University College Cork"}, "7004322686": {"Name": "Blennow M.", "AuthorID": "7004322686", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Karolinska Institutet, University Hospital"}}}
