This article proposes that the immediacy of the scriptural act gives the reader direct access to the traumatic scene. Through pronounced hybridity and fragmentation, Laurens reproduces in textual form her own experience of trauma. The text is a site which replicates the incomprehensibility of the traumatic encounter in a twofold manner, for both writer and reader. The death of a child as a \u201climit-experience\u201d (Wilson) exceeds the bounds of representation and challenges the strictures of a flowing narrative.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Camille Laurens", "child death", "inexpressibility", "loss", "r\u00e9cit de mort", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069457520", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57210112502": {"Name": "Stroia A.", "AuthorID": "57210112502", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
