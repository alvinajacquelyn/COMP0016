All Rights Reserved.Objective To evaluate the minimum disease burden of prostate cancer at which multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) optimally performs. Methods Between 2006 and 2008, 64 men underwent multiparametric MRI imaging (index test) followed by template prostate mapping biopsy (reference test). Three radiologists independently reported each quadrant of every prostate on a scale of 1 to 5: highly likely benign, likely benign, equivocal, likely malignant, highly likely malignant (\u22653 or \u22654 was considered positive). There were 256 prostate sectors; bootstrapping adjustment was used to account for nonindependence. The target condition indicating cancer on biopsies was varied by changing the maximum cancer core length (MCCL) and total cancer core length (TCCL) within each sector from 1 mm to 10 mm. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for each MCCL and TCCL. Gleason \u22643+3 and Gleason \u22653+4 cancers were analyzed separately. Results Mean age was 62 years (range, 40-76 years), and mean prostate-specific antigen level was 8.2 \u03bcg/L (range, 2.1-43 \u03bcg/L). Fifty percent of quadrants (127 of 256) had prostate cancer, of which 65% (83 of 127) were Gleason \u22643+3. For Gleason \u22643+3, multiparametric MRI had an NPV of \u226595% at an MCCL of \u22655 mm and at a TCCL of \u22657 mm (MRI score \u22653). For Gleason \u22653+4, an NPV of \u226595% was seen at an MCCL of \u22655 mm (MRI score \u22653) and TCCL \u22656 mm. Conclusion Multiparametric MRI may allow areas of the prostate which test negative to avoid biopsy. Whether multiparametric MRI can be used as a \"triage\" test before the first biopsy requires results from ongoing prospective validating cohort studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Endosonography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941423751", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55853879300": {"Name": "Anastasiadis E.", "AuthorID": "55853879300", "AffiliationID": "60008659", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surg. of England"}, "7004357370": {"Name": "Charman S.C.", "AuthorID": "7004357370", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "15836399300": {"Name": "Arumainayagam N.", "AuthorID": "15836399300", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "23104280100": {"Name": "Sohaib A.S.", "AuthorID": "23104280100", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60027057, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}}}
