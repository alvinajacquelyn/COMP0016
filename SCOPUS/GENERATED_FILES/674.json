Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Public Health Association. All rights reserved.Background: Research suggests that policymakers often use personal contacts to find information and advice. However, the main sources of information for public health policymakers are not known. This study aims to describe policymakers' sources of information. A questionnaire survey of public health policymakers across Greater Manchester (GM) was carried out (response rate 48%). All policy actors above Director level involved in public health policy (finding, analyzing or producing information, producing or implementing policy) in GM were included in the sampling frame. Respondents were provided with a list of sources of information and asked which they used (categorical data) and to name specific individuals who acted as sources of information (network data). Data were analyzed using frequencies and network analysis. The most frequently chosen sources of information from the categorical data were NICE, government websites and Directors of Public Health. However, the network data showed that the main sources of information in the network were actually mid-level managers in the NHS, who had no direct expertise in public health. Academics and researchers did not feature in the network. Both survey and network analyses provide useful insights into how policymakers access information. Network analysis offers practical and theoretical contributions to the evidence-based policy debate. Identifying individuals who act as key users and producers of evidence allows academics to target actors likely to use and disseminate their work.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administrative Personnel", "Humans", "Information Seeking Behavior", "Policy Making", "Public Health Practice", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044845368", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37112905200": {"Name": "Oliver K.", "AuthorID": "37112905200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "3 School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "6508311548": {"Name": "de Vocht F.", "AuthorID": "6508311548", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "3 School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "24462055900": {"Name": "Money A.", "AuthorID": "24462055900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "3 School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7102339373": {"Name": "Everett M.", "AuthorID": "7102339373", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "3 School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester"}}}
