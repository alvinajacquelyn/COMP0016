Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdWe have performed whole-exome sequencing in a family trio with a 16-year-old girl suffering of progressive motor neuron disease. There was no family history of the disease and no parental consanguinity. Our exome analysis indicated the proband as a compound heterozygote for two missense variants in the TECPR2 gene according to a recessive mode of inheritance. The TECPR2 gene has been reported as a positive regulator of autophagy which is an essential mechanism for maintaining neuron homeostasis and survival and plays a key role in major adult and pediatric neurodegenerative diseases. Variants in this gene have been found responsible for a recently described form of hereditary spastic paraplegia called SPG49 in two previous reports. We propose that both variants causing amino acid substitution, p.Leu684Val and p.Thr903Met, inherited in trans-phase compound heterozygote form, can be responsible for the phenotype observed in our patient. We also consider the possible contribution of a heterozygous variant in the SPG7 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of variants within the family tree including the patient's unaffected brother.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autophagy", "exome", "missense variant", "motor neuron disease", "TECPR2", "WES"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978906517", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6602288509": {"Name": "Covone A.", "AuthorID": "6602288509", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "8383803700": {"Name": "Fiorillo C.", "AuthorID": "8383803700", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "24333870800": {"Name": "Acquaviva M.", "AuthorID": "24333870800", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "DINOGMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Genova"}, "23969732600": {"Name": "Trucco F.", "AuthorID": "23969732600", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "57194321684": {"Name": "Morana G.", "AuthorID": "57194321684", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7006940720": {"Name": "Ravazzolo R.", "AuthorID": "7006940720", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "DINOGMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Genova"}, "7006089242": {"Name": "Minetti C.", "AuthorID": "7006089242", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "DINOGMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Genova"}}}
