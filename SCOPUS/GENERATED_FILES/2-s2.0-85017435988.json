Different features have been extracted and tested, namely features related to the radar cross-section of the micro-drones, as well as the singular value decomposition and centroid of the micro-Doppler signatures. In particular, the added benefit of using multistatic information in comparison with conventional radar is quantified. Classification performance when identifying the weight of the payload that the drone was carrying while hovering was found to be consistently above 96% using the centroid-based features and multistatic information. For the non-hovering scenarios, classification results with accuracy above 95% were also demonstrated in preliminary tests in discriminating between three different payload weights.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classification performance", "Classification results", "Micro-Doppler", "Multi-static"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017435988", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "22233563100": {"Name": "Borrion H.", "AuthorID": "22233563100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
