To investigate further, full necropsies and determination of summed 25 polychlorinated biphenyls congeners (\u03a3PCBs lipid weight) in blubber were undertaken on 329 UK-stranded female harbour porpoises (1990-2012). In sexually mature females, 25/127 (19.7%) showed direct evidence of reproductive failure (foetal death, aborting, dystocia or stillbirth). A further 21/127 (16.5%) had infections of the reproductive tract or tumours of reproductive tract tissues that could contribute to reproductive failure. Resting mature females (non-lactating or non-pregnant) had significantly higher mean \u03a3PCBs (18.5 mg/kg) than both lactating (7.5 mg/kg) and pregnant females (6 mg/kg), though not significantly different to sexually immature females (14.0 mg/kg). Using multinomial logistic regression models \u03a3PCBs was found to be a significant predictor of mature female reproductive status, adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. Resting females were more likely to have a higher PCB burden. Health status (proxied by \"trauma\" or \"infectious disease\" causes of death) was also a significant predictor, with lactating females (i.e. who successfully reproduced) more likely to be in good health status compared to other individuals. Based on contaminant profiles (>11 mg/kg lipid), at least 29/60 (48%) of resting females had not offloaded their pollutant burden via gestation and primarily lactation. Where data were available, these non-offloading females were previously gravid, which suggests foetal or newborn mortality. Furthermore, a lower pregnancy rate of 50% was estimated for \"healthy\" females that died of traumatic causes of death, compared to other populations. Whether or not PCBs are part of an underlying mechanism, we used individual PCB burdens to show further evidence of reproductive failure in the North-east Atlantic harbour porpoise population, results that should inform conservation management.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Environmental Monitoring", "Female", "Logistic Models", "Phocoena", "Polychlorinated Biphenyls", "Pregnancy", "Reproduction", "United Kingdom", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941753740", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7402779296": {"Name": "Murphy S.", "AuthorID": "7402779296", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6603658704": {"Name": "Deaville R.", "AuthorID": "6603658704", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "15045436600": {"Name": "Perkins M.W.", "AuthorID": "15045436600", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7201502132": {"Name": "Law R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201502132", "AffiliationID": "60016939", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science"}, "7006738308": {"Name": "Jepson P.D.", "AuthorID": "7006738308", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7402350646": {"Name": "Barber J.L.", "AuthorID": "7402350646", "AffiliationID": "60016939", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science"}, "8222147000": {"Name": "Learmonth J.A.", "AuthorID": "8222147000", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Oceanlab, University of Aberdeen"}, "35079268000": {"Name": "Read F.L.", "AuthorID": "35079268000", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Oceanlab, University of Aberdeen"}, "7202450331": {"Name": "Pierce G.J.", "AuthorID": "7202450331", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Oceanlab, University of Aberdeen"}, "55245783300": {"Name": "Brownlow A.", "AuthorID": "55245783300", "AffiliationID": "60107757", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, SRUC Veterinary Services Drummondhill"}, "6603887563": {"Name": "Davison N.", "AuthorID": "6603887563", "AffiliationID": "60107757", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, SRUC Veterinary Services Drummondhill"}, "16304614400": {"Name": "Penrose R.", "AuthorID": "16304614400", "AffiliationID": "115692516", "AffiliationName": "Marine Environmental Monitoring"}}}
