In this work we begin by providing an overview of forward modelling methods, before deriving a linearised diffusion-style model which calculates the first-harmonic modulated flux measured on the boundary of a given domain. We derive and examine the correlation measurement density functions of the model which describe the sensitivity of the modality to perturbations in the optical parameters of interest. Finally, we employ said functions in the development of an adjoint-assisted gradient based image reconstruction method, which ameliorates the computational burden and memory requirements of a traditional Newton-based optimisation approach. We validate our work by performing reconstructions of optical absorption and scattering in two- and three-dimensions using simulated measurements with 1% proportional Gaussian noise, and demonstrate the successful recovery of the parameters to within \u00b15% of their true values when the resolution of the ultrasound raster probing the domain is sufficient to delineate perturbing inclusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acousto-optic effects", "Finite element analysis", "Gradient methods", "Inverse problems", "Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption and scatterings", "Acousto-optic effect", "Computational burden", "Correlation measurement", "Diffusion formulation", "Image reconstruction methods", "Optical properties of biological tissues", "Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography", "Finite Element Analysis", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Models, Theoretical", "Tomography, Optical", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959373372", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7202111031": {"Name": "Leung T.", "AuthorID": "7202111031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
