In smart cities, numerous IoT-based services are likely to be available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the environment's services and their functionalities as Semantic Web Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of IoT domains. In this paper, we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature, specification (i.e., context-aware pre-conditions, post-conditions and effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Internet of Things", "Real-time and semantic web services", "Service modeling", "Smart cities", "Smart environments", "Smart services", "System design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Composition frameworks", "Context aware services", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Real time", "Semantic Service Oriented Architecture", "Service Model", "Smart environment", "Smart services"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010972095", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"24832431600": {"Name": "Urbieta A.", "AuthorID": "24832431600", "AffiliationID": "60032207", "AffiliationName": "IK4-Ikerlan Technology Research Centre, Information and Communication Technologies Area"}, "23396745000": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Beltr\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "23396745000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford e-Research Centre"}, "13103948100": {"Name": "Ben Mokhtar S.", "AuthorID": "13103948100", "AffiliationID": "60108341, 60016253", "AffiliationName": "INSA de Lyon, LIRIS, DRIM Research Group"}, "57191514594": {"Name": "Anwar Hossain M.", "AuthorID": "57191514594", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "King Saud University, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Department of Software Engineering"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}}}
