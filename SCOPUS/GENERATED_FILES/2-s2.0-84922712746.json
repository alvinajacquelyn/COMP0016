Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background & Aims: To perform a comprehensive study on independent modulators of liver fibrosis progression and determinants of portal pressure considering immune status, insulin resistance (IR), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, genetic variants of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) and interleukin 28B (IL28B) in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV/hepatitis C-coinfected (HIV/HCV) patients. Patients & Methods: 25(OH)D deficiency (25(OH)DDEF), IR and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte nadir (lowCD4NAD) were defined as 25(OH)D <20 ng \u00d7 ml-1, HOMA-IR >2 and CD4nadir <200 cells \u00d7 \u03bcl-1 respectively. Liver fibrosis progression rate (FPR) was calculated as METAVIR F units divided by the number of years since HCV infection. Patients with a FPR > median FPR were assigned to the highFPR group. Results: Among 86 HIV/HCV, the median FPR was 0.167 units \u00d7 years-1. While the prevalence of prior alcohol abuse, lowCD4NAD and 25(OH)DDEF was higher among highFPR patients, the prevalence of IR was comparable. The association between 25(OH)DDEF and FPR was confirmed in a subgroup of patients with METAVIR stage F0/F1/F2 in which 25(OH)D levels are not affected by the severity of liver disease. The distribution of IL28B C/C and PNPLA3 non-C/C was similar, while PNPLA3 G/G was exclusively observed in highFPR patients. LowCD4NAD (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.05-8.24; P = 0.039) and 25(OH)DDEF (OR: 5.62; 95% CI: 2.05-15.38; P = 0.001) were independently associated with highFPR and showed an additive effect. Portal pressure correlated with prior alcohol abuse, HCV-genotype 3, CD4+ nadir and 25(OH)D levels. Conclusions: Two potentially modifiable factors, CD4+ nadir and 25(OH)D levels, were both independent modulators of liver fibrosis progression and determinants of portal pressure. Further studies are warranted to assess the relevance of PNPLA3 for FPR in HIV/HCV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic hepatitis C", "Cirrhosis", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "Liver fibrosis", "Portal hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Coinfection", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Genotype", "Hepatitis C", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Interleukins", "Lipase", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Portal Pressure", "Retrospective Studies", "Vitamin D"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922712746", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "36159797500": {"Name": "Payer B.", "AuthorID": "36159797500", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "56222229100": {"Name": "Steiner S.", "AuthorID": "56222229100", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "6603727095": {"Name": "Ferlitsch A.", "AuthorID": "6603727095", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "36769160400": {"Name": "St\u00e4ttermayer A.", "AuthorID": "36769160400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7101836598": {"Name": "Ferenci P.", "AuthorID": "7101836598", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "7004157033": {"Name": "Peck-Radosavljevic M.", "AuthorID": "7004157033", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "26427980300": {"Name": "Aichelburg M.", "AuthorID": "26427980300", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36058937000": {"Name": "Grabmeier-Pfistershammer K.", "AuthorID": "36058937000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603774236": {"Name": "Obermayer-Pietsch B.", "AuthorID": "6603774236", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Graz"}}}
