Students in the experimental group engaged in weekly dyadic conversation exchanges with native speakers in the United States via telecommunication tools. The native speaker interlocutors were trained to provide interactional feedback (recasts) when the nonnative speakers\u2019 utterances hindered successful understanding (i.e., negotiation for comprehensibility). The students in the comparison group received regular foreign language instruction without any interaction with native speakers. The coded video data showed that the experimental students worked on improving all linguistic domains of language, likely in response to their native speaker interlocutors\u2019 interactional feedback (recasts, negotiation) during the treatment. The pretest\u2013posttest data of the students\u2019 spontaneous production showed that they made significant gains in the dimensions of comprehensibility, fluency, and lexicogrammar but not in those of accentedness and pronunciation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fluency", "grammar", "interaction", "listening", "pronunciation", "second language speech", "vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992751111", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57002318600": {"Name": "Akiyama Y.", "AuthorID": "57002318600", "AffiliationID": "60023927", "AffiliationName": "Georgetown University"}}}
