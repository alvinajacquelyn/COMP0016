Pyroptosis is a novel form of cell death in which caspase 1 is activated and cleaves interleukin 1\u03b2. VX-785 is a highly selective, prodrug caspase 1 inhibitor that is also clinically available. It has been shown to be protective against acute IR in vivo rat model, and therefore might be a promising possibility for future cardioprotective therapy. However, it is not known whether protection by VX-765 involves the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway. We therefore investigated whether VX-765 protects the isolated, perfused rat heart via the PI3K/Akt pathway and whether protection was additive with ischaemic preconditioning (IPC). Methods: Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subject to ischaemia and reperfusion injury in the presence of 30 \u03bcM VX-765, with precedent IPC, or the combination of VX-765 and IPC. Results: VX-765 reduced infarct size (28 vs 48% control; P < 0.05) to a similar extent as IPC (30%; P < 0.05). The PI3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the protective effect of VX-765. Importantly in the model used, we were unable to show additive protection with VX-765 + IPC. Conclusions: The caspase 1 inhibitor, VX-765, was able to reduce myocardial infarction in a model of IR injury. However, the addition of IPC did not demonstrate any further protection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caspase", "Infarction", "Ischaemic", "Kinases", "Reperfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caspase 1", "Caspase Inhibitors", "Cytoprotection", "Dipeptides", "Disease Models, Animal", "Isolated Heart Preparation", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Myocardium", "para-Aminobenzoates", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Pyroptosis", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044445959", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56647993000": {"Name": "Do Carmo H.", "AuthorID": "56647993000", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion, Faculty of Medical Science, State University of Campinas\u2013UNICAMP"}, "53876771800": {"Name": "Arjun S.", "AuthorID": "53876771800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "24336430800": {"Name": "Petrucci O.", "AuthorID": "24336430800", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion, Faculty of Medical Science, State University of Campinas\u2013UNICAMP"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}}}
