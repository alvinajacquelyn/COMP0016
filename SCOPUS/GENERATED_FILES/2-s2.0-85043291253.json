Signal processing has previously been developed for single element transducers. Here, the processing methods for acoustic resolution PAF using a clinical ultrasound transducer array are developed and validated using a 64-element transducer array with a -6 dB detection band of 11 to 17 MHz. Measurements were performed on a flow phantom consisting of a tube (580 \u03bcm inner diameter) perfused with human blood flowing at physiological speeds ranging from 3 to 25 mm / s. The processing pipeline comprised: image reconstruction, filtering, displacement detection, and masking. High-pass filtering and background subtraction were found to be key preprocessing steps to enable accurate flow velocity estimates, which were calculated using a cross-correlation based method. In addition, the regions of interest in the calculated velocity maps were defined using a masking approach based on the amplitude of the cross-correlation functions. These developments enabled blood flow measurements using a transducer array, bringing PAF one step closer to clinical applicability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood flow", "cross correlation", "flowmetry", "image processing", "masking", "photoacoustic Doppler effect", "transducer array"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Cross correlations", "Cross-correlation function", "Displacement detection", "Flowmetry", "Single element transducers", "Transducer array", "Ultrasound transducer arrays", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Laser-Doppler Flowmetry", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Transducers", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043291253", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57194206758": {"Name": "B\u00fccking T.", "AuthorID": "57194206758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "21734010500": {"Name": "Brunker J.", "AuthorID": "21734010500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55744532100": {"Name": "Van Den Berg P.", "AuthorID": "55744532100", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "University of Twente, MIRA Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine"}, "36891977500": {"Name": "Steenbergen W.", "AuthorID": "36891977500", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "University of Twente, MIRA Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine"}, "6602671760": {"Name": "Balabani S.", "AuthorID": "6602671760", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mechanical Engineering"}}}
