Here, we present a framework for assessing three components of climate-related risk for species: vulnerability, exposure and hazard. We used the relationship between the observed response of species to climate change and a set of intrinsic traits (e.g. weaning age) and extrinsic factors (e.g. precipitation seasonality within a species geographic range) to predict, respectively, the vulnerability and exposure of all data-sufficient terrestrial non-volant mammals (3,953 species). Combining this information with hazard (the magnitude of projected climate change within a species geographic range), we identified global hotspots of species at risk from climate change that includes the western Amazon basin, south-western Kenya, north-eastern Tanzania, north-eastern South Africa, Yunnan province in China, and mountain chains in Papua-New Guinea. Our framework identifies priority areas for monitoring climate change effects on species and directing climate mitigation actions for biodiversity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate change", "exposure", "extinction risk", "hazard", "hotspots", "life-history traits", "mammals", "vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "Climate Change", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Mammals", "Models, Biological", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033722832", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"56533505100": {"Name": "Pacifici M.", "AuthorID": "56533505100", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Global Mammal Assessment Program, Department of Biology and Biotechnologies, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"}, "6506118014": {"Name": "Rondinini C.", "AuthorID": "6506118014", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Global Mammal Assessment Program, Department of Biology and Biotechnologies, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"}, "26647965400": {"Name": "Visconti P.", "AuthorID": "26647965400", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
