Previous simulation studies of blood vessel growth based on the cellular Potts model proposed that elongated, adhesive or mutually attractive endothelial cells suffice for the formation of blood vessel sprouts and vascular networks. Because each mathematical representation of a model introduces potential artifacts, it is important that model results are reproduced using alternative modeling paradigms. Here, we present a lattice-free, particle-based simulation of the cell elongation model of vasculogenesis. The new, particle-based simulations confirm the results obtained from the previous cellular Potts simulations. Furthermore, our current findings suggest that the emergence of order is possible with the application of a high enough attractive force or, alternatively, a longer attraction radius. The methodology will be applicable to a range of problems in morphogenesis and noisy particle aggregation in which cell shape is a key determining factor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alignment order", "Cell elongation", "Cell-based model", "Morphogenesis", "Vasculogenesis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959199947", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"56711271700": {"Name": "Palachanis D.", "AuthorID": "56711271700", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "56740062600": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3 A.", "AuthorID": "56740062600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "10038963900": {"Name": "Merks R.", "AuthorID": "10038963900", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, Leiden University"}}}
