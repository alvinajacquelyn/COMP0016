As such there is a lack of reliable, experimentally verified metabolic pathways in databases and databases are forced to predict all but the most immediately useful pathways. Text-mining has the potential to solve this problem, but while sophisticated text-mining methods have been developed to assist the curation of many types of biomedical networks, such as protein-protein interaction networks, the mining of metabolic pathways from the literature has been largely neglected by the text-mining community. In this chapter we describe a pipeline for the extraction of metabolic pathways built on freely available open-source components and a heuristic metabolic reaction extraction algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Information extraction", "Metabolic interaction extraction", "Metabolic pathway", "Named entity recognition", "Natural language processing", "Text-mining"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Computational Biology", "Data Mining", "Humans", "Natural Language Processing", "Protein Binding"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000613300", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57192195139": {"Name": "Czarnecki J.M.", "AuthorID": "57192195139", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "36118495000": {"Name": "Shepherd A.J.", "AuthorID": "36118495000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck University of London"}}}
