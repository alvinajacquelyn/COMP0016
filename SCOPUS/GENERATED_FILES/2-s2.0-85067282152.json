The experiences of those receiving inpatient treatment for EDs are well-documented in western samples, but less is known about the experiences of those in China, the world's most populous country in which the incidence of EDs may be increasing. Methods: This qualitative study aimed to use Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to understand the experiences of four adolescents receiving inpatient treatment for EDs in China. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results: Four themes emerged from the data: perceptions of the treatment received, peer influences during admission, the impact of treatment on wellbeing and participants' sense of self. Conclusions: This is the first published study on the experience of Chinese participants with EDs. Their experiences share commonalities with those reported by participants in Western studies and also illuminate differences in how EDs are understood and managed in inpatient settings in China. Cross-cultural collaborations will be important to share knowledge and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "China", "Eating disorders", "Inpatient treatment", "Patient experience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067282152", "SubjectAreas": [["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57209303367": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57209303367", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "35179313900": {"Name": "Harrison A.", "AuthorID": "35179313900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
