There remains, however, concern that its short-term benefits are accompanied by long-term adverse effects e.g. poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. Objective Our aim was to determine the effects of administration of postnatal dexamethasone on respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age after adjusting for neonatal and infant risk factors. Materials and methods The study included 412 infants born at 23\u201328 weeks of gestation, 29% had received postnatal dexamethasone. Two outcomes were examined, respiratory hospital admissions in the past 12 months and neurodevelopmental impairment. Logistic regression, adjusted for sex, birthweight z-score, gestation, maternal smoking, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks, airleak, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary haemorrhage, major ultrasound abnormality, mode of ventilation and age at assessment, was undertaken. Results After adjustment, postnatal dexamethasone was associated with significantly increased proportions of both respiratory hospital readmission: (0.35 vs 0.15, difference = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.31) and neurodevelopmental impairment (0.59 vs 0.45, difference = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.26). Conclusions Postnatal dexamethasone use in extremely preterm infants is associated with increased risks of respiratory hospital admissions and neurodevelopmental impairment. These associations were not explained by excess neonatal morbidities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Dexamethasone", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Pregnancy", "Respiration Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030427821", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195950047": {"Name": "Qin G.", "AuthorID": "57195950047", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "55636391300": {"Name": "Lo J.W.", "AuthorID": "55636391300", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychiatry, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales"}, "35548124700": {"Name": "Peacock J.L.", "AuthorID": "35548124700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health and Social Care Research, King\u2019s College London"}, "57189580321": {"Name": "Greenough A.", "AuthorID": "57189580321", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King\u2019s College London"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57213449631": {"Name": "Calvert S.A.", "AuthorID": "57213449631", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Health, St George\u2019s University of London"}}}
