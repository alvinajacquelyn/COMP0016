To facilitate these secondary uses of routinely collected patient data, it is beneficial to know what data elements are captured in clinical trials. Therefore our aim here is to determine the most commonly used data elements in clinical trials and their availability in hospital EHR systems. Methods: Case report forms for 23 clinical trials in differing disease areas were analyzed. Through an iterative and consensus-based process of medical informatics professionals from academia and trial experts from the European pharmaceutical industry, data elements were compiled for all disease areas and with special focus on the reporting of adverse events. Afterwards, data elements were identified and statistics acquired from hospital sites providing data to the EHR4CR project. Results: The analysis identified 133 unique data elements. Fifty elements were congruent with a published data inventory for patient recruitment and 83 new elements were identified for clinical trial execution, including adverse event reporting. Demographic and laboratory elements lead the list of available elements in hospitals EHR systems. For the reporting of serious adverse events only very few elements could be identified in the patient records. Conclusions: Common data elements in clinical trials have been identified and their availability in hospital systems elucidated. Several elements, often those related to reimbursement, are frequently available whereas more specialized elements are ranked at the bottom of the data inventory list. Hospitals that want to obtain the benefits of reusing data for research from their EHR are now able to prioritize their efforts based on this common data element list.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials", "Common data elements", "Data quality", "Electronic health records", "Metadata", "Secondary use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems", "Biomedical Research", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Common Data Elements", "Electronic Health Records", "Europe", "Health Information Exchange", "Hospital Records", "Humans", "Medical Informatics", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002567422", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"55256345300": {"Name": "Bruland P.", "AuthorID": "55256345300", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "56002382300": {"Name": "Doods J.", "AuthorID": "56002382300", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "55550317000": {"Name": "Dugas M.", "AuthorID": "55550317000", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "6603419835": {"Name": "McGilchrist M.", "AuthorID": "6603419835", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "University of Dundee"}, "6602516627": {"Name": "Zapletal E.", "AuthorID": "6602516627", "AffiliationID": "60030857, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement d'Informatique Hospitali\u00e8re, AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou"}, "12752676200": {"Name": "Acosta D.", "AuthorID": "12752676200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CHIME, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "56481563300": {"Name": "Proeve J.", "AuthorID": "56481563300", "AffiliationID": "60006680", "AffiliationName": "Previously Bayer Healthcare"}, "57192269834": {"Name": "Askin S.", "AuthorID": "57192269834", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "6602762221": {"Name": "Ganslandt T.", "AuthorID": "6602762221", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Medical Informatics, University of Erlangen/Nuremberg"}}}
