HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses decline following cART initiation. Alterations in other HIV-specific immune responses that may assist in eliminating latent HIV infection, specifically antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), are unclear. Methods A cohort of 49 cART-naive HIV-infected subjects from Thailand (mean baseline CD4 count, 188 cells/\u03bcL; mean viral load, 5.4 log<inf>10</inf> copies/mL) was followed for 96 weeks after initiating cART. ADCC and ADP assays were performed using serum samples obtained at baseline and after 96 weeks of cART. Results A 35% reduction in HIV type 1 envelope (Env)-specific ADCC-mediated killing of target cells (P <. 001) was observed after 96 weeks of cART. This was corroborated by a significant reduction in the ability of Env-specific ADCC antibodies to activate natural killer cells (P <. 001). Significantly reduced ADP was also observed after 96 weeks of cART (P =. 018). Conclusions This longitudinal study showed that cART resulted in significant reductions of HIV-specific effector antibody responses, including ADCC and ADP. Therapeutic vaccines or other immunomodulatory approaches may be required to improve antibody-mediated control of HIV during cART.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADCC", "ADP", "cART", "HIV", "monocytes", "NK cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity", "Cohort Studies", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Longitudinal Studies", "Monocytes", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922470066", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55495994000": {"Name": "Madhavi V.", "AuthorID": "55495994000", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "56195001400": {"Name": "Ana-Sosa-Batiz F.E.", "AuthorID": "56195001400", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "55053396400": {"Name": "Jegaskanda S.", "AuthorID": "55053396400", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "57196316443": {"Name": "Center R.J.", "AuthorID": "57196316443", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "6506165256": {"Name": "Winnall W.R.", "AuthorID": "6506165256", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "35223771900": {"Name": "Parsons M.S.", "AuthorID": "35223771900", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "8599964100": {"Name": "Stratov I.", "AuthorID": "8599964100", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "22951377100": {"Name": "Kramski M.", "AuthorID": "22951377100", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "7201914639": {"Name": "Kent S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201914639", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "36078697200": {"Name": "Cooper D.A.", "AuthorID": "36078697200", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, University of New South Wales"}, "7006091312": {"Name": "Kelleher A.D.", "AuthorID": "7006091312", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, University of New South Wales"}, "52163677500": {"Name": "Hsu D.", "AuthorID": "52163677500", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, University of New South Wales"}, "7004714193": {"Name": "Pett S.", "AuthorID": "7004714193", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35228696200": {"Name": "Ananworanich J.", "AuthorID": "35228696200", "AffiliationID": "60016965, 60031780", "AffiliationName": "Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, HIV Netherlands Australia Thailand Research Collaboration"}}}
