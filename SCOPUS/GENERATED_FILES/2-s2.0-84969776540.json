Based on design anthropology methodology, the political role of urban design in the production of aesthetic objects and landscapes that signify the control over individuals and communities will be explored. As this paper suggests, such a new form of political influence is hidden beneath an aesthetic and user-oriented fa\u00e7ade, making it even more dangerous than previous more direct actions, such as gated communities separated from public space by stone walls. The paper\u2019s interdisciplinary approach that is rooted in anthropology, design, architecture and politics will also point out some similarities between specific sites that are often considered different, namely Tel Aviv\u2019s global and privatized gated communities on the one hand and the unrecognized Bedouin villages in the peripheral Negev region on the other. It will be argued that these similarities are the product of the politics of militarization, privatization and social fragmentation that are translated into urban design practices from \u2018above\u2019 via state and municipal planning policy as well as formal design, and from \u2018below\u2019 through informal and often unauthorized construction initiated by marginalized communities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969776540", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"8632963600": {"Name": "Yacobi H.", "AuthorID": "8632963600", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and Government, Ben Gurion University of the Negev"}, "25823412300": {"Name": "Ventura J.", "AuthorID": "25823412300", "AffiliationID": "60072445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Inclusive Design, Hadassah Academic College"}, "57189358398": {"Name": "Danzig S.", "AuthorID": "57189358398", "AffiliationID": "116277612", "AffiliationName": "Independent Researcher"}}}
