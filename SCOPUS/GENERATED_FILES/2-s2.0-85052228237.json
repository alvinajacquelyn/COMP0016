All Rights Reserved.Gentamicin is a common antibiotic used in neonates and infants. A recently published population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed using data from multiple studies, and the objective of our analyses was to evaluate the feasibility of using a national electronic health record (EHR) database for further external evaluation of this model. Our results suggest that, with proper data capture procedures, EHR data can serve as a potential data source for external evaluation of PK models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EHR", "External evaluation", "Gentamicin", "Infant", "Pediatrics", "Pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Databases, Factual", "Electronic Health Records", "Female", "Gentamicins", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052228237", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55834209600": {"Name": "Ge S.", "AuthorID": "55834209600", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "57197782850": {"Name": "Beechinor R.J.", "AuthorID": "57197782850", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "7202949828": {"Name": "Gonzalez D.", "AuthorID": "7202949828", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "25639684100": {"Name": "Hornik C.P.", "AuthorID": "25639684100", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "56001965300": {"Name": "Zimmerman K.", "AuthorID": "56001965300", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "15836932700": {"Name": "Cohen-Wolkowiez M.", "AuthorID": "15836932700", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation, Infection, and Rheumatology Section, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56999219600": {"Name": "Laughon M.M.", "AuthorID": "56999219600", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "7406321427": {"Name": "Clark R.", "AuthorID": "7406321427", "AffiliationID": "60001962", "AffiliationName": "Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc."}}}
