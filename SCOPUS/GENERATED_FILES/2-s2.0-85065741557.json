The most commonly used precursor is trimethylaluminum, which is highly reactive and pyrophoric. In the purpose of searching for a more ideal Al source, the non-pyrophoric aluminum tri-sec-butoxide ([Al(OsBu)3], ATSB) was introduced as a novel precursor for atomic layer deposition (ALD). After demonstrating the deposition of Al2O3 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and 'pulsed CVD' routes, the use of ATSB in an atomic layer deposition (ALD)-like process was investigated and optimized to achieve self-limiting growth. The films were characterized using spectral reflectance, ellipsometry and UV-Vis before their composition was studied. The growth rate of Al2O3 via the ALD-like process was consistently 0.12 nm/cycle on glass, silicon and quartz substrates under the optimized conditions. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images of the ALD-deposited Al2O3 films deposited on complex nanostructures demonstrated the conformity, uniformity and good thickness control of these films, suggesting a potential of being used as the protection layer in photoelectrochemical water splitting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aluminum oxide", "Aluminum tri-sec-butoxide", "Atomic layer deposition", "Chemical vapor deposition", "Thin film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aluminum tri-sec-butoxide", "Chemical vapor depositions (CVD)", "Complex nanostructures", "Optimized conditions", "Photoelectrochemical water splitting", "Self-limiting growths", "Spectral reflectances", "Transmission electron microscopy images"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065741557", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57208152288": {"Name": "Xia X.", "AuthorID": "57208152288", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57201695936": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57201695936", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57208761324": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "57208761324", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
