To roll out such an intervention, understanding locale-specific knowledge barriers is critical. In this study, we measured knowledge of HIV serodiscordance, transmission, and prevention before and after receipt of CVCT services in Durban. Design: Pre- and post-CVCT knowledge surveys were administered to a selection of individuals seeking CVCT services. Methods: Changes in knowledge scores were assessed with McNemar Chi-square tests for balanced data and generalized estimating equation methods for unbalanced data. Results: The survey included 317 heterosexual black couples (634 individuals) who were primarily Zulu (87%), unemployed (47%), and had at least a secondary level education (78%). 28% of couples proved to be discordant. Only 30% of individuals thought serodiscordance between couples was possible pre-CVCT compared to 95% post-CVCT. One-third thought there was at least one benefit of CVCT pre-CVCT, increasing to 96% post-CVCT. Overall, there were positive changes in knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention. However, many respondents thought all HIV positive mothers give birth to babies with AIDS (64% pre-CVCT, 59% post-CVCT) and that male circumcision does not protect negative men against HIV (70% pre-CVCT, 67% post-CVCT). Conclusions: CVCT was well received and was followed by improvements in understanding of discordance, the benefits of joint testing, and HIV transmission. Country-level health messaging would benefit from targeting gaps in knowledge about serodiscordance, vertical transmission, and male circumcision.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "AIDS Serodiagnosis", "Counseling", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "South Africa", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928919805", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35176223600": {"Name": "Kilembe W.", "AuthorID": "35176223600", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "8954824900": {"Name": "Wall K.M.", "AuthorID": "8954824900", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Laney Graduate School, Emory University"}, "56623092100": {"Name": "Mwaanga A.", "AuthorID": "56623092100", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "56223940300": {"Name": "Dissen E.", "AuthorID": "56223940300", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "56622898800": {"Name": "Phiri H.", "AuthorID": "56622898800", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "56623017000": {"Name": "Sakulanda J.", "AuthorID": "56623017000", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "42661222100": {"Name": "Davitte J.", "AuthorID": "42661222100", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "55822964344": {"Name": "Allen S.", "AuthorID": "55822964344", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "54795624100": {"Name": "Mokgoro M.", "AuthorID": "54795624100", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "56623092800": {"Name": "Kamusoko M.", "AuthorID": "56623092800", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for Tuberculosis and HIV (K-RITH), University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7102586351": {"Name": "Reddy T.", "AuthorID": "7102586351", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Biostatistics Unit"}, "6701840797": {"Name": "Brockman M.", "AuthorID": "6701840797", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences and Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University"}}}
