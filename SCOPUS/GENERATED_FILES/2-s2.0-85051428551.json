All rights reserved.Silver-containing nanomaterials are of interest for their antibiotic properties, for a wide range of applications from medicine to consumer products. However, much remains to be learnt about the degradation of such materials and their effects on human health. While most analyses involve measurement of total silver levels, it is important also to be able to measure concentrations of active free Ag(I) ions. We report here the preparation of a coumarin-based probe, thiocoumarin silver sensor 1 (TcAg1), that responds reversibly to the addition of silver ions through the appearance of a new fluorescence emission peak at 565 nm. Importantly, this peak is not observed in the presence of Hg(II), a common interferent in Ag(I) sensing. To establish the utility of this sensor, we prepared silver-doped phosphate glasses with demonstrated bactericidal properties, and observed the Ag(I) release from these glasses in solutions of different ionic strength. TcAg1 is therefore a useful tool for the study of the environmental and medical effects of silver-containing materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibacterial", "fluorescent probe", "phosphate glass", "Silver"], "IndexKeywords": ["antibacterial", "Antibiotic property", "Bactericidal properties", "Fluorescence emission peaks", "Fluorescent probes", "Human health", "Measure concentration", "Phosphate glass", "Bacteria", "Candida albicans", "Coumarins", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Silver", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051428551", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57195728197": {"Name": "Lim Z.", "AuthorID": "57195728197", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "55722963000": {"Name": "Smith D.", "AuthorID": "55722963000", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "55698876100": {"Name": "Kolanowski J.", "AuthorID": "55698876100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57203373158": {"Name": "Mattison R.", "AuthorID": "57203373158", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "16642962700": {"Name": "New E.", "AuthorID": "16642962700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney Nano Institute, University of Sydney"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science, BK21 Plus NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University"}, "57203373078": {"Name": "Baek S.", "AuthorID": "57203373078", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57191871297": {"Name": "Chrzanowski W.", "AuthorID": "57191871297", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney Nano Institute, University of Sydney"}}}
