The paper commences by considering evidence on the economic value of older people to society. This shows that older people make a net contribution through expenditure in shops, employment, voluntary work, childcare and taxation which exceeds their cost to the taxpayer. The assumptions underlying the calculations are examined and found to be robust. The patterns of travel of older people are examined and found to be consistent with the estimates of the economic contribution of older people. Mobility provides many intrinsic benefits for older people, facilitating independence, reducing social isolation and physical activity. Evidence from the examples of the ability to drive and providing free bus travel is considered. Then the contribution of older people to society in future is examined and how travel contributes to this. It is shown that changes in older people[U+05F3]s mobility would affect their contribution to society. Ways in which the mobility of older people could be increased are identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accessibility", "Concessionary travel", "Mobility", "Older people", "Society"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961288512", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7004586354": {"Name": "Mackett R.", "AuthorID": "7004586354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
