The method owes its success partly to the fact that many materials can form crystals; however, it is difficult to know beforehand which specific conditions could facilitate their formation. Thus, optimal crystallization conditions are determined by gradually changing the buffer composition, temperature, and pressure in a trial-and-error manner. Considering how time consuming and costly such an approach is, the field would greatly benefit from knowing how external conditions determine the stability and specific symmetry of given biomolecular crystals, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the crystallization process. Computational methods\u2014such as molecular dynamics simulations\u2014show great potential in this respect, and by studying the behavior of DNA in crystals and the effects crystallization additives have on crystal stability, we lay the foundation for such studies.\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.X-ray crystallography is the primary tool for biomolecular structural determination. However, contacts formed through the crystal lattice are known to affect structures, especially for small and flexible molecules such as DNA oligomers, by introducing significant structural changes in comparison to solution. Furthermore, why molecules crystallize in certain symmetry groups, which role crystallization additives play, and whether they are just innocuous and unspecific crystallization catalysts remain unclear. By using one of the currently best-performing DNA force fields and applying significant computational effort, we described the nature of intermolecular forces that stabilize B-DNA crystals in various symmetry groups and solvent environments with an unprecedented level of detail. We showed a tight coupling between the lattice stability and the type of crystallization additives and that certain symmetry groups are stable only in the presence of a specific additive. Additives and crystal contacts induce small but non-negligible changes in the physical properties of DNA.\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.Although X-ray crystallography is the most commonly used method for biomolecular structure determination, it is still unclear how stable crystals form. By using computational modeling of known crystal forms of the Drew-Dickerson dodecamer, we reveal the nature of intermolecular forces leading to stable crystals. We also explore the effects of crystallizing agents, highlighting the role of spermine in the stabilization of specific space groups. Lastly, we describe the difference in biophysical properties of DNA in solution and crystals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["additives", "crystallization", "crystallizing agents", "DNA crystals", "molecular dynamics simulations", "SDG3: Good health and well-being", "spermine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062530692", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"36463799200": {"Name": "Kuzmanic A.", "AuthorID": "36463799200", "AffiliationID": "60002016", "AffiliationName": "Joint BSC-IRB Research Program in Computational Biology"}, "25931363700": {"Name": "Dans P.D.", "AuthorID": "25931363700", "AffiliationID": "60002016", "AffiliationName": "Joint BSC-IRB Research Program in Computational Biology"}, "7102809158": {"Name": "Orozco M.", "AuthorID": "7102809158", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Barcelona"}}}
