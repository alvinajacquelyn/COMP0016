Although both macro-fossils and micro-fossils of rice have been recovered from the Early Neolithic site of Shangshan, dating to more than 10,000 years before present (BP), we report evidence of phytolith and starch microfossils taken from stone tools, both for grinding and cutting, and cultural layers, that indicating barnyard grass (Echinochloa spp.) was a major subsistence resource, alongside smaller quantities of acorn starches (Lithocarpus/Quercus sensu lato) and water chestnuts (Trapa). This evidence suggests that early managed wetland environments were initially harvested for multiple grain species including barnyard grasses as well as rice, and indicate that the emergence of rice as the favoured cultivated grass and ultimately the key domesticate of the Yangtze basin was a protracted process.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Archaeology", "China", "Echinochloa", "Eleocharis", "Oryza", "Poaceae", "Wetlands"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946615291", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7406503685": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "7406503685", "AffiliationID": "60031150, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab. of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55668088600": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "55668088600", "AffiliationID": "60031150, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab. of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57142893100": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57142893100", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55479161600": {"Name": "Ma Z.", "AuthorID": "55479161600", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55618106900": {"Name": "Zhuang Y.", "AuthorID": "55618106900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55668063900": {"Name": "Huan X.", "AuthorID": "55668063900", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55919952500": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55919952500", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36192946400": {"Name": "Ge Y.", "AuthorID": "36192946400", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7404843246": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "7404843246", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "12767044300": {"Name": "Perry L.", "AuthorID": "12767044300", "AffiliationID": "60018319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Geoinformation Science, Center for Earth Observing and Space Research, George Mason University"}, "23466731600": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "23466731600", "AffiliationID": "100506925", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology"}}}
