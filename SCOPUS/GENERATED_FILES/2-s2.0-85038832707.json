European Journal of Heart Failure \u00a9 2017 European Society of CardiologyDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents a particular aetiology of systolic heart failure that frequently has a genetic background and usually affects young patients with few co-morbidities. The prognosis of DCM has improved substantially during the last decades due to more accurate aetiological characterization, the red-flag integrated approach to the disease, early diagnosis through systematic familial screening, and the concept of DCM as a dynamic disease requiring constant optimization of medical and non-pharmacological evidence-based treatments. However, some important issues in clinical management remain unresolved, including the role of cardiac magnetic resonance for diagnosis and risk categorization and the interaction between genotype and clinical phenotype, and arrhythmic risk stratification. This review offers a comprehensive survey of these and other emerging issues in the clinical management of DCM, providing where possible practical recommendations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dilated cardiomyopathy", "Genetics", "Heart failure", "Left ventricular reverse remodelling", "Risk stratification", "Sudden cardiac death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Disease Management", "Early Diagnosis", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038832707", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"23768475100": {"Name": "Merlo M.", "AuthorID": "23768475100", "AffiliationID": "60018363, 60001138", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Department \u2018Ospedali Riuniti\u2019 and University of Trieste"}, "56950331100": {"Name": "Cannat\u00e0 A.", "AuthorID": "56950331100", "AffiliationID": "60018363, 60001138", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Department \u2018Ospedali Riuniti\u2019 and University of Trieste"}, "57004575500": {"Name": "Gobbo M.", "AuthorID": "57004575500", "AffiliationID": "60018363, 60001138", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Department \u2018Ospedali Riuniti\u2019 and University of Trieste"}, "31067487400": {"Name": "Stolfo D.", "AuthorID": "31067487400", "AffiliationID": "60018363, 60001138", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Department \u2018Ospedali Riuniti\u2019 and University of Trieste"}, "7005062509": {"Name": "Sinagra G.", "AuthorID": "7005062509", "AffiliationID": "60018363, 60001138", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Department \u2018Ospedali Riuniti\u2019 and University of Trieste"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Muscle Disease, Institute of Cardiological Sciences, University College London and St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
