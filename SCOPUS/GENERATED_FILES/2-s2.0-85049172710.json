The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Sunquakes are created by the hydrodynamic response of the lower atmosphere to a sudden deposition of energy and momentum. In this study, we investigate a sunquake that occurred in NOAA active region 11675 on 2013 February 17. Observations of the corona, chromosphere, and photosphere are brought together for the first time with a nonlinear force-free model of the active region's magnetic field in order to probe the magnetic environment in which the sunquake was initiated. We find that the sunquake was associated with the destabilization of a flux rope and an associated M-class GOES flare. Active region 11675 was in its emergence phase at the time of the sunquake and photospheric motions caused by the emergence heavily modified the flux rope and its associated quasi-separatrix layers, eventually triggering the flux rope's instability. The flux rope was surrounded by an extended envelope of field lines rooted in a small area at the approximate position of the sunquake. We argue that the configuration of the envelope, by interacting with the expanding flux rope, created a \u201cmagnetic lens\u201d that may have focussed energy on one particular location of the photosphere, creating the necessary conditions for the initiation of the sunquake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Sun: activity", "Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)", "Sun: flares", "Sun: helioseismology", "Sun: magnetic fields", "Sun: photosphere"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049172710", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7401917508": {"Name": "Green L.M.", "AuthorID": "7401917508", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "22954929800": {"Name": "Valori G.", "AuthorID": "22954929800", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "55323669300": {"Name": "Zuccarello F.P.", "AuthorID": "55323669300", "AffiliationID": "60121247, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematical Plasma Astrophysics, Department of Mathematics, KU Leuven"}, "7201477393": {"Name": "Matthews S.A.", "AuthorID": "7201477393", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "9237188100": {"Name": "Zharkov S.", "AuthorID": "9237188100", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Hull"}, "25929909100": {"Name": "Guglielmino S.L.", "AuthorID": "25929909100", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia-Sezione Astrofisica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Catania"}}}
