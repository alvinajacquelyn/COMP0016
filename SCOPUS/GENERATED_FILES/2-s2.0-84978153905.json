Consequently, the way we represent our body has profound implications in the way we process and locate sensations and in turn perform appropriate actions. The body can be the subject, but also the object of our experience, providing information from sensations on the body surface and viscera, but also knowledge of the body as a physical object. However, the extent to which different senses contribute to constructing the rich and unified body representations we all experience remains unclear. In this review, we aim to bring together recent research showing important roles for several different sensory modalities in constructing body representations. At the same time, we hope to generate new ideas of how and at which level the senses contribute to generate the different levels of body representations and how they interact. We will present an overview of some of the most recent neuropsychological evidence about multisensory control of pain, and the way that visual, auditory, vestibular and tactile systems contribute to the creation of coherent representations of the body. We will focus particularly on some of the topics discussed in the symposium on Multimodal Contributions to Body Representation held on the 15th International Multisensory Research Forum (2015, Pisa, Italy).", "AuthorKeywords": ["audition", "body representations", "Multisensory integration", "pain", "touch", "vestibular system", "vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body representations", "Multisensory integration", "pain", "touch", "Vestibular system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978153905", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"15135145500": {"Name": "Azan\u00f5n E.", "AuthorID": "15135145500", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}, "16481455200": {"Name": "Tam\u00e8 L.", "AuthorID": "16481455200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}, "15765869300": {"Name": "Longo M.R.", "AuthorID": "15765869300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}, "6604039076": {"Name": "Maravita A.", "AuthorID": "6604039076", "AffiliationID": "114536263", "AffiliationName": "Neuromi: Milan Center for Neuroscience"}, "24765486200": {"Name": "Linkenauger S.A.", "AuthorID": "24765486200", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University"}, "35408852800": {"Name": "Ferr\u00e8 E.R.", "AuthorID": "35408852800", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}}}
