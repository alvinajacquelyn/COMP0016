This study addressed the impact of teaching format, examination consequences and student motivation on skills retention. Methods A total of 493 fourth-year medical students participated in a six-group, partially randomised trial. Students received three levels of teaching intensity: self-directed learning (2 groups), lectures (2 groups) or small-group peer-teaching (2 groups). On each level of teaching intensity, end-of-course written examinations (ECG exit exam) were summative in one group and formative in the other. Learning outcome was assessed in a retention test two months later. Results Retention test scores were predicted by summative assessments (adjusted beta 4.08; 95% CI 1.39-6.78) but not by the type of teaching. Overall performance levels and motivation did not predict performance decrease or skills retention. Conclusions Summative assessments increase medium-term retention of ECG interpretation skills, irrespective of instructional format.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Decrease", "Electrocardiogram", "Forgetting", "Learning", "Medical education", "Teaching"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiology", "Clinical Competence", "Education, Medical", "Educational Measurement", "Electrocardiography", "Germany", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Single-Blind Method", "Teaching", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947997744", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"23135592200": {"Name": "Raupach T.", "AuthorID": "23135592200", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "G\u00f6ttingen Unversity Medical Centre, Clinic for Cardiology and Pneumology"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College"}, "55930776800": {"Name": "Harendza S.", "AuthorID": "55930776800", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Centre"}, "57200811182": {"Name": "Anders S.", "AuthorID": "57200811182", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Centre"}, "35093126800": {"Name": "Schuelper N.", "AuthorID": "35093126800", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre"}}}
