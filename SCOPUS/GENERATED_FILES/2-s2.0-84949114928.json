All rights reserved.Pre-coagulation and then flocculation with/without sedimentation before ultrafiltration (CSUF/CUF) was compared to explore the process for treating synthetic humic rich water and controlling membrane fouling. The sedimentation process caused larger flocs to be removed and zeta potential of the remaining flocs to be more negative. Also the fractal dimension of flocs became smaller after sedimentation process. All the data seemed to suggest that sedimentation process can improve the membrane fouling. On the contrary, the development of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) in CSUF surprisingly increased higher than that in CUF. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of cake layer on the surface of membrane showed that the size of nano-scale primary particles formed in coagulation process was heterogeneous. It also showed that the flocs formed by larger nano-scale primary particles were removed by sedimentation process, and the smaller nano-scale primary particles in CSUF maybe the crucial reason causing higher development of TMP. The density of cake layer on the CUF membrane surface with larger nano-scale particles was much lower than that by CSUF. Therefore, the characteristic of flocs, especially the size of nano-scale primary particles, may be the main factor inducing higher increase of TMP in CSUF, which should be explored in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coagulation", "Fractal dimension", "Membrane fouling", "Primary particles", "Sedimentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coagulation process", "Humic-rich water", "Nanoscale particles", "Primary particles", "Sedimentation process", "Submerged membrane", "The scanning electron microscopes (SEM)", "Transmembrane pressures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949114928", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"8431641700": {"Name": "Yu W.", "AuthorID": "8431641700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "55427866900": {"Name": "Qu J.", "AuthorID": "55427866900", "AffiliationID": "60010689, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7402520277": {"Name": "Gregory J.", "AuthorID": "7402520277", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
