All rights reserved.Mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene are a known cause of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Clinically, patients resemble Becker's muscular dystrophy and generally present in the first two decades of life with a mild, progressive phenotype. Cardiac involvement is variable. Heterozygous carriers are usually clinically unaffected. We report a patient presenting later in life with life-threatening cardiac failure and we describe for the first time clinically manifesting carriers in the family.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac failure", "Fukutin-related protein", "Late onset", "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy", "Manifesting carriers", "Muscular dystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle", "Pedigree"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920982506", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36911788600": {"Name": "Schottlaender L.", "AuthorID": "36911788600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
