Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Rapid changes in the environment evoke a comparison between expectancy and actual outcome to inform optimal subsequent behavior. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a key interface between the hippocampus and neocortical regions, is a candidate region for mediating this comparison. Here, we report event-related potentials obtained from the NAcc using direct intracranial recordings in 5 human participants while they listened to trains of auditory stimuli differing in their degree of deviation from repetitive background stimuli. NAcc recordings revealed an early mismatch signal (50-220 ms) in response to all deviants. NAcc activity in this time window was also sensitive to the statistics of stimulus deviancy, with larger amplitudes as a function of the level of deviancy. Importantly, this NAcc mismatch signal also predicted generation of longer latency scalp potentials (300-400 ms). The results provide direct human evidence that the NAcc is a key component of a network engaged in encoding statistics of the sensory environmental.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory mismatch", "nucleus accumbens", "P3", "prediction error", "predictive coding", "saliency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Anterior Thalamic Nuclei", "Auditory Perception", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Nucleus Accumbens"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961275731", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35745859800": {"Name": "Durschmid S.", "AuthorID": "35745859800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology"}, "57206471338": {"Name": "Knight R.T.", "AuthorID": "57206471338", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of California"}, "7801660336": {"Name": "Zaehle T.", "AuthorID": "7801660336", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stereotactic Neurosurgery, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "7004941182": {"Name": "Hinrichs H.", "AuthorID": "7004941182", "AffiliationID": "114547700", "AffiliationName": "Forschungscampus STIMULATE"}, "7103232231": {"Name": "Heinze H.J.", "AuthorID": "7103232231", "AffiliationID": "114547700", "AffiliationName": "Forschungscampus STIMULATE"}, "7003574897": {"Name": "Voges J.", "AuthorID": "7003574897", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "16303496900": {"Name": "Garrido M.I.", "AuthorID": "16303496900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, University of Queensland"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL, Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}}}
