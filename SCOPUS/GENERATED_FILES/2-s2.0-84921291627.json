In male subjects, the highest incidence of positive test results was found in urethral swabs (PSA 76%, AP 71%) and the lowest frequencies appeared in perianal and rectal swabs (15-20%). Microscopic evaluation for spermatozoa was positive between 39% in urethral swabs and 1% in rectal swabs. PPV regarding positive identification of spermatozoa was 33.3% for PSA and 31.5% for AP. The combination of both tests yielded a PPV of 38.2%. In female cases, no spermatozoa were identified, and one case was PSA- and AP-positive in perianal swabs. Our findings indicate that PSA and AP tests are of limited value for the postmortem detection of spermatozoa in male subjects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acid phosphatase", "Forensic casework", "Forensic science", "Prostate-specific antigen", "Semen", "Spermatozoa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid Phosphatase", "Anal Canal", "Female", "Forensic Pathology", "Humans", "Male", "Penis", "Perineum", "Postmortem Changes", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Rectum", "ROC Curve", "Specimen Handling", "Spermatozoa", "Vagina"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921291627", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56486121900": {"Name": "Weitzig L.", "AuthorID": "56486121900", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "35485611100": {"Name": "Schroeder A.", "AuthorID": "35485611100", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "7004760778": {"Name": "Augustin C.", "AuthorID": "7004760778", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "57200811182": {"Name": "Anders S.", "AuthorID": "57200811182", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "23135592200": {"Name": "Raupach T.", "AuthorID": "23135592200", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, University Hospital Goettingen"}, "54890783500": {"Name": "Sehner S.", "AuthorID": "54890783500", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
