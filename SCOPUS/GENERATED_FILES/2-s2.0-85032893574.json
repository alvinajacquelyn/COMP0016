Recently, it has been proposed that body schema relies on adequate functioning of the motor system, which is strongly implicated in discriminating between one\u2019s own and someone else\u2019s body. The present study aimed to investigate the motor-based bodily self in eating disorders and controls, in order to examine the role of the motor system in body representation disturbances at the body schema level. Method: Female outpatients diagnosed with eating disorders (N = 15), and healthy controls (N = 18) underwent a hand laterality task, in which their own (self-stimuli) and someone else\u2019s hands (other-stimuli) were displayed at different orientations. Participants had to mentally rotate their own hand in order to provide a laterality judgement. Group differences in motor-based bodily self-recognition\u2014i.e. whether a general advantage occurred when implicitly processing self- vs. other-stimuli \u2212 were evaluated, by analyzing response times and accuracy by means of mixed ANOVAs. Results: Patients with eating disorders did not show a temporal advantage when mentally rotating self-stimuli compared to other-stimuli, as opposed to controls (F(1, 31) = 5.6, p = 0.02; eating disorders-other = 1092 \u00b1256 msec, eating disorders-self = 1097\u00b1254 msec; healthy controls-other = 1239\u00b1233 msec, healthy controls -self = 1192\u00b1232 msec). Conclusion: This study provides initial indication that high-level motor functions might be compromised as part of body schema disturbances in eating disorders. Further larger investigations are required to test motor system abnormalities in the context of body schema disturbance in eating disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Body Image", "Body Mass Index", "Case-Control Studies", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032893574", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35387736800": {"Name": "Campione G.", "AuthorID": "35387736800", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Eating and Weight Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "36847150500": {"Name": "Mansi G.", "AuthorID": "36847150500", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Child Psychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "51963733300": {"Name": "Fumagalli A.", "AuthorID": "51963733300", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Child Psychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "57196422630": {"Name": "Fumagalli B.", "AuthorID": "57196422630", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Child Psychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "57196422636": {"Name": "Sottocornola S.", "AuthorID": "57196422636", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Child Psychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "7003975446": {"Name": "Molteni M.", "AuthorID": "7003975446", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Child Psychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
