EM waves with helical wavefront carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) attract more attentions recently for its promising applications in communications. The OAM generation for microwaves was rarely reported. And existing designs are usually very complicated and suffer low efficiency problems. We propose composite PEC (perfect electric conductor)-PMC (perfect magnetic conductor) metasurfaces to convert the LCP (RCP) plane wave with zero OAM to the RCP (LCP) helical EM wave with desired OAM at microwave regime. The conversion efficiency can nearly reach 100%.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997327923", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57116687500": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57116687500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Hong Kong"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Hong Kong"}}}
