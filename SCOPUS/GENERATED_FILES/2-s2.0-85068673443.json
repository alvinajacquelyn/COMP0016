Two sentence comprehension tasks showed that two patients, P1 and P2, had impaired syntactic comprehension, whereas P3 and P4\u2019s sentence comprehension was intact. The memory assessment tasks showed that P1 and P2 had severely impaired short-term memory, whereas P3 and P4 performed within the normal range in the short-term memory tasks. This finding suggests an association between short-term memory deficit and sentence comprehension difficulties. P1 and P3 exhibited impaired comparable working memory deficits, suggesting a dissociation between working memory and sentence comprehension.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aphasia", "language", "memory", "sentence comprehension", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aphasia", "Comprehension", "Humans", "Linguistics", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Short-Term", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068673443", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"53464389100": {"Name": "Varkanitsa M.", "AuthorID": "53464389100", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "6603648912": {"Name": "Druks J.", "AuthorID": "6603648912", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Linguistics, University College London"}, "8705583500": {"Name": "Van de Koot H.", "AuthorID": "8705583500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Linguistics, University College London"}, "24402908300": {"Name": "Kasselimis D.", "AuthorID": "24402908300", "AffiliationID": "60012413, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Universitry of Crete, Voutes Campus"}, "6701351894": {"Name": "Evdokimidis I.", "AuthorID": "6701351894", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology and Language Disorders Unit, 1stDepartment of Neurology, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6602282463": {"Name": "Potagas C.", "AuthorID": "6602282463", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology and Language Disorders Unit, 1stDepartment of Neurology, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "54683498200": {"Name": "Boulouis G.", "AuthorID": "54683498200", "AffiliationID": "60020773, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Service d\u2019Imagerie Morphologique et Fonctionnelle, H\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "8923645900": {"Name": "Fugard A.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8923645900", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosocial Studies, University of London"}}}
