However, very few studies have been reported on the usage of acoustic force patterning for the rapid arrangement of biological objects, such as cells, in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. In this study, we report on a bio-acoustic force patterning technique, which uses surface acoustic waves (SAWs) for the rapid arrangement of cells within an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). A proof-of-principle was achieved through both simulations and experiments based on the in-house fabricated piezoelectric SAW transducers, which enabled us to explore the effects of various parameters on the performance of the built construct. The SAWs were applied in a fashion that generated standing SAWs (SSAWs) on the substrate, the energy of which subsequently was transferred into the gel, creating a rapid, and contactless alignment of the cells (<10 s, based on the experimental conditions). Following ultraviolet radiation induced photo-crosslinking of the cell encapsulated GelMA pre-polymer solution, the patterned cardiac cells readily spread after alignment in the GelMA hydrogel and demonstrated beating activity in 5-7 days. The described acoustic force assembly method can be utilized not only to control the spatial distribution of the cells inside a 3D construct, but can also preserve the viability and functionality of the patterned cells (e.g. beating rates of cardiac cells). This platform can be potentially employed in a diverse range of applications, whether it is for tissue engineering, in vitro cell studies, or creating 3D biomimetic tissue structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D micro-organization", "gelatingelatin", "hydrogel", "surface acoustic waves", "tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Emerging technologies", "Experimental conditions", "Extracellular matrices", "gelatingelatin", "Patterning techniques", "Proof of principles", "Surface acoustic waves", "Three-dimensional (3D) environments", "Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Gelatin", "Hydrogels", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Polymers", "Rats", "Sound", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Ultraviolet Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016563345", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57190209724": {"Name": "Naseer S.M.", "AuthorID": "57190209724", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Rankine Building"}, "24168639200": {"Name": "Manbachi A.", "AuthorID": "24168639200", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University"}, "57193622234": {"Name": "Samandari M.", "AuthorID": "57193622234", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran"}, "57196008590": {"Name": "Walch P.", "AuthorID": "57196008590", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University"}, "57221269902": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "57221269902", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60097350", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "56191420300": {"Name": "Zhang Y.S.", "AuthorID": "56191420300", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60097350", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57191625359": {"Name": "Davoudi F.", "AuthorID": "57191625359", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60097350", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57193790464": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57193790464", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60097350", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "6602921939": {"Name": "Khademhosseini A.", "AuthorID": "6602921939", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King Abdulaziz University"}, "7403646810": {"Name": "Shin S.R.", "AuthorID": "7403646810", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60097350", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Rankine Building"}, "16303091100": {"Name": "Abrinia K.", "AuthorID": "16303091100", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran"}}}
