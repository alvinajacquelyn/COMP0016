Materials and methods: Data on 159 women with MFP interposition as part of their primary procedure between 2 September 2005 and 2 July 2015 were prospectively collected. Patient demographics and the indications for MFP interposition along with the outcomes of their primary procedures and short- and long-term complications related to the MFP, along with patient reported perception of post-operative appearance, were noted. Results: The main indications for MFP interposition were urethral diverticulum excision (74), vaginal repair of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) (43), removal and repair of urethral erosion of mid-urethral tape (MUT) (24), female urethroplasty for stricture (12), vaginal closure of bladder neck for complex end-stage stress urinary incontinence (USUI) (4) and as a MUT wrap for protection of urethra and vagina in women with fragile urethras (2). The majority of patients (127 or 79 %) rated the post-operative appearance of their labia as good or excellent. Only 1 patient (0.6 %) felt the post-operative appearance was unsatisfactory. There were 2 post-harvest labial haematoma (1.25 %), 1 labial wound infection in an overweight diabetic patient (0.6 %) and no other significant short- or long-term complications. Conclusions: MFP interposition is associated with good cosmesis and a very low complication rate (<2 %). It appears to lower new onset post-procedure USUI, prevent erosion in the \u2018fragile\u2019 urethra and improve outcomes following repair of post-surgery VVF/UVF. MFP is a versatile and effective tool in the female urologists\u2019 armamentarium.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diverticulum", "Fistula", "Incontinence", "Martius fat pad"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Aged", "Diverticulum", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gynecologic Surgical Procedures", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Retrospective Studies", "Surgical Flaps", "Urethral Diseases", "Urinary Incontinence, Stress", "Urologic Surgical Procedures", "Vesicovaginal Fistula", "Vulva", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978036051", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"43261497500": {"Name": "Malde S.", "AuthorID": "43261497500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "35225313500": {"Name": "Spilotros M.", "AuthorID": "35225313500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "57190178268": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "57190178268", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "55851940397": {"Name": "Hamid R.", "AuthorID": "55851940397", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "6506281538": {"Name": "Ockrim J.", "AuthorID": "6506281538", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "7403285262": {"Name": "Shah P.J.", "AuthorID": "7403285262", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}}}
