The aim of this study was to explore frailty index across LT, as a measure of morbidity and mortality. This was a retrospective observational study including all consecutive 47 HIV+patients who received LT in Modena, Italy from 2003 to June 2015. Methods: frailty index (FI) was constructed from 30 health variables. It was used both as a continuous score and as a categorical variable, defining 'most frail' a FI > 0.45. FI change across transplant (deltaFI, \u0394FI) was calculated as the difference between year 1 FI (FI-Y1) and pre-transplant FI (FI-t0). The outcomes measures were mortality and \"otpimal LT\" (defined as being alive without multi-morbidity). Results: Median value of FI-t0 was 0.48 (IQR 0.42-0.52), FI-Y1 was 0.31 (IQR 0.26-0.41). At year five mortality rate was 45%, \"optimal transplant\" rate at year 1 was 38%. All the patients who died in the post-LT were most frail in the pre-LT. \u0394FI was a predictor of mortality after correction for age and MELD (HR = 1.10, p = 0.006) and was inversely associated with optimal transplant after correction for age (HR = 1.04, p = 0.01). Conclusions: We validated FI as a valuable health measure in HIV transplant. In particular, we found a relevant correlation between FI strata at baseline and mortality and a statistically significant correlation between, \u0394FI and survival rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Frailty", "HIV", "Transplant"], "IndexKeywords": ["End Stage Liver Disease", "Female", "Frailty", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Italy", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026835013", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"35419288400": {"Name": "Guaraldi G.", "AuthorID": "35419288400", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults and Children"}, "55966429800": {"Name": "Dolci G.", "AuthorID": "55966429800", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults and Children"}, "24449825600": {"Name": "Zona S.", "AuthorID": "24449825600", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults and Children"}, "55329570000": {"Name": "Franceschini E.", "AuthorID": "55329570000", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults and Children"}, "6602391491": {"Name": "Codeluppi M.", "AuthorID": "6602391491", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults and Children"}, "7006842875": {"Name": "Mussini C.", "AuthorID": "7006842875", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults and Children"}, "57201976814": {"Name": "Tarantino G.", "AuthorID": "57201976814", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Dept. of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults Children, Liver Multivisceral Transplant Center"}, "10839166900": {"Name": "Serra V.", "AuthorID": "10839166900", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Dept. of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults Children, Liver Multivisceral Transplant Center"}, "24066285400": {"Name": "Ballarin R.", "AuthorID": "24066285400", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Dept. of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults Children, Liver Multivisceral Transplant Center"}, "57188534945": {"Name": "Benedetto F.", "AuthorID": "57188534945", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Dept. of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Adults Children, Liver Multivisceral Transplant Center"}, "55829793800": {"Name": "Brothers T.", "AuthorID": "55829793800", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "Dalhousie University, Faculty of Medicine"}}}
