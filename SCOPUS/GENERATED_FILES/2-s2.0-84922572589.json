T-tests showed that there were significant changes of malaise mean scores over the 27. years: malaise scores decreased significantly from 23 to 33. years, but increased significantly from 33 to 42. years, and there were no significant change between 42 and 50. years. The trend showed a similar pattern for men and women, though women scored significantly higher than men on the measure at every time point. Correlational analysis showed that over 27. years malaise scores ranged from r= .41 to r= .52, indicating the relative stability. Malaise was significantly and inversely associated with childhood intelligence and behavioural problems. It was also significantly associated with education in the expected direction. Regression analysis showed that previous malaise scores were significant predictors of the later ones, and the strength of the predictive power decreased over time.
