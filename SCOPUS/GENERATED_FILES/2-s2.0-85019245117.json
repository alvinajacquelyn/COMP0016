This study assessed which parties are involved in the development of such guidelines worldwide, which national guidelines address primary care, what recommendations are made for primary care settings, and how these recommendations correlate with each other and with current evidence. We identified national guidelines using an online resource. Only the most recent version of a guideline was included. If an English version was not available, we requested a translation or summary of the recommendations from the authors. Two researchers independently extracted data on funding sources, development methodologies, involved parties, and recommendations made within the guidelines. These recommendations were categorised using the pile-sort method. Each recommendation was cross-checked with the latest evidence and was awarded an evidence-rating. We identified 43 guidelines from 39 countries and after exclusion, we analysed 26 guidelines (22 targeting general population, 4 targeted subpopulations). Twelve categories of recommendations for primary care were identified. There was almost universal agreement regarding the need to identify smokers, advice them to quit and offer behavioural and pharmacological quit smoking support. Discrepancies were greatest for specific recommendations regarding behavioural and pharmacological support, which are likely to be due to different interpretations of evidence and/or differences in contextual health environments. Based on these findings, we developed a universal checklist of guideline recommendations as a practice tool for primary care professionals and future guideline developers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Global Health", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Primary Health Care", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019245117", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55326526600": {"Name": "Verbiest M.", "AuthorID": "55326526600", "AffiliationID": "60078831, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Research - He Ara ki Mua, School of Population Health, University of Auckland"}, "57216280128": {"Name": "Brakema E.", "AuthorID": "57216280128", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "56638401700": {"Name": "Van Der Kleij R.", "AuthorID": "56638401700", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "6604023299": {"Name": "Chavannes N.", "AuthorID": "6604023299", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "56479173000": {"Name": "Sheals K.", "AuthorID": "56479173000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57216283722": {"Name": "McEwen A.", "AuthorID": "57216283722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57204026385": {"Name": "Allistone G.", "AuthorID": "57204026385", "AffiliationID": "112946246", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training"}, "20136431400": {"Name": "Williams S.", "AuthorID": "20136431400", "AffiliationID": "112107099", "AffiliationName": "International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG)"}}}
