Med.", "Volume": "21", "Issue": 9, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1987, "PageEnd": 1997, "CitedBy": 14, "DOI": "10.1038/s41436-019-0451-z", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061182628&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).Purpose: Outcomes in patients with Fabry disease receiving migalastat during the phase 3 FACETS trial (NCT00925301) were evaluated by phenotype. Methods: Data were evaluated in two subgroups of patients with migalastat-amenable GLA variants: \u201cclassic phenotype\u201d (n = 14; males with residual peripheral blood mononuclear cell \u03b1-galactosidase A <3% normal and multiorgan system involvement) and \u201cother patients\u201d (n = 36; males not meeting classic phenotype criteria and all females). Endpoints included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), left ventricular mass index (LVMi), Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale diarrhea subscale (GSRS-D), renal peritubular capillary (PTC) globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) inclusions, and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). Results: Baseline measures in the classic phenotype patients suggested a more severe phenotype. At month 24, mean (SD) annualized change in eGFRCKD-EPI with migalastat was \u22120.3 (3.76) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the classic phenotype subgroup; changes in LVMi, GSRS-D, and lyso-Gb3 were \u221216.7 (18.64) g/m2, \u22120.9 (1.66), and \u221236.8 (35.78) nmol/L, respectively. At month 6, mean PTC GL-3 inclusions decreased with migalastat (\u22120.8) and increased with placebo (0.3); switching from placebo to migalastat, PTC inclusions decreased by \u22120.7. Numerically smaller changes in these endpoints were observed in the other patients. Conclusion: Migalastat provided clinical benefit to patients with Fabry disease and amenable variants, regardless of disease severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classic", "Fabry disease", "migalastat", "pharmacogenetics", "precision medicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["1-Deoxynojirimycin", "Adolescent", "Adult", "alpha-Galactosidase", "Double-Blind Method", "Fabry Disease", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Kidney", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Pharmacogenetics", "Precision Medicine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061182628", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7006706457": {"Name": "Germain D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006706457", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106116, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Genetics and Inserm U1179, University of Versailles, Paris-Saclay University"}, "7006627484": {"Name": "Nicholls K.", "AuthorID": "7006627484", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "7005600401": {"Name": "Giugliani R.", "AuthorID": "7005600401", "AffiliationID": "60014120, 60006726", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genetics Service, HCPA, and Department of Genetics, UFRGS"}, "7005292729": {"Name": "Bichet D.G.", "AuthorID": "7005292729", "AffiliationID": "60031078, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, University of Montreal"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.A.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "22233538700": {"Name": "Barisoni L.M.", "AuthorID": "22233538700", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60029251", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine"}, "55536642300": {"Name": "Colvin R.B.", "AuthorID": "55536642300", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "57207608263": {"Name": "Jennette J.C.", "AuthorID": "57207608263", "AffiliationID": "60020469, 60025111", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "57196346215": {"Name": "Skuban N.", "AuthorID": "57196346215", "AffiliationID": "112567048", "AffiliationName": "Amicus Therapeutics, Inc"}, "55304953200": {"Name": "Castelli J.P.", "AuthorID": "55304953200", "AffiliationID": "112567048", "AffiliationName": "Amicus Therapeutics, Inc"}, "8325555900": {"Name": "Benjamin E.", "AuthorID": "8325555900", "AffiliationID": "112567048", "AffiliationName": "Amicus Therapeutics, Inc"}, "57210542041": {"Name": "Barth J.A.", "AuthorID": "57210542041", "AffiliationID": "112567048", "AffiliationName": "Amicus Therapeutics, Inc"}, "57190621097": {"Name": "Viereck C.", "AuthorID": "57190621097", "AffiliationID": "112567048", "AffiliationName": "Amicus Therapeutics, Inc"}}}
