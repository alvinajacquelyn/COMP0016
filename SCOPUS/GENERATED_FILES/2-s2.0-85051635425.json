The first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a cellular cancer therapy in 2017, Novartis's CD19-targeting CAR T-cell product Kymriah\u2122 within the context of relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL, followed rapidly by approval of Kite's Yescarta\u2122 and, more recently, Kymriah\u2122 for diffuse large B-cell indications in adults, highlights the pace of progress made in this field. In this review, we will consider the latest evidence from CAR T-cell therapy for B-lineage ALL. We discuss the barriers to CAR T-cell therapy for ALL patients and give a perspective on the strategy we have taken to date to widen access to CAR T-cell therapy for UK pediatric patients with high-risk ALL.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antigens, CD19", "B-Lymphocytes", "Child", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Drug Approval", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Lentivirus", "Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Protein Domains", "Protein Engineering", "Receptors, Chimeric Antigen", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051635425", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"23987460500": {"Name": "Ghorashian S.", "AuthorID": "23987460500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
