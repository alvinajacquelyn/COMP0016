Analysis of raw bioelectric impedance vectors (BIVA), resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and phase angle (PA) may be an alternative for monitoring disease progression/treatment. Clinical experience of BIVA in children is limited. We investigated predictors of BIVA and their ability to predict clinical outcomes in children with complex diagnoses. Methods: R, Xc and PA were measured (BODYSTAT Quadscan 4000) on admission in 108 patients (4.6\u201316.8 years, mean 10.0). R and Xc were indexed by height (H) and BIVA-SDS for age and sex calculated using data from healthy children. Potential predictors and clinical outcomes (greater-than-expected length-of-stay (LOS), complications) were recorded. Results: Mean R/H-SDS was significantly higher (0.99 (SD 1.32)) and PA-SDS lower (\u22121.22 (1.68))) than expected, with a wide range for all parameters. In multivariate models, the Strongkids risk category predicted R/H-SDS (adjusted mean for low, medium and high risk = 0.49, 1.28, 2.17, p = 0.009) and PA-SDS (adjusted mean \u22120.52, \u22121.53, \u22122.36, p = 0.01). BIVA-SDS were not significantly different in patients with or without adverse outcomes. Conclusions: These complex patients had abnormal mean BIVA-SDS suggestive of reduced hydration and poor cellular health according to conventional interpretation. R/H-SDS was higher and PA-SDS lower in those classified as higher malnutrition risk by the StrongKids tool. Further investigation in specific patient groups, including those with acute fluid shifts and using disease-specific outcomes, may better define the clinical role of BIV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adolescent", "Body Composition", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Child", "Child, Hospitalized", "Child, Preschool", "Electric Impedance", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Nutrition Therapy", "Organism Hydration Status", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065771570", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57208775771": {"Name": "Roche S.", "AuthorID": "57208775771", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57203621918": {"Name": "Lara-Pompa N.E.", "AuthorID": "57203621918", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7201914391": {"Name": "Macdonald S.", "AuthorID": "7201914391", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57208783548": {"Name": "Fawbert K.", "AuthorID": "57208783548", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57208783869": {"Name": "Valente J.", "AuthorID": "57208783869", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "8652540000": {"Name": "Williams J.E.", "AuthorID": "8652540000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7402766240": {"Name": "Hill S.", "AuthorID": "7402766240", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.S.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}}}
