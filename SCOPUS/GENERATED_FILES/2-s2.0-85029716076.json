However, ageing does not affect people uniformly. Hence, markers of the underlying biological ageing process are needed to help identify people at increased risk of age-associated physical and cognitive impairments and ultimately, death. Here, we present such a biomarker, 'brain-predicted age', derived using structural neuroimaging. Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N=2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N=669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and DNA-methylation-predicted age did. This indicates that neuroimaging and epigenetics measures of ageing can provide complementary data regarding health outcomes. Our study introduces a clinically-relevant neuroimaging ageing biomarker and demonstrates that combining distinct measurements of biological ageing further helps to determine risk of age-related deterioration and death.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognition", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Machine Learning", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029716076", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7403376270": {"Name": "Cole J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403376270", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Medicine, Imperial College London, Burlington Danes Building"}, "35559514400": {"Name": "Sharp D.J.", "AuthorID": "35559514400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Medicine, Imperial College London, Burlington Danes Building"}, "57205535517": {"Name": "Ritchie S.J.", "AuthorID": "57205535517", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006141241": {"Name": "Bastin M.E.", "AuthorID": "7006141241", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57189602736": {"Name": "Vald\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez M.C.", "AuthorID": "57189602736", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "23036018100": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz Maniega S.", "AuthorID": "23036018100", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "53985201300": {"Name": "Royle N.", "AuthorID": "53985201300", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "23485020100": {"Name": "Corley J.", "AuthorID": "23485020100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603830153": {"Name": "Pattie A.", "AuthorID": "6603830153", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7403484635": {"Name": "Harris S.E.", "AuthorID": "7403484635", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "24470564300": {"Name": "Marioni R.E.", "AuthorID": "24470564300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}, "7101906583": {"Name": "Starr J.M.", "AuthorID": "7101906583", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "55614945700": {"Name": "Cox S.R.", "AuthorID": "55614945700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "35417533500": {"Name": "Wardlaw J.M.", "AuthorID": "35417533500", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57193752767": {"Name": "Deary I.J.", "AuthorID": "57193752767", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "53064617200": {"Name": "Redmond P.", "AuthorID": "53064617200", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "57195270073": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "57195270073", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland"}, "7006428088": {"Name": "Wray N.R.", "AuthorID": "7006428088", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}}}
