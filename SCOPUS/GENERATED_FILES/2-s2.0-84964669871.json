Methods An original survey was administered to delegates attending two large colorectal surgical meetings in 2015. The 21 questions covered long term follow-up, specific issues for teenagers and transition of care. Results 96/236 delegates completed the survey. Follow-up was routinely suspended before 10 year of age by 33% of respondents. 90% of them did not use a scoring system to assess or risks stratify patients, despite 81% stating that an objective score would be beneficial. 40% of respondents felt that > 30% of their teenagers had ongoing active medical or psychosocial issues. 42% thought their patients were not ready to be transitioned. The process of transition should start around 13\u201316 years according to 54% of respondents. 72% had no protocol for transition and 82% did not hold multidisciplinary meetings with adult practitioners before transition. Conclusions International consensus on the following aspects of the care in ARM is needed: structured long term follow-up, objective assessment and risk stratification scores, pathways of transition and methods to prepare patients, parents and adult practitioners.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorectal malformation", "Children", "Follow-up", "Long term outcomes", "Teenagers", "Transition of care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Aftercare", "Anorectal Malformations", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Consensus", "Global Health", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Transition to Adult Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964669871", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7102544316": {"Name": "Giuliani S.", "AuthorID": "7102544316", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56973639600": {"Name": "Decker E.", "AuthorID": "56973639600", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8353139200": {"Name": "Leva E.", "AuthorID": "8353139200", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "6602524723": {"Name": "Riccipetitoni G.", "AuthorID": "6602524723", "AffiliationID": "60083540", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Buzzi Children's Hospital"}, "7003559399": {"Name": "Bagolan P.", "AuthorID": "7003559399", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesu\u2019 Research Children's Hospital"}}}
