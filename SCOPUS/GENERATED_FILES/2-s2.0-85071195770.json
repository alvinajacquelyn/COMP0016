Here, we uncover the molecular bases of hsEH inhibition mediated by the endogenous 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). Our data reveal a dual inhibitory mechanism, whereby hsEH can be inhibited by reversible docking of 15d-PGJ2 in the catalytic pocket, as well as by covalent locking of the same compound onto cysteine residues C423 and C522, remote to the active site. Biophysical characterisations allied with in silico investigations indicate that the covalent modification of the reactive cysteines may be part of a hitherto undiscovered allosteric regulatory mechanism of the enzyme. This study provides insights into the molecular modes of inhibition of hsEH epoxy-hydrolytic activity and paves the way for the development of new allosteric inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Catalytic Domain", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Cysteine", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Enzyme Stability", "Epoxide Hydrolases", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Models, Molecular", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Prostaglandin D2", "Protein Domains", "Sequence Alignment", "Solubility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071195770", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57203896136": {"Name": "Abis G.", "AuthorID": "57203896136", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7402373186": {"Name": "Atkinson R.A.", "AuthorID": "7402373186", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Spectroscopy, King\u2019s College London"}, "7101937643": {"Name": "Bui T.T.T.", "AuthorID": "7101937643", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Spectroscopy, King\u2019s College London"}, "57210640748": {"Name": "Popova S.", "AuthorID": "57210640748", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7406430031": {"Name": "Sun Y.B.", "AuthorID": "7406430031", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7003627406": {"Name": "Fraternali F.", "AuthorID": "7003627406", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "35579153900": {"Name": "Conte M.R.", "AuthorID": "35579153900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Spectroscopy, King\u2019s College London"}, "21740482800": {"Name": "Charles R.L.", "AuthorID": "21740482800", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Cardiovascular Medicine & Science, The Rayne Institute, Lambeth Wing, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "7005831172": {"Name": "Eaton P.", "AuthorID": "7005831172", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Cardiovascular Medicine & Science, The Rayne Institute, Lambeth Wing, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "56652459500": {"Name": "Kopec J.", "AuthorID": "56652459500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Structural Genomics Consortium, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7102549319": {"Name": "Yue W.W.", "AuthorID": "7102549319", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Structural Genomics Consortium, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "24724971300": {"Name": "Lynham S.", "AuthorID": "24724971300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics Facility, Centre of Excellence for Mass Spectrometry, The James Black Centre, King\u2019s College London"}}}
