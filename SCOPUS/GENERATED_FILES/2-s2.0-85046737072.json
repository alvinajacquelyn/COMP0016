American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Owing to the heritage of previous missions such as the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Venus Express, the typical global plasma environment of Venus is relatively well understood. On the other hand, this is not true for more extreme driving conditions such as during passages of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). One of the outstanding questions is how do ICMEs, either the ejecta or sheath portions, impact (1) the Venusian magnetic topology and (2) escape rates of planetary ions? One of the main issues encountered when addressing these problems is the difficulty of inferring global dynamics from single spacecraft obits; this is where the benefits of simulations become apparent. In the present study, we present a detailed case study of an ICME interaction with Venus on 5 November 2011 in which the magnetic barrier reached over 250 nT. We use both Venus Express observations and hybrid simulation runs to study the impact on the field draping pattern and the escape rates of planetary O+ ions. The simulation showed that the magnetic field line draping pattern around Venus during the ICME is similar to that during typical solar wind conditions and that O+ ion escape rates are increased by approximately 30% due to the ICME. Moreover, the atypically large magnetic barrier appears to manifest from a number of factors such as the flux pileup, dayside compression, and the driving time from the ICME ejecta.", "AuthorKeywords": ["interplanetary coronal mass ejection", "model-data comparison", "oxygen escape", "planetary magnetospheres", "Venus", "Venus Express"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046737072", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"36930054400": {"Name": "Dimmock A.P.", "AuthorID": "36930054400", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "55505711400": {"Name": "Alho M.", "AuthorID": "55505711400", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University"}, "8454153300": {"Name": "Kallio E.", "AuthorID": "8454153300", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University"}, "7004422663": {"Name": "Pulkkinen T.I.", "AuthorID": "7004422663", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University"}, "23028968200": {"Name": "Pope S.A.", "AuthorID": "23028968200", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "7404374658": {"Name": "Zhang T.L.", "AuthorID": "7404374658", "AffiliationID": "60020103, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "25925113400": {"Name": "Kilpua E.", "AuthorID": "25925113400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Helsinki"}, "13606959300": {"Name": "Futaana Y.", "AuthorID": "13606959300", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
