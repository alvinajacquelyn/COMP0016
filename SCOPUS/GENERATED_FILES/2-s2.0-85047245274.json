Near-field scanning probe microscopy is commonly employed to enable mapping of the THz electromagnetic fields with sub-wavelength spatial resolution, allowing intriguing scientific phenomena to be explored, such as charge carrier dynamics in nanostructures and THz plasmon-polaritons in novel 2D materials and devices. High-resolution THz imaging, so far, has relied predominantly on THz detection techniques that require either an ultrafast laser or a cryogenically cooled THz detector. Here, we demonstrate coherent near-field imaging in the THz frequency range using a room-temperature nanodetector embedded in the aperture of a near-field probe, and an interferometric optical setup driven by a THz quantum cascade laser. By performing phase-sensitive imaging of strongly confined THz fields created by plasmonic focusing, we demonstrate the potential of our novel architecture for high-sensitivity coherent THz imaging with sub-wavelength spatial resolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge carrier dynamics", "Imaging applications", "Near-field scanning", "Phase sensitive imaging", "Plasmon-polaritons", "Terahertz frequencies", "THz electromagnetic field", "THz quantum cascade lasers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047245274", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55968022400": {"Name": "Giordano M.", "AuthorID": "55968022400", "AffiliationID": "60030674, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "NEST, CNR\u2014Istituto Nanoscienze and Scuola Normale Superiore"}, "54893908100": {"Name": "Viti L.", "AuthorID": "54893908100", "AffiliationID": "60030674, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "NEST, CNR\u2014Istituto Nanoscienze and Scuola Normale Superiore"}, "8387869900": {"Name": "Vitiello M.", "AuthorID": "8387869900", "AffiliationID": "60030674, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "NEST, CNR\u2014Istituto Nanoscienze and Scuola Normale Superiore"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
