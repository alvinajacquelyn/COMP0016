To reduce the impact that higher-order processes have on imitation we used a non-human agent model to control social attention, and removed end-state target goals in half of the trials to minimise goal-directed attention. Findings showed that only neurotypical adults imitated atypical biological kinematics. Adults with autism did, however, become significantly more accurate at imitating movement time. This confirmed they engaged in the task, and that sensorimotor adaptation was self-regulated. The attentional bias to movement time suggests the attenuation in imitating kinematics might be a compensatory strategy due to deficits in lower-level visuomotor processes associated with self-other mapping, or selective attention modulated the processes that represent biological kinematics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Autism spectrum disorders", "Biological motion kinematics", "Imitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Autistic Disorder", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955659796", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"8629701800": {"Name": "Hayes S.J.", "AuthorID": "8629701800", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "54796378200": {"Name": "Andrew M.", "AuthorID": "54796378200", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "55755568100": {"Name": "Elliott D.", "AuthorID": "55755568100", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University"}, "7403105607": {"Name": "Bennett S.J.", "AuthorID": "7403105607", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "14010331700": {"Name": "Gowen E.", "AuthorID": "14010331700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "The University of Manchester"}}}
