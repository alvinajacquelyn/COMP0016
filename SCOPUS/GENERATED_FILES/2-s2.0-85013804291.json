Here we demonstrate the true dissolution of a wide range of important 2D nanomaterials by forming layered material salts that spontaneously dissolve in polar solvents yielding ionic solutions. The benign dissolution advantageously maintains the morphology of the starting material, is stable against reaggregation and can achieve solutions containing exclusively individualized monolayers. Importantly, the charge on the anionic nanosheet solutes is reversible, enables targeted deposition over large areas via electroplating and can initiate novel self-assembly upon drying. Our findings thus reveal a unique solution-like behaviour for 2D materials that enables their scalable production and controlled manipulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013804291", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57212442242": {"Name": "Cullen P.", "AuthorID": "57212442242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57193426943": {"Name": "Cox K.", "AuthorID": "57193426943", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57193417685": {"Name": "Bin Subhan M.", "AuthorID": "57193417685", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55225922100": {"Name": "Buckley D.", "AuthorID": "55225922100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003890182": {"Name": "Skipper N.", "AuthorID": "7003890182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7202774632": {"Name": "Howard C.", "AuthorID": "7202774632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15840592500": {"Name": "Picco L.", "AuthorID": "15840592500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Interface Analysis Centre, H.
