Silicon photonics also offer new opportunities for the realization of ultracompact and fully integrated sensing systems operating in the mid-infrared (MIR) regime of the spectrum. In this article, we review recent developments, through several approaches, in the direct metamorphic epitaxial growth of various III-V materials-based lasers on silicon substrates. We show that GaAs-based 1.3-\u03bcm III-V quantum dot lasers and GaSb-based MIR quantum-well lasers grown on silicon substrates can operate with low threshold current density and high operating temperature, which hold promise for the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epitaxy", "III-V", "laser", "molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)", "Si"], "IndexKeywords": ["Enabling technologies", "Fully integrated", "High operating temperature", "III-V optoelectronics", "Low threshold current density", "Midinfrared", "Silicon photonics", "Silicon substrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960946664", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7006952900": {"Name": "Tourni\u00e9 E.", "AuthorID": "7006952900", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60029631", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Institut Universitaire de France"}, "8957598800": {"Name": "Cerutti L.", "AuthorID": "8957598800", "AffiliationID": "60108488", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier"}, "55229835700": {"Name": "Rodriguez J.", "AuthorID": "55229835700", "AffiliationID": "60108488", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
