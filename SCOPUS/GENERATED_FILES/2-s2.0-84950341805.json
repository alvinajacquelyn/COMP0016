This lacks sufficiently grounded query about the meaning of \"quality of care\" for health users, and how context influences their ideas and experiences. We studied this between 2010 and 2011, repeatedly interviewing and shadowing 45 individuals in three of New York's hospital-based outpatient HIV care settings during routine visits. We found participants using common terminology, but across the cohort meaning varied and employed personal narratives. Participants conveyed the impact of historic and current experiences of stigma and discrimination on limiting access to care, and showed its destabilizing effects on quality constructs. Participants also felt they contributed to their health care settings' delivery of quality care. From our findings, we discuss the applicability and implications of \"co-production\" to conceptualize health care as jointly delivered by typical \"givers\" and \"receivers\" of care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["co-production", "context", "HIV/AIDS", "narratives", "quality improvement", "quality of care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York", "Outpatient Clinics, Hospital", "Patient Satisfaction", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Quality of Health Care", "Safety", "Social Stigma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950341805", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56601350100": {"Name": "Baim-Lance A.", "AuthorID": "56601350100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57008914900": {"Name": "Tietz D.", "AuthorID": "57008914900", "AffiliationID": "60028134", "AffiliationName": "New York State Department of Health"}, "57009086700": {"Name": "Schlefer M.", "AuthorID": "57009086700", "AffiliationID": "60028134", "AffiliationName": "New York State Department of Health"}, "57213330836": {"Name": "Agins B.", "AuthorID": "57213330836", "AffiliationID": "60028134", "AffiliationName": "New York State Department of Health"}}}
