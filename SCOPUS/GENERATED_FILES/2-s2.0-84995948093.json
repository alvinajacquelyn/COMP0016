The sensor\u2019s main advantages are: (1) Low power consumption, (2) low-level noise in comparison with conventional methods of force sensing (e.g., using strain gauges), (3) the ability to be embedded into different mechanical structures, (4) miniaturisation, (5) simple manufacture and customisation to fit a wide-range of robot systems, and (6) low-cost fabrication and assembly of sensor structure. For these reasons, the proposed multi-axis force/torque sensor can be used in a wide range of application areas including medical robotics, manufacturing, and areas involving human-robot interaction. This paper shows the application of our concept of a force/torque sensor to flexible continuum manipulators: A cylindrical MIS (Minimally Invasive Surgery) robot, and includes its design, fabrication, and evaluation tests.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Force/torque sensor", "Light intensity optics", "Multi-axis force/torque", "Optoelectronic sensors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Force/torque sensor", "Light intensity", "Minimally invasive surgery", "Multi-Axis", "Multi-axis force/torque sensors", "Opto-electronic sensors", "Optoelectronic technology", "Simply supported beams"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995948093", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56637802700": {"Name": "Noh Y.", "AuthorID": "56637802700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London"}, "15042114800": {"Name": "Housden J.", "AuthorID": "15042114800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "9245867600": {"Name": "Rhode K.", "AuthorID": "9245867600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "55512143700": {"Name": "Bimbo J.", "AuthorID": "55512143700", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "55533013500": {"Name": "Sareh S.", "AuthorID": "55533013500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London"}, "35119695800": {"Name": "Wurdemann H.", "AuthorID": "35119695800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56426562600": {"Name": "Fra\u015b J.", "AuthorID": "56426562600", "AffiliationID": "60088121", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements"}, "55849308300": {"Name": "Chathuranga D.", "AuthorID": "55849308300", "AffiliationID": "60071105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "ARQ\u2014Advanced Robotics @ Queen Mary Faculty of Science and Engineering, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
