All rights reserved.Functional mitochondria are vital to accomplish their key role in the cell, by maintaining the energy metabolism, buffering of the Ca2+ signal and directing the cell death mechanism. Mitochondrial Ca2+ can stimulate ATP production or trigger the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and activating the cell death cascade. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake play a crucial role in neurons by buffering excessive Ca2+ from the cytosol at the time of the transmission of the signal. Changes in the maintenance of mitochondrial Ca2+ may trigger neuronal cell death. Abnormality in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling has been detected in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, and emerging evidence from disease models suggests that mitochondrial Ca2+ may play a role in disease pathogenesis. In this review, we assess how mitochondrial Ca2+ imbalance may be a trigger in common neurodegenerative disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Astrocyte", "Calcium", "Mitochondria", "Neurodegeneration", "Neurons", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Cell Death", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940720205", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"24544568500": {"Name": "Abeti R.", "AuthorID": "24544568500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
