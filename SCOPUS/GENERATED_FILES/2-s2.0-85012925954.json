We describe a low-cost multispectral microscope and oximetry technique for calibration-free absolute oximetry of surgically exposed blood vessels in vivo. We imaged the vasculature of the dorsal spinal cord in healthy rats, and varied inspired oxygen (FiO2) in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the imaging system to changes in SO2. The venous SO2 was calculated as 67.8 10.4% (average standard deviation), increasing to 83.1 11.6% under hyperoxic conditions (100% FiO2) and returning to 67.4 10.9% for a second normoxic period; the venous SO2 was 50.9 15.5% and 29.2 24.6% during subsequent hypoxic states (18% and 15% FiO2 respectively). We discuss the design and performance of our multispectral imaging system, and the future scope for extending this oximetry technique to quantification of hypoxia in inflamed tissue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multispectral imaging", "oximetry", "spinal cord vasculature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Female", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Inhalation", "Microscopy", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Rats", "Spinal Cord", "Veins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012925954", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57193318227": {"Name": "Van Der Putten M.A.", "AuthorID": "57193318227", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}, "57190002937": {"Name": "Mackenzie L.E.", "AuthorID": "57190002937", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "57193308400": {"Name": "Fernandez-Ramos J.", "AuthorID": "57193308400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}, "56966146500": {"Name": "Harvey A.R.", "AuthorID": "56966146500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}, "7403657958": {"Name": "Davies A.L.", "AuthorID": "7403657958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "55888340700": {"Name": "Desai R.A.", "AuthorID": "55888340700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "55257719500": {"Name": "Smith K.J.", "AuthorID": "55257719500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London Institute of Neurology"}}}
