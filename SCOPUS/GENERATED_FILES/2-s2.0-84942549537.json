The current study determined the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD), and examined the patterns of mental health service utilization and associated factors. Methods: We analyzed data from the Hong Kong Mental Morbidity Survey (HKMMS) of 5,719 Chinese adults aged 16\u201375 years in the general Hong Kong population, using the Chinese Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). Results: The weighted prevalence estimate for any past-week CMD was 13.3 %, with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder being the most frequent diagnoses. CMD was positively associated with female gender, being divorced or separated, alcohol misuse, substance dependence, lack of regular physical exercise, and a family history of mental disorder. Among individuals with CMD, only 26 % had consulted mental health services in the past year; less than 10 % consulted general practitioners or family physicians. Lack of mental health service usage was significantly more likely in men and those with lower educational attainment. Conclusions: Apart from attention to psychosocial risks, health and lifestyle factors are important considerations for mental health promotion. Service utilization for individuals with CMD in Hong Kong remains suboptimal, and would be enhanced by strengthening community primary care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "Health service utilization", "Mental disorders", "Mental health", "Prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety Disorders", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Hong Kong", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942549537", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7201984627": {"Name": "Lam L.C.W.", "AuthorID": "7201984627", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "56145734800": {"Name": "Wang M.J.", "AuthorID": "56145734800", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "24447976700": {"Name": "Chiu H.F.K.", "AuthorID": "24447976700", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "36862843700": {"Name": "Wong C.S.M.", "AuthorID": "36862843700", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "16400525900": {"Name": "Chan W.C.", "AuthorID": "16400525900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57200371582": {"Name": "Chen E.Y.H.", "AuthorID": "57200371582", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "34573429300": {"Name": "Sham P.C.", "AuthorID": "34573429300", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "26643706700": {"Name": "Chang W.C.", "AuthorID": "26643706700", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57200364686": {"Name": "Lee E.H.M.", "AuthorID": "57200364686", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7102153803": {"Name": "Ng R.M.K.", "AuthorID": "7102153803", "AffiliationID": "60023543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Kowloon Hospital"}, "7201936267": {"Name": "Hung S.F.", "AuthorID": "7201936267", "AffiliationID": "60032219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Kwai Chung Hospital"}, "57214583163": {"Name": "Cheung E.F.C.", "AuthorID": "57214583163", "AffiliationID": "60024330", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital"}, "35299869000": {"Name": "Lam M.", "AuthorID": "35299869000", "AffiliationID": "60024330", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital"}, "55177901800": {"Name": "Chiang T.P.", "AuthorID": "55177901800", "AffiliationID": "60024330", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital"}, "26643560600": {"Name": "Lau J.T.F.", "AuthorID": "26643560600", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "7102358027": {"Name": "van Os J.", "AuthorID": "7102358027", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57204025589": {"Name": "Bebbington P.", "AuthorID": "57204025589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
