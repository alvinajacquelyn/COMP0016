Given that 581-nm lights have little direct effect on S-cones, TT2 must arise indirectly from the backgrounds' effects on the Land M-cones. We attribute the phenomenon to the action of an unknown L- and M-cone photobleaching product, X, which acts at their outputs like an \"equivalent\" background light that then inhibits Scones at a cone-opponent, second-site. The timecourse of TT2 is similar in form to the lifetime of X in a two-stage, first-order biochemical reaction A\u2192X\u2192C with successive best-fitting time-constants of 3.09 \u00b1 0.35 and 7.73 \u00b1 0.70 s. Alternatively, with an additional slowly recovering exponential \"restoringforce\" with a best-fitting time-constant 23.94 \u00b1 1.42 s, the two-stage best-fitting time-constants become 4.15 \u00b1 0.62 and 6.79 \u00b1 1.00 s. Because the time-constants are roughly independent of the background illumination, and thus the rate of photoisomerization, A\u2192X is likely to be a reaction subsidiary to the retinoid cycle, perhaps acting as a buffer when the bleaching rate is too high. X seems to be logarithmically related to S-cone threshold, which may result from the logarithmic cone-opponent, second-site response compression after multiplicative first-site adaptation. The restoring-force may be the same coneopponent force that sets the rate of S-cone recovery following the unusual threshold increase following the offset of dimmer yellow backgrounds, an effect known as \"transient-tritanopia\" (TT1).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cone-opponency", "Equivalent background", "Light adaptation", "Photopigment bleaching", "S-cones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Ocular", "Color Perception", "Cone Opsins", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Photic Stimulation", "Photobleaching", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinoids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049739119", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"7006086539": {"Name": "Stockman A.", "AuthorID": "7006086539", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7102449400": {"Name": "Henning G.B.", "AuthorID": "7102449400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57191329031": {"Name": "Rider A.T.", "AuthorID": "57191329031", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6604012461": {"Name": "Smithson H.E.", "AuthorID": "6604012461", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
