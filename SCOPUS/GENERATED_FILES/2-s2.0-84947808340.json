Thus, it is important to recognize severe disease and identify patients at higher risk of progression to severe disease. In this article, fibrotic lung disease and cardiac sarcoidosis are reviewed as the major contributors to sarcoidosis mortality and morbidity. In the absence of a standardized definition of severe pulmonary disease, a multidisciplinary approach to clinical staging is suggested, based on symptoms, pulmonary function tests, and imaging findings at presentation, integrated with the duration of disease and longitudinal disease behavior during early follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac sarcoidosis", "Pulmonary fibrosis", "Sarcoidosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Humans", "Lung Diseases", "Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Sarcoidosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947808340", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"24492319800": {"Name": "Kouranos V.", "AuthorID": "24492319800", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57200973324": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57200973324", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}}}
