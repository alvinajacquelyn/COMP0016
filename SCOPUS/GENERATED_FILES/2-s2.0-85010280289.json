Intradermal injection of treated sarcoidosis spleen tissue resulted in a granuloma response at injection site by 4-6 weeks. Previous work indicates proteins as the possible trigger of this reaction. We aimed to identify Kv-specific proteins and characterise the ex vivo response of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and healthy control patients when stimulated with both Kv and selected Kv-specific proteins. Methods: Kv extracts were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE and 2D-DIGE and then underwent mass spectrometric analysis for protein identification. Sarcoidosis and control PBMCs were first stimulated with Kv and then with three selected recombinant protein candidates which were identified from the proteomic analysis. PBMC secreted cytokines were subsequently measured by Multiplex Cytokine Assay. Results: We observed significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion from Kv-stimulated PBMCs of sarcoidosis patients vs. PBMCs from healthy volunteers (IFN-\u03b3: 207.2 pg/mL vs. 3.86 pg/mL, p = 0.0018; TNF-\u03b1: 2375 pg/mL vs. 42.82 pg/mL, p = 0.0003). Through proteomic approaches we then identified 74 sarcoidosis tissue-specific proteins. Of these, 3 proteins (vimentin, tubulin and alpha-actinin-4) were identified using both 1D-SDS-PAGE and 2D-DIGE. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005150. Increased cytokine secretion was subsequently observed with vimentin stimulation of sarcoidosis PBMCs vs. tuberculosis PBMCs (IFN-\u03b3: 396.6 pg/mL vs 0.1 pg/mL, p = 0.0009; TNF-\u03b1: 1139 pg/mL vs 0.1 pg/mL, p<0.0001). This finding was also observed in vimentin stimulation of sarcoidosis PBMCs compared to PBMCs from healthy controls (IFN-\u03b3: 396.6 pg/mL vs. 0.1 pg/mL, p = 0.014; TNF-\u03b1: 1139 pg/mL vs 42.29 pg/mL, p = 0.027). No difference was found in cytokine secretion between sarcoidosis and control PBMCs when stimulated with either tubulin or alpha-actinin-4. Conclusions: Stimulation with both Kveim reagent and vimentin induces a specific pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from sarcoidosis PBMCs. Further investigation of cellular immune responses to Kveim-specific proteins may identify novel biomarkers to assist the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "Female", "Humans", "Immunity, Cellular", "Indicators and Reagents", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proteomics", "Sarcoidosis", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010280289", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56673931600": {"Name": "Eberhardt C.", "AuthorID": "56673931600", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Unit, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57193068536": {"Name": "Parker R.", "AuthorID": "57193068536", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Unit, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "36337313000": {"Name": "Siddiqui N.", "AuthorID": "36337313000", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Unit, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "55200319400": {"Name": "Potiphar L.", "AuthorID": "55200319400", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Unit, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7403871863": {"Name": "Mitchell D.", "AuthorID": "7403871863", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Unit, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57195801728": {"Name": "Lalvani A.", "AuthorID": "57195801728", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Unit, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "55200789300": {"Name": "Thillai M.", "AuthorID": "55200789300", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Group, Papworth NHS Trust"}, "35242224200": {"Name": "Goldin R.", "AuthorID": "35242224200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pathology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7004011904": {"Name": "Timms J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004011904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60009009, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Imperial College London, NHS Healthcare Trust"}, "57189021157": {"Name": "Kon O.M.", "AuthorID": "57189021157", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital London, Imperial College London, NHS Healthcare Trust"}, "6603126683": {"Name": "Wickremasinghe M.", "AuthorID": "6603126683", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital London, Imperial College London, NHS Healthcare Trust"}, "8387705600": {"Name": "Weeks M.E.", "AuthorID": "8387705600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60012754, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute-a Cancer Research UK Centre of Excellence, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}}}
