Enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) hold great potential as power sources for such devices, since they can generate power from physiological fluids and operate at body temperature.In this study, we present a cascade of three EFCs embedded in a compact and handy single channel device and we demonstrate for the first time power generation from iontophoresis extracts obtained from pig skin. The EFCs implement non-toxic highly-porous gold electrodes; an easy-to-reproduce procedure is adopted for the immobilization of glucose oxidase and laccase at the anode and cathode respectively; no external mediators are used; and the system design can easily be further miniaturized.When electrically connected in parallel, the EFCs generated a power output close to the sum of the power generated by each unit, with peak values of 0.7. \u03bcW (flow-through mode) and 0.4. \u03bcW (batch mode), at a glucose concentration of 27. mM. When the device was fed with transdermal extracts, containing only 30. \u03bcM of glucose, the average peak power was proportionally lower (0.004. \u03bcW).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enzymatic fuel cell", "Glucose oxidase", "Highly porous gold", "Laccase", "Reverse iontophoresis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Glucose concentration", "Health monitoring", "Laccases", "Physiological fluids", "Porous gold", "Porous gold electrodes", "Reverse iontophoresis", "Single channel device", "Animals", "Bioelectric Energy Sources", "Enzymes, Immobilized", "Glucose", "Glucose Oxidase", "Laccase", "Skin", "Swine", "Tissue Extracts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949255194", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"55960343500": {"Name": "du Toit H.", "AuthorID": "55960343500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "56993291500": {"Name": "Rashidi R.", "AuthorID": "56993291500", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "26655418400": {"Name": "Di Lorenzo M.", "AuthorID": "26655418400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "56543549400": {"Name": "Ferdani D.", "AuthorID": "56543549400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath"}, "7003434711": {"Name": "Delgado-Charro M.", "AuthorID": "7003434711", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology"}, "39062173700": {"Name": "Sangan C.", "AuthorID": "39062173700", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Mechanical Engineering"}}}
