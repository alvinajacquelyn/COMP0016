The rapid evolution and availability of these data have revealed issues not addressed by existing reporting guidelines, such as Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement was created to fill these gaps. RECORD was created as an extension to the STROBE statement to address reporting items specific to observational studies using routinely collected health data. RECORD consists of a checklist of 13 items related to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion section of articles, and other information required for inclusion in such research reports. This document contains the checklist and explanatory and elaboration information to enhance the use of the checklist. Examples of good reporting for each RECORD checklist item are also included herein. This document, as well as the accompanying website and message board (http://www.record-statement.org), will enhance the implementation and understanding of RECORD. Through implementation of RECORD, authors, journals editors, and peer reviewers can encourage transparency of research reporting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Checklist", "Guidelines as Topic", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Research Design", "Research Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946077182", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"9736972600": {"Name": "Benchimol E.I.", "AuthorID": "9736972600", "AffiliationID": "60017829", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences"}, "7004302588": {"Name": "Guttmann A.", "AuthorID": "7004302588", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849, 60193840", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55249873300": {"Name": "Harron K.", "AuthorID": "55249873300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55490520500": {"Name": "Langan S.M.", "AuthorID": "55490520500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56350378600": {"Name": "Moher D.", "AuthorID": "56350378600", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "School of Epidemiology, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Peteresen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "36038149900": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen H.T.", "AuthorID": "36038149900", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University"}, "22735718100": {"Name": "von Elm E.", "AuthorID": "22735718100", "AffiliationID": "60022307, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane Switzerland, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Lausanne"}}}
