Models for such problems usually consist of encoders which decrease spatial resolution while learning a high-dimensional representation, followed by decoders who recover the original input resolution and result in low-dimensional predictions. While encoders have been studied rigorously, relatively few studies address the decoder side. This paper presents an extensive comparison of a variety of decoders for a variety of pixel-wise tasks ranging from classification, regression to synthesis. Our contributions are: (1) decoders matter: we observe significant variance in results between different types of decoders on various problems. (2) We introduce new residual-like connections for decoders. (3) We introduce a novel decoder: bilinear additive upsampling. (4) We explore prediction artifacts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D imagery", "Computer vision", "Decoders", "Depth prediction", "GANs", "Machine vision", "Neural network architectures", "Per-pixel prediction", "Semantic segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["2D imagery", "Decoders", "GANs", "High-dimensional", "Low dimensional", "Semantic segmentation", "Spatial resolution", "Up sampling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062943797", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57191072718": {"Name": "Wojna Z.", "AuthorID": "57191072718", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56398614700": {"Name": "Ferrari V.", "AuthorID": "56398614700", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google Inc."}, "6506759870": {"Name": "Guadarrama S.", "AuthorID": "6506759870", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google Inc."}, "36606887700": {"Name": "Silberman N.", "AuthorID": "36606887700", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google Inc."}, "56118862400": {"Name": "Chen L.C.", "AuthorID": "56118862400", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google Inc."}, "56533445400": {"Name": "Fathi A.", "AuthorID": "56533445400", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google Inc."}, "15021254100": {"Name": "Uijlings J.", "AuthorID": "15021254100", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google Inc."}}}
