Herein, we show HLA class I-restricted ticlopidine-specific CD8+ T-cell activation in healthy donors expressing HLA-A\u221733:03. Cloned CD8+ T-cells proliferated and secreted IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of ticlopidine and autologous antigen presenting cells. A reduction of the T-cell response after blocking with HLA-class I and HLA-A\u221733 antibodies indicates that the interaction between drugs and the HLA allele detected in genetic association studies may be important for T-cell activation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Genotype", "HLA-A Antigens", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Ticlopidine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053687536", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"56508945300": {"Name": "Usui T.", "AuthorID": "56508945300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "56597762400": {"Name": "Tailor A.", "AuthorID": "56597762400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7103404706": {"Name": "Faulkner L.", "AuthorID": "7103404706", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "15136654200": {"Name": "Meng X.", "AuthorID": "15136654200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "55568523244": {"Name": "Farrell J.", "AuthorID": "55568523244", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.K.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "6603779088": {"Name": "Naisbitt D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603779088", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Center for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7102328712": {"Name": "Daly A.K.", "AuthorID": "7102328712", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "7006504836": {"Name": "Dear G.J.", "AuthorID": "7006504836", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
