Here we seek to better understand why it still does not fail to convey a sensation of depth. To this end, four typical disparity distortions resulting from manual 2D-to-3D stereo conversion are analyzed: i) smooth remapping, ii) spatial smoothness, iii) motion-compensated, temporal smoothness, and iv) completeness. A perceptual experiment is conducted to quantify the impact of each distortion on the plausibility of the 3D impression relative to a reference without distortion. Close-to-natural videos with known depth were distorted in one of the four above-mentioned aspects and subjects had to indicate if the distortion still allows for a plausible 3D effect. The smallest amounts of distortion that result in a significant rejection suggests a conservative upper bound on the quality requirement of 2D-to-3D conversion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["2D-To-3D", "2d-to-3d conversions", "3D effects", "Quality requirements", "Remapping", "Semi-automatics", "Spatial smoothness", "Upper Bound"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955588355", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"55250016000": {"Name": "Kellnhofer P.", "AuthorID": "55250016000", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "MPI Informatik"}, "57079088200": {"Name": "Leimk\u00fchler T.", "AuthorID": "57079088200", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "MPI Informatik"}, "24537726600": {"Name": "Ritschel T.", "AuthorID": "24537726600", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "MPI Informatik"}, "55888212000": {"Name": "Myszkowski K.", "AuthorID": "55888212000", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "MPI Informatik"}, "7202927645": {"Name": "Seidel H.", "AuthorID": "7202927645", "AffiliationID": "60000256", "AffiliationName": "MPI Informatik"}}}
