Although new modelling and forecasting tools are increasing the availability of mitigation options, further work is needed to consolidate good policies and practices. This paper presents a case study on London, United Kingdom (UK). It develops an integrative research process with local stakeholders aimed at applying the theory of cascading disasters in London's response and preparedness strategies. A mixed method approach is adopted to explore the awareness of cascading risk, the perception of possible mitigation measures, and the current levels of training amongst the stakeholders of the London Resilience Partnerships. Specific items investigate the relation of cascades with cross- border crisis management, and climate change. The results propose new quantitative and qualitative evidence that highlights the divergence between risk awareness and its integration in policies and practices, discussing options for improving multi- agency coordination and organisational resilience. The conclusions define a list of actions that should be strategic priorities for policies and decision makers, such as the improvement of inter-modal coordination and the release of open access guidelines, proposing new open questions for scholars in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042200923", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"55991538100": {"Name": "Pescaroli G.", "AuthorID": "55991538100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
