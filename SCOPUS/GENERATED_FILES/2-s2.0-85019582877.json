Endoscopic intervention is often effective permitting rapid discharge. An efficient service would permit rapid discharge for patients who are often at the end of life. We noted that a majority of patients in hospital under the gastroenterological oncology were admitted with symptoms requiring therapeutic endoscopy. Methods: We conducted an audit cycle of the inpatient days before and after pathway implementation. A wait of 1 day was set as acceptable for patients with bleeding as defined by NICE guidance and we set an arbitrary standard of 2 days for patients without bleeding but requiring therapeutic endoscopy. Between the audit cycles, a pathway was built to accommodate these patients. Results: Inpatient waits improved from a median of 3 days to 1 day. There was no difference in outcome between those presenting with bleeding and other symptoms or any difference in patients requiring different procedures. Conclusions: Waiting times for endoscopy can be improved with the introduction of a targeted pathway of cancer patients. Further issues including cost, quality of life and nutrition require further intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audit cycle", "Endoscopic procedures", "Gastrointestinal oncology", "Waiting times"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digestive System Neoplasms", "Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal", "Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Quality of Life", "Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019582877", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57194272066": {"Name": "Singer R.", "AuthorID": "57194272066", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "57217415112": {"Name": "Campbell P.", "AuthorID": "57217415112", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "57217659495": {"Name": "Fernandes C.", "AuthorID": "57217659495", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "55448048100": {"Name": "Statham P.", "AuthorID": "55448048100", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "6701713285": {"Name": "Hochhauser D.", "AuthorID": "6701713285", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
