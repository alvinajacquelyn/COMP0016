The reactive fluid aqueous pH remained relatively stable at pH 6.7 throughout the experiment. Aqueous Mg concentration maximized after approximately 2years time at 3\u00d710-5mol/kg, whereas aqueous Si concentrations increased continuously with time, reaching 2\u00d710-5mol/kg after 5years. Element release rates closely matched those determined on this same forsterite sample during short-term abiotic open system experiments for the first 10days, then slowed substantially such that the Mg and Si release rates are approximately an order of magnitude slower than that calculated from the short-term abiotic experiments. Post-experiment analysis reveals that secondary hematite, a substantial biotic community, and minor amorphous silica formed on the dissolving forsterite during the experiment. The biotic community included bacteria, dominated by Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria), and fungi, dominated by Trichocomaceae, that grew in a carbon and nutrient-limited media on the dissolving forsterite. The Mg isotope composition of the reactive fluid was near constant after 2years but 0.25\u2030 heavier in \u03b426Mg than the dissolving forsterite. Together these results suggest long-term forsterite dissolution in natural Earth surface systems maybe substantially slower than that estimated from short-term abiotic experiments due to the growth of biotic communities on their surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942549448", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"35280527300": {"Name": "Oelkers E.", "AuthorID": "35280527300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "45761422700": {"Name": "Mavromatis V.", "AuthorID": "45761422700", "AffiliationID": "60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Geosciences, Graz University of Technology"}, "6701822771": {"Name": "Benning L.", "AuthorID": "6701822771", "AffiliationID": "60030245", "AffiliationName": "GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Telegrafenberg"}, "56197230000": {"Name": "Lutz S.", "AuthorID": "56197230000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, The University of Leeds"}, "8578236500": {"Name": "Pearce C.", "AuthorID": "8578236500", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "National Oceanography Centre, University of Southampton Waterfront Campus"}, "26650169000": {"Name": "Pl\u00fcmper O.", "AuthorID": "26650169000", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Utrecht University"}}}
