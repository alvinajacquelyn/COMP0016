MICs were determined according to CLSI standards and additionally using five overlapping sets of twofold dilutions. Matrix effect: (a) free drug MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) for all drugs were significantly higher in FBS than in CAMHB for both pathogens (p < 0.001); (b) MICs and MBCs were higher for CAMHB and FBS compared to RPMI for P. multocida only. Net growth rate for P. multocida in CAMHB was significantly slower than in FBS and higher than in RPMI, correlating to MIC and MBC ranking. Drug effect: doxycycline MICs and MBCs were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in both CAMHB and FBS than tetracycline and oxytetracycline for both pathogens. Only for M. haemolytica were oxytetracycline MIC and MBC significantly lower than tetracycline, precluding the use of tetracycline to predict oxytetracycline susceptibility in this species. Determining potencies of tetracyclines in a physiological medium, such as FBS, is proposed, when the objective is correlation with pharmacokinetic data for dosage determination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["doxycycline", "Mannheimia haemolytica", "minimum inhibitory concentration", "oxytetracycline", "Pasteurella multocida"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Culture Media", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Doxycycline", "Mannheimia haemolytica", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Oxytetracycline", "Pasteurella multocida", "Tetracycline"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054091154", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"57204013168": {"Name": "Mead A.", "AuthorID": "57204013168", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "7102526015": {"Name": "Lees P.", "AuthorID": "7102526015", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "7101675867": {"Name": "Toutain P.L.", "AuthorID": "7101675867", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "16234179600": {"Name": "Pelligand L.", "AuthorID": "16234179600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "56418784600": {"Name": "Mitchell J.", "AuthorID": "56418784600", "AffiliationID": "100333295", "AffiliationName": "Veterinary Medicines Directorate"}, "7003977916": {"Name": "Rycroft A.", "AuthorID": "7003977916", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Science, Royal Veterinary College"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
