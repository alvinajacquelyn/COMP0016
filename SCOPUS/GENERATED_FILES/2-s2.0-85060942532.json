We report that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) from healthy females produced more type 1 IFN after toll like receptor (TLR) 7 signaling than males, even before puberty, but that puberty itself associated with increased production of type 1 IFN. A unique human model allows us to show that this was related to X chromosome number, and serum testosterone concentration, in a manner which differed depending on the number of X chromosomes present. In addition, we have showed that pDC were more activated in females overall, and immune cell TLR7 gene expression was higher in females after puberty. Therefore, sex hormones and X chromosome number were associated individually and interactively with the type 1 IFN response, which contributes to our understanding of why females are more likely to develop an IFN mediated disease like jSLE after puberty.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunity", "Interferon", "Puberty", "Sex", "Sex hormone", "SLE", "TLR7", "X Chromosome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "B7-2 Antigen", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Chromosomes, Human, X", "Cytokines", "Dendritic Cells", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Gonadal Steroid Hormones", "Humans", "Interferon Type I", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Puberty", "Sex Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 7"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060942532", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"23096710600": {"Name": "Webb K.", "AuthorID": "23096710600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, ULCH and GOSH"}, "57194450684": {"Name": "Peckham H.", "AuthorID": "57194450684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, ULCH and GOSH"}, "57070212800": {"Name": "Radziszewska A.", "AuthorID": "57070212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, ULCH and GOSH"}, "57191204271": {"Name": "Deakin C.T.", "AuthorID": "57191204271", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "III Programme UCL GOS Institute for Child Health"}, "15021974200": {"Name": "Ciurtin C.", "AuthorID": "15021974200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, ULCH and GOSH"}, "57203684378": {"Name": "Wedderburn L.R.", "AuthorID": "57203684378", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "III Programme UCL GOS Institute for Child Health"}, "7003289700": {"Name": "Ioannou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003289700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, ULCH and GOSH"}, "56714917200": {"Name": "Menon M.", "AuthorID": "56714917200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, UCL"}, "6602473832": {"Name": "Oliveri P.", "AuthorID": "6602473832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, Nanostring Facility, UCL"}, "9635004000": {"Name": "Simpson F.", "AuthorID": "9635004000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, Nanostring Facility, UCL"}, "57205650342": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57205650342", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Statistics Courses, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "7101909468": {"Name": "Butler G.", "AuthorID": "7101909468", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
