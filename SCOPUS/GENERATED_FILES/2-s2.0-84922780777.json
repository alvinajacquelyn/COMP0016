Rituximab (RTX) combined with plasma-exchange (PEX) is an effective treatment in TTP. Patients can remain in remission for extended periods following PEX/RTX, and this is associated with continuing reduction in antibodies to ADAMTS13. Factors controlling B cell differentiation to autoantibody production, including stimulation through the B cell receptor and interactions with the B cell-activating factor (BAFF), may thus impact length of remission. In this cross-sectional study, we measured naive and memory B cell phenotypes [using CD19/immunoglobulin (Ig)D/CD27] following PEX/RTX treatment in TTP patients at B cell return (n=6) and in 12 patients in remission 10-68 months post-RTX. We also investigated relationships among serum BAFF, soluble CD23 (sCD23- a surrogate measure of acquiring B memory (CD27+) phenotype) and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) expression. At B cell return after PEX/RTX, naive B cells predominated and BAFF-R expression was reduced compared to healthy controls (P<0\u00b7001). In the remission group, despite numbers of CD19+ B cells within normal limits in most patients, the percentage and absolute numbers of pre-switch and memory B cells remained low, with sCD23 levels at the lower end of the normal range. BAFF levels were correlated inversely with BAFF-R expression and time after therapy. In conclusion, the long-term effects of RTX therapy in patients with TTP included slow regeneration of memory B cell subsets and persistently reduced BAFF-R expression across all B cell subpopulations. This may reflect the delay in selection and differentiation of potentially autoreactive (ADAMTS13-specific) B cells, resulting in relatively long periods of low disease activity after therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B cells", "BAFF", "BAFF-R", "Rituximab", "TTP"], "IndexKeywords": ["ADAM Proteins", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived", "Antigens, CD", "Autoantibodies", "B-Cell Activating Factor", "B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor", "B-Lymphocyte Subsets", "B-Lymphocytes", "Biomarkers", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Immunophenotyping", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Plasma Exchange", "Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic", "Rituximab", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922780777", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"35486690600": {"Name": "Becerra E.", "AuthorID": "35486690600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London"}, "6602679104": {"Name": "Leandro M.", "AuthorID": "6602679104", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7003344107": {"Name": "Cambridge G.", "AuthorID": "7003344107", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London"}, "8709944400": {"Name": "Scully M.", "AuthorID": "8709944400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "56051733200": {"Name": "Heelas E.", "AuthorID": "56051733200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "55622350600": {"Name": "Westwood J.", "AuthorID": "55622350600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "26531004200": {"Name": "De La Torre I.", "AuthorID": "26531004200", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Reumatolog\u00eda, Hospital Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n"}}}
