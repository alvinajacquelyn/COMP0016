We used a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique to assess the physiologic connections between primary visual (V1) and motor (M1) areas in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). We hypothesized that in PPR-positive patients, M1 would respond excessively to inputs from V1. Methods Eleven photosensitive patients with IGE who had a PPR at the time of the study were compared with 10 similar patients without a PPR, and with 11 healthy subjects of similar age and sex. The connection between V1 and M1 was assessed in resting participants by delivering a conditioning stimulus (CS) over the phosphene hotspot of the visual cortex (intensity 90% phosphene threshold, PT) followed at random interstimulus intervals (ISIs; 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 35 and 40 msec) by a test stimulus (TS) over the left motor cortex to elicit a motor evoked potential (MEP) of ~1 mV from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Results In healthy subjects, a CS over V1 suppressed M1 at ISIs between 18 and 40 msec. Similar effects occurred in IGE patients without a PPR. This was not true in PPR-positive IGE patients, in whom this type of physiologic inhibition was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. Significance IGE patients with a PPR have an overactive functional response of M1 to inputs traveling from V1. This may represent one core factor for the anterior spread of the PPR itself and for the origin of the abnormal epileptic motor phenomenon, such as myoclonus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Functional connectivity", "Generalized epilepsy", "Motor cortex", "Photoparoxysmal response", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation", "Visual cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Epilepsies, Myoclonic", "Epilepsy, Generalized", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Cortex", "Neural Pathways", "Photic Stimulation", "Photosensitivity Disorders", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946474805", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"18635502800": {"Name": "Strigaro G.", "AuthorID": "18635502800", "AffiliationID": "60003668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medicine, Section of Neurology, University of Piemonte Orientale A.
