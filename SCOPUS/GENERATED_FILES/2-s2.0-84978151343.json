Methods: A UK adult education charity ran four singing classes, two craft classes and a creative writing class for the purpose of this study. Written responses to open questions about health, well-being and social lives were collected from participants at the end of the 7-month courses. Results: The classes enhanced well-being by improving mood and providing a sense of belonging. The classes helped participants develop self-confidence, create and strengthen relationships, and encouraged more active lives. Participants valued meeting people from their community and used these ties to access information about local opportunities. However, some participants reported negative experiences linked to unfavourable self\u2013other comparison. Conclusions: These results highlight how regular adult education classes involving creativity can enhance well-being and help community integration regardless of the subject studied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mental health", "Self-efficacy", "social capital"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978151343", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57026310700": {"Name": "Pearce E.", "AuthorID": "57026310700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
