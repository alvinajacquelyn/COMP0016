Such lapses limit the accuracy and speed of many psychophysical measurements. This study evaluates an automated technique for detecting lapses based on body movement (postural instability). Thirty-five children (8\u201311 years of age) and 34 adults performed a typical psychophysical task (orientation discrimination) while seated on a Wii Fit Balance Board: a gaming device that measures center of pressure (CoP). Incorrect responses on suprathreshold catch trials provided the \u201creference standard\u201d measure of when lapses in concentration occurred. Children exhibited significantly greater variability in CoP on lapse trials, indicating that postural instability provides a feasible, real-time index of concentration. Limitations and potential applications of this method are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attentiveness", "Catch trials", "Center of pressure", "Children", "Concentration", "Lapse rates", "Postural instability", "Psychophysics", "Receiver operating characteristic", "Task engagement", "Test development", "Wii Fit Balance Board"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Postural Balance", "Pressure", "Psychophysics", "ROC Curve", "Sitting Position", "Video Games", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047160468", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.R.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University of London"}}}
