We investigated the evolution of mouse hind-limb muscle microstructure using diffusion imaging of in vivo and in vitro samples from both actively growing and mature mice. Mean apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were determined as a function of diffusion time (\u0394), age (7.5, 22 and 44 weeks) and diffusion gradient direction, applied parallel or transverse to the principal axis of the muscle fibres. We investigated a wide range of diffusion times with the goal of probing a range of diffusion lengths characteristic of muscle microstructure. We compared the diffusion time-dependent ADC of hind-limb muscles with histology. ADC was found to vary as a function of diffusion time in muscles at all stages of maturation. Muscle water diffusivity was higher in younger (7.5 weeks) than in adult (22 and 44 weeks) mice, whereas no differences were observed between the older ages. In vitro data showed the same diffusivity pattern as in vivo data. The highlighted differences in diffusion properties between young and mature muscles suggested differences in underlying muscle microstructure, which were confirmed by histological assessment. In particular, although diffusion was more restricted in older muscle, muscle fibre size increased significantly from young to adult age. The extracellular space decreased with age by only ~1%. This suggests that the observed diffusivity differences between young and adult muscles may be caused by increased membrane permeability in younger muscle associated with properties of the sarcolemma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apparent diffusion coefficient", "diffusion MRI", "diffusion-weighted imaging", "hind-limb muscles", "histology", "maturation", "mouse", "time-dependent diffusion MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apparent diffusion coefficient", "Diffusion mris", "Diffusion weighted imaging", "Hind limbs", "maturation", "mouse", "Time-dependent diffusion", "Aging", "Animals", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Evans Blue", "Hindlimb", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Muscle, Skeletal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040168552", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"24177280400": {"Name": "Porcari P.", "AuthorID": "24177280400", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine and Centre for In Vivo Imaging, Newcastle University"}, "56377599000": {"Name": "Hall M.G.", "AuthorID": "56377599000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "24477276100": {"Name": "Greally E.", "AuthorID": "24477276100", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7003355969": {"Name": "Straub V.", "AuthorID": "7003355969", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7005859645": {"Name": "Blamire A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005859645", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine and Centre for In Vivo Imaging, Newcastle University"}}}
