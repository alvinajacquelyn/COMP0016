Simulations are conducted using a front-tracking approach, whereby Lagrangian hypersurfaces are used to model the interface between materials. These 'fronts' are overlaid on an Eulerian grid which is used to model the bulk flow. Results are compared to an experimental investigation, in which a light gas gun is used to create \u223c600 MPa shock waves in hydrogel blocks, within which air cavities have been cast. Experimental results are presented, including temporally resolved measurements of light emission. Comparison between experimental and simulated results shows good agreement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Eulerian grids", "Experimental investigations", "Front tracking approaches", "Hyper-surfaces", "Light gas gun", "Numerical and experimental study", "Simulated results", "Temporally resolved measurements"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956864324", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55764160000": {"Name": "Betney M.R.", "AuthorID": "55764160000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "57216242490": {"Name": "Anderson P.A.", "AuthorID": "57216242490", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "35795257800": {"Name": "Doyle H.", "AuthorID": "35795257800", "AffiliationID": "60113431", "AffiliationName": "First Light Fusion Ltd."}, "27667929500": {"Name": "Tully B.", "AuthorID": "27667929500", "AffiliationID": "60113431", "AffiliationName": "First Light Fusion Ltd."}, "55320006600": {"Name": "Hawker N.A.", "AuthorID": "55320006600", "AffiliationID": "60113431", "AffiliationName": "First Light Fusion Ltd."}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
