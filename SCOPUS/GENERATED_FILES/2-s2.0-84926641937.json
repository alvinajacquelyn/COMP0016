Bone resorption results in the release of large amounts of calcium into the extracellular fluid (ECF), but it is not certain whether changes in extracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]e influence osteoclast formation and resorption. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of [Ca2+]e and NAADP, a potent calcium mobilising messenger that induces calcium uptake, on human osteoclast formation and resorption. CD14+ human monocytes were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL in the presence of different concentrations of calcium and NAADP and the effect on osteoclast formation and resorption evaluated. We found that the number of TRAP+ multinucleated cells and the extent of lacunar resorption were reduced when there was an increase in extracellular calcium and NAADP. This was associated with a decrease in RANK mRNA expression by CD14? cells. At high concentrations (20 mM) of [Ca2+]e mature osteoclast resorption activity remained unaltered relative to control cultures. Our findings indicate that osteoclast formation is inhibited by a rise in [Ca2?]e and that RANK expression by mononuclear phagocyte osteoclast precursors is also [Ca2+]e dependent. Changes in NAADP also influence osteoclast formation, suggesting a role for this molecule in calcium handling. Osteoclasts remained capable of lacunar resorption, even at high ECF [Ca2+]e, in keeping with their role in physiological and pathological bone resorption.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium", "NAADP", "Osteoclast", "RANK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Resorption", "Calcium", "Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Monocytes", "NADP", "Osteoclasts", "RANK Ligand"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926641937", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"26649397800": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "26649397800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, University of Oxford"}, "56431060500": {"Name": "Hookway E.S.", "AuthorID": "56431060500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, University of Oxford"}, "8575653200": {"Name": "Kashima T.", "AuthorID": "8575653200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, University of Oxford"}, "7006473645": {"Name": "Oppermann U.", "AuthorID": "7006473645", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Oxford"}, "7006334937": {"Name": "Galione A.", "AuthorID": "7006334937", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford"}, "35492908800": {"Name": "Athanasou N.A.", "AuthorID": "35492908800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, University of Oxford"}}}
