METHODS : A web-based survey involving the 47 countries of the African Region was conducted between November 2016 and April 2017. RESULT S : The questionnaire was completed by 32/47 (68.1%) National TB Programme managers or their delegates. LTBI guidelines were available in four countries (12.5%), while 13 (40.6%) had an LTBI section in their national TB guidelines; there was no significant association with socio-economic conditions and funding allocation. LTBI diagnosis was mostly based on clinical evaluation to rule out active disease, rather than on systematic use of the tuberculin skin test. Respectively 23 (71.8%) and 17 countries (53.1%) reported providing treatment to child contacts aged <5 years and people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). Over two thirds of respondent countries had ongoing activities targeting at least one of the aforementioned high-risk groups. A recording and reporting system for LTBI-related data on child contacts and PLHIV was available in respectively 14 and 12 countries; 7 countries had an LTBI monitoring and evaluation plan. CONCLUS IONS : These data suggest that greater effort is needed to appropriately scale up LTBI policies in the African Region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High-risk populations", "LTBI", "Policy", "Screening", "TB prevention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa", "Communicable Disease Control", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Internet", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Population Surveillance", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040785092", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6507327565": {"Name": "Sulis G.", "AuthorID": "6507327565", "AffiliationID": "60029502, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill International TB Centre, McGill University, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health"}, "12772429700": {"Name": "Capone S.", "AuthorID": "12772429700", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60027142", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "55882979800": {"Name": "Giorgetti P.F.", "AuthorID": "55882979800", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60027142", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "7006442223": {"Name": "Matteelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006442223", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60027142", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "35478992500": {"Name": "Carvalho A.C.C.", "AuthorID": "35478992500", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Innovation in Therapies, Education and Bioproducts, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro"}, "57200318287": {"Name": "Da Silva Martins P.", "AuthorID": "57200318287", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Innovation in Therapies, Education and Bioproducts, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro"}, "57192153780": {"Name": "Hamada Y.", "AuthorID": "57192153780", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "TB/HIV and Community Engagement Unit, Global Tuberculosis Programme, World Health Organization"}, "55886401400": {"Name": "Getahun H.", "AuthorID": "55886401400", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "TB/HIV and Community Engagement Unit, Global Tuberculosis Programme, World Health Organization"}}}
