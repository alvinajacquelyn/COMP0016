DNAJ/Hsp40 (heat shock protein 40)proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution and mediate the folding of nascent proteins, and the unfolding, refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins while assisting in associated-membrane translocation. DNAJC13 is one of five DNAJ \u2018C\u2019 class chaperone variants implicated in monogenic parkinsonism. Here we examine the effect of the DNAJC13 disease-linked mutation (p.Asn855Ser)on its interacting partners, focusing on sorting nexin 1 (SNX1)membrane dynamics in primary cortical neurons derived from a novel Dnajc13 p.Asn855Ser knock-in (DKI)mouse model. Dnajc13 p.Asn855Ser mutant and wild type protein expression were equivalent in mature heterozygous cultures (DIV21). While SNX1-positive puncta density, area, and WASH-retromer assembly were comparable between cultures derived from DKI and wild type littermates, the formation of SNX1-enriched tubules in DKI neuronal cultures was significantly increased. Thus, Dnajc13 p.Asn855Ser disrupts SNX1 membrane-tubulation and trafficking, analogous to results from RME-8 depletion studies. The data suggest the mutation confers a dominant-negative gain-of-function in RME-8. Implications for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNAJC13", "Parkinson's disease", "Retromer", "RME-8", "SNX1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Cells, Cultured", "Endosomes", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Molecular Chaperones", "Neurons", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Protein Transport", "Sorting Nexins", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065799136", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57153865700": {"Name": "Follett J.", "AuthorID": "57153865700", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "57196421135": {"Name": "Fox J.D.", "AuthorID": "57196421135", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "55959825700": {"Name": "Gustavsson E.K.", "AuthorID": "55959825700", "AffiliationID": "60023052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St. Olav's Hospital"}, "56713030200": {"Name": "Kadgien C.", "AuthorID": "56713030200", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "24544440800": {"Name": "Munsie L.N.", "AuthorID": "24544440800", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "51664639300": {"Name": "Cao L.P.", "AuthorID": "51664639300", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "56375023700": {"Name": "Tatarnikov I.", "AuthorID": "56375023700", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "14018533400": {"Name": "Milnerwood A.J.", "AuthorID": "14018533400", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "35380197600": {"Name": "Farrer M.J.", "AuthorID": "35380197600", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}}}
