Methods: The investigation included 14,575 participants, aged 47 to 78 years at cognitive assessment in 2006-2008 from Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland), and 6 Czech towns participating in the HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol, and Psychosocial Factors in Eastern Europe) prospective cohort study. Average response rates were 59% at baseline (2002-2005) and 63% in 2006-2008. Alcohol consumption was assessed at baseline and in 2006-2008. Cognitive tests included immediate and delayed word recall, semantic fluency (animal naming), and letter cancellation. Associations between alcohol indices and cognitive scores were analyzed crosssectionally (all measures from 2006 to 2008) and prospectively (alcohol and covariates from 2002 to 2005 and cognition from 2006 to 2008). Results: In cross-sectional analyses, nondrinkers had lower cognitive scores and female moderate drinkers had better cognitive performance than light drinkers. Heavy, binge, and problem drinking were not consistently associated with cognitive function. Few associations were replicated in prospective analyses. Participants who stopped drinking during follow-up had worse cognition than stable drinkers; in men, regression coefficients (95% confidence interval) ranged from 20.26 (20.36, 20.16) for immediate recall to 20.14 (20.24, 20.04) for fluency. Conclusion: Regular and episodic heavy drinking were not consistently associated with cognitive function. Worse cognition in participants who stopped drinking during follow-up suggests that inclusion of less healthy ex-drinkers may partly explain poorer cognition in nondrinkers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drinking Behavior", "Europe, Eastern", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Regression Analysis", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925940741", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54684201600": {"Name": "Horvat P.", "AuthorID": "54684201600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8681509900": {"Name": "Peasey A.", "AuthorID": "8681509900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35418876900": {"Name": "Marmot M.", "AuthorID": "35418876900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60106085, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1018, Hopital Paul Brousse"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, University College London"}, "6701399454": {"Name": "Kubinova R.", "AuthorID": "6701399454", "AffiliationID": "60012911", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Public Health"}, "7004784461": {"Name": "Pajak A.", "AuthorID": "7004784461", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagellonian University Collegium Medicum"}, "6603876724": {"Name": "Malyutina S.", "AuthorID": "6603876724", "AffiliationID": "60069084", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State Medical University"}, "56221217700": {"Name": "Shishkin S.", "AuthorID": "56221217700", "AffiliationID": "60070539, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Siberian Branch under the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences"}}}
