This is the first report of Neochoristodera from Japan. However, the brevirostrine Monjurosuchus has already been reported from the same deposit, and the long-necked Shokawa was recovered from the Okurodani Formation, which is a lateral equivalent of the Kuwajima Formation. This new material demonstrates that the three known choristoderan morphotypes (short-necked longirostrine, short-necked brevirostrine and long-necked brevirostrine) were all present in the Early Cretaceous deposits of the Tetori Group. Until now, the Jiufotang Formation of China was the only deposit where all three were known to have co-occurred.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biogeography", "Choristodera", "Cretaceous", "Japan", "Neochoristodera"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924129870", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"18537006400": {"Name": "Matsumoto R.", "AuthorID": "18537006400", "AffiliationID": "60103897", "AffiliationName": "National Museum of Nature and Science"}, "7102556408": {"Name": "Manabe M.", "AuthorID": "7102556408", "AffiliationID": "60103897", "AffiliationName": "National Museum of Nature and Science"}, "57221028950": {"Name": "Evans S.E.", "AuthorID": "57221028950", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, UCL, University College London"}}}
