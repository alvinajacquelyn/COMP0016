Here, we assess the interplay of splicing repression by hnRNPC and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in the quality control and evolution of new Alu-exons. We identify 3100 new Alu-exons and show that NMD more efficiently recognises transcripts with Alu-exons compared to other exons with premature termination codons. However, some Alu-exons escape NMD, especially when an adjacent intron is retained, highlighting the importance of concerted repression by splicing and NMD. We show that evolutionary progression of 3\u2019 splice sites is coupled with longer repressive uridine tracts. Once the 3\u2019 splice site at ancient Alu-exons reaches a stable phase, splicing repression by hnRNPC decreases, but the exons generally remain sensitive to NMD. We conclude that repressive motifs are strongest next to cryptic exons and that gradual weakening of these motifs contributes to the evolutionary emergence of new alternative exons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alu Elements", "Evolution, Molecular", "Exons", "HEK293 Cells", "Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group C", "Humans", "Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay", "RNA Splicing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996477162", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"54406528900": {"Name": "Attig J.", "AuthorID": "54406528900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "56011236900": {"Name": "De Los Mozos I.R.", "AuthorID": "56011236900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "55356372800": {"Name": "Haberman N.", "AuthorID": "55356372800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "50561341600": {"Name": "Emmett W.", "AuthorID": "50561341600", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57211348250": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57211348250", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60105781", "AffiliationName": "Institute de Biologie de l\u2019ENS (IBENS), CNRS UMR"}, "14828354300": {"Name": "Zarnack K.", "AuthorID": "14828354300", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS), Goethe University Frankfurt"}, "15754355700": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig J.", "AuthorID": "15754355700", "AffiliationID": "112648326", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB)"}}}
