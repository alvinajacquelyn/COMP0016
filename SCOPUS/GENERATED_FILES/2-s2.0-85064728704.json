A major obstacle, however, is that the widely used agonist clozapine N-oxide undergoes conversion to clozapine, which penetrates the blood-brain barrier but has an unfavorable side effect profile. Perlapine has been reported to activate DREADDs at nanomolar concentrations but is not approved for use in humans by the Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency, limiting its translational potential. Here, we report that the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine, widely available in various formulations, is a potent agonist of the human M4 muscarinic receptor-based DREADD, facilitating clinical translation of chemogenetics to treat central nervous system diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atypical antipsychotics", "Blood-brain barrier", "Central nervous systems", "Clinical translation", "European medicines agencies", "Food and Drug Administration", "Muscarinic receptor", "Nanomolar concentration", "Computer Simulation", "Designer Drugs", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Olanzapine", "Receptor, Muscarinic M4", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064728704", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57208422625": {"Name": "Weston M.", "AuthorID": "57208422625", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203242637": {"Name": "Carpenter J.C.", "AuthorID": "57203242637", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56650876400": {"Name": "Snowball A.", "AuthorID": "56650876400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55191395200": {"Name": "Knauss S.", "AuthorID": "55191395200", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60000762, 60126120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neurology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"}, "54401141400": {"Name": "Lignani G.", "AuthorID": "54401141400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6507085620": {"Name": "Schorge S.", "AuthorID": "6507085620", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "37034425400": {"Name": "Lieb A.", "AuthorID": "37034425400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56436760400": {"Name": "Kaserer T.", "AuthorID": "56436760400", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56403842100": {"Name": "Wu A.", "AuthorID": "56403842100", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland"}, "12792927000": {"Name": "Mouravlev A.", "AuthorID": "12792927000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland"}, "25935582800": {"Name": "Young D.", "AuthorID": "25935582800", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland"}, "24339858200": {"Name": "Von Schimmelmann M.", "AuthorID": "24339858200", "AffiliationID": "117078416", "AffiliationName": "Ovid Therapeutics Inc."}, "7005720022": {"Name": "During M.J.", "AuthorID": "7005720022", "AffiliationID": "117078416", "AffiliationName": "Ovid Therapeutics Inc."}}}
