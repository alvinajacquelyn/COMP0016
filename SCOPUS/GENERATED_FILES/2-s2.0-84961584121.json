It explores the use of PPG sensor to capture pulse arrival time (PAT). Based on the same principal of using Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) to assess DPN, this paper proposes a platform which integrated two PPG sensors and one 2-lead ECG sensor to detect the difference in PAT (pulse arrive time on the finger compare to the time when the pulse reaches the ankle) as a surrogate measure for evaluating the progression of DPN. Preliminary results show that PAT increases when a pressure was applied onto upper leg using a blood pressure cuff simulating arterial stiffness/DPN. It shows that PDN can potentially be quantified by measuring PAT by using the proposed platform.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BSN", "Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy", "PPG", "Pulse Arrival Time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arterial stiffness", "Blood pressure cuff", "Multi-sensor platforms", "Peripheral neuropathy", "Pulse arrival time", "Pulse wave velocity", "Sensing platforms", "Surrogate measures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961584121", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"56323409900": {"Name": "Chen C.M.", "AuthorID": "56323409900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "57015488300": {"Name": "Onyenso K.", "AuthorID": "57015488300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "55539304100": {"Name": "Yang G.Z.", "AuthorID": "55539304100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "15834859900": {"Name": "Lo B.", "AuthorID": "15834859900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}}}
