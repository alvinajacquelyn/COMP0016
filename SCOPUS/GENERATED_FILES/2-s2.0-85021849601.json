A Freedom of Information request was made to the NHS Litigation Authority for claims data related to hand injuries in English Emergency Departments from 2004 to 2014. All successful hand injury claims against an individual DGH ED were also analysed. Two hundred and eighteen successful claims were made, costing a total of \u00a36,273,688.22. Diagnosis error was the most common successful claim (97). Four successful claims were brought against the Emergency Department. Causes of error included the use of inappropriate views and failure to correlate imaging with clinical findings. Hand injury diagnostic error has been the most common cause of successful litigious claims against Emergency Departments over the past 10 years. This paper demonstrates that fracture recognition and clinical diagnosis of hand injuries are key areas to target to reduce error rates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emergency Department", "error", "Hand injury", "litigation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Diagnostic Errors", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Hand Injuries", "Humans", "Jurisprudence", "Male", "Medical Errors", "Risk Assessment", "State Medicine", "X-Ray Film"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021849601", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56113507100": {"Name": "Trevatt A.E.", "AuthorID": "56113507100", "AffiliationID": "60019326, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Barnet Hospital, Hertfordshire"}, "54881691700": {"Name": "Smith O.J.", "AuthorID": "54881691700", "AffiliationID": "60019326, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Barnet Hospital, Hertfordshire"}, "57194731266": {"Name": "Needleman J.", "AuthorID": "57194731266", "AffiliationID": "60019326, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Barnet Hospital, Hertfordshire"}, "57212417445": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "57212417445", "AffiliationID": "60019326, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Barnet Hospital, Hertfordshire"}}}
