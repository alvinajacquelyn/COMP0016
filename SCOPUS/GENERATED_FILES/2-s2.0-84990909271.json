Here, we have examined the expression of several tumor suppressors upon fasting in mice. Interestingly, p21 mRNA is uniquely induced in all the tissues tested, particularly in liver and muscle (>10 fold), and this upregulation is independent of p53. Remarkably, in contrast to wild-type mice, p21-null mice become severely morbid after prolonged fasting. The defective adaptation to fasting of p21-null mice is associated to elevated energy expenditure, accelerated depletion of fat stores, and premature activation of protein catabolism in the muscle. Analysis of the liver transcriptome and cell-based assays revealed that the absence of p21 partially impairs the transcriptional program of PPAR\u03b1, a key regulator of fasting metabolism. Finally, treatment of p21-null mice with a PPAR\u03b1 agonist substantially protects them from their accelerated loss of fat upon fasting. We conclude that p21 plays a relevant role in fasting adaptation through the positive regulation of PPAR\u03b1.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21", "Fasting", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "PPAR alpha", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990909271", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55078367000": {"Name": "Lopez-Guadamillas E.", "AuthorID": "55078367000", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Tumor Suppression Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "16042164100": {"Name": "Fernandez-Marcos P.J.", "AuthorID": "16042164100", "AffiliationID": "60121744, 60006754, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Bioactive Products and Metabolic Syndrome Group, Madrid Institute of Advanced Studies (IMDEA) in Food, CEI UAM+CSIC"}, "7003578388": {"Name": "Pantoja C.", "AuthorID": "7003578388", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Tumor Suppression Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "37021635800": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz-Martin M.", "AuthorID": "37021635800", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Tumor Suppression Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "7201394101": {"Name": "Serrano M.", "AuthorID": "7201394101", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Tumor Suppression Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "57217727528": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez D.", "AuthorID": "57217727528", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Flow Cytometry Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "24279428700": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez G.", "AuthorID": "24279428700", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "6701394622": {"Name": "Campos-Olivas R.", "AuthorID": "6701394622", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "7005337778": {"Name": "Valverde A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005337778", "AffiliationID": "60102755, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabolicas Asociadas, ISCIII"}}}
