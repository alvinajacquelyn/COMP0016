Previous studies on structural-functional analysis in patients with AMD with reticular drusen (RDR) have focused on photopic sensitivity testing but have not specifically assessed scotopic function. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retinal function by scotopic and photopic microperimetry in patients with AMD and a well-demarcated area of RDR. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective case series in a referral center of 22 eyes from 18 patients (mean age, 74.7 years; range, 62-87 years). The study was conducted from June 1, 2014, to October 31, 2014. INTERVENTIONS: With the use of combined confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging, retinal areas with RDR (category 1) and no visible pathologic alterations (category 2) were identified in each eye. Scotopic and photopic microperimetry (MP-1S; Nidek Technologies) was performed using a grid with 56 stimulus points. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Comparison of mean threshold sensitivities for each category for scotopic and photopic microperimetry. RESULTS: In all eyes, areas of category 1 showed a relative and sharply demarcated reduction of scotopic threshold values compared with areas of category 2, but only less-pronounced differences were seen for photopic testing. Statistical analysis in the 18 eyes in which the 1.0-log unit neutral density filter was applied revealed a difference of scotopic threshold values in areas of category 1 (mean, 13.5 dB [95%CI, 12.1-15.0]) vs category 2 (mean, 18.3 dB; [95%CI, 17.4-19.3] (P \u2264.001). For photopic testing, the mean threshold values were 16.8 dB (95%CI, 15.5-18.2) in category 1 and 18.4 dB (95%CI, 17.1-19.6) in category 2 (P =.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that rod function is more severely affected than cone function in retinal areas with RDR. This differential structural-functional correlation underscores the functional relevance of RDR in patients with AMD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Color Vision", "Female", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Middle Aged", "Night Vision", "Ophthalmoscopy", "Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Drusen", "Sensory Thresholds", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Field Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931075195", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36164650000": {"Name": "Steinberg J.", "AuthorID": "36164650000", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "23979991600": {"Name": "Fleckenstein M.", "AuthorID": "23979991600", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "57201820304": {"Name": "Holz F.", "AuthorID": "57201820304", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "6507005629": {"Name": "Schmitz-Valckenberg S.", "AuthorID": "6507005629", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "35498159200": {"Name": "Fitzke F.", "AuthorID": "35498159200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7006170030": {"Name": "Fimmers R.", "AuthorID": "7006170030", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biostatistics, University of Bonn"}}}
