Patients and methods: A non-interventional study in six UK acute hospitals collected retrospective clinical and resource use data from medical records of 64 adults hospitalized for rCDI and 64 matched inpatient controls with a first episode only (f)CDI. Patients were observed from the index event (date rCDI/fCDI confirmed) for 28 days (or death, if sooner); UK-specific reference costs were applied. HRQoL was assessed prospectively in a separate cohort of 30 patients hospitalized with CDI, who completed the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire during their illness. Results: The median total management cost (post-index) was \u00a37539 and \u00a36294 for rCDI and fCDI, respectively (cost difference, P=0.075); median length of stay was 21 days and 15.5 days, respectively (P=0.269). The median cost difference between matched rCDI and fCDI cases was \u00a3689 (IQR=\u00a31873-\u00a33954). Subgroup analysis demonstrated the highest median costs (\u00a38542/patient) in severe rCDI cases. CDI management costs were driven primarily by hospital length of stay, which accounted for .85% of costs in both groups. Mean EQ-5D index values were 46% lower in CDI patients compared with UK population values (0.42 and 0.78, respectively); EQ visual analogue scale scores were 38% lower (47.82 and 77.3, respectively). Conclusions: CDI has considerable impact on patients and healthcare resources. This multicentre study provides a contemporaneous estimate of the real-world UK costs associated with rCDI management, which are substantial and comparable to fCDI costs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Clostridium difficile", "Clostridium Infections", "Cohort Studies", "Cost of Illness", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Health Resources", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Medical Records", "Quality of Life", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041621848", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55446626100": {"Name": "Wilcox M.H.", "AuthorID": "55446626100", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Leeds"}, "57194507347": {"Name": "Ahir H.", "AuthorID": "57194507347", "AffiliationID": "60022949", "AffiliationName": "Merck Sharp and Dohme Limited"}, "6604018602": {"Name": "Coia J.E.", "AuthorID": "6604018602", "AffiliationID": "60032803", "AffiliationName": "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"}, "6506919910": {"Name": "Dodgson A.", "AuthorID": "6506919910", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201536091": {"Name": "Llewelyn M.J.", "AuthorID": "57201536091", "AffiliationID": "60003456, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Sussex"}, "6701735093": {"Name": "Settle C.", "AuthorID": "6701735093", "AffiliationID": "60176727", "AffiliationName": "City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190685005": {"Name": "Mclain-Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57190685005", "AffiliationID": "60112101", "AffiliationName": "pH Associates"}, "57212878649": {"Name": "Marcella S.W.", "AuthorID": "57212878649", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Merck and Co., Inc."}}}
