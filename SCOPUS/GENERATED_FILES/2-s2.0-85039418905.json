It has been used extensively in photoacoustic imaging as well as general ultrasound field characterisation. Although it will clearly affect the ultrasound field measurements, the directional response of the sensor has not been widely studied. The objective of this work was to develop an analytical model to study how the various wave types propagating in the multilayer FP sensor affect the directionality. This is critical to optimise the design of the FP sensor, and to reduce sensor-related image artefacts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039418905", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57200088418": {"Name": "Ramasawmy D.", "AuthorID": "57200088418", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "44061273200": {"Name": "Guggenheim J.", "AuthorID": "44061273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
