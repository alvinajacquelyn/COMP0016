By varying the Nb thickness tNb and comparing to a Ni80Fe20/Pt reference sample, room temperature values of \u03b8SH and lsd for Nb are estimated to be approximately -0.001 and 30 nm, respectively. We also investigate the ISHE as a function of temperature T for different tNb. Above the superconducting transition temperature Tc of Nb, a clear tNb-dependent T evolution of the ISHE is observed whereas below Tc, the ISHE voltage drops rapidly and is below the sensitivity of our measurement setup at a lower T. This suggests the strong decay of the quasiparticle (QP) charge-imbalance relaxation length across Tc, as supported by an additional investigation of the ISHE in a different sample geometry along with model calculation. Our finding suggests careful consideration should be made when developing superconductor spin Hall devices that intend to utilize QP-mediated spin-to-charge interconversion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge imbalance", "Interconversions", "Measurement setup", "Model calculations", "Relaxation length", "Sample geometry", "Spin-diffusion length", "Temperature values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050730156", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35765351000": {"Name": "Jeon K.R.", "AuthorID": "35765351000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57196217336": {"Name": "Komori S.", "AuthorID": "57196217336", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "15046973600": {"Name": "Robinson J.W.A.", "AuthorID": "15046973600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "7005011019": {"Name": "Blamire M.G.", "AuthorID": "7005011019", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "6701868743": {"Name": "Ciccarelli C.", "AuthorID": "6701868743", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "24071155200": {"Name": "Kurebayashi H.", "AuthorID": "24071155200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of College London"}, "8411693000": {"Name": "Wunderlich J.", "AuthorID": "8411693000", "AffiliationID": "60016576, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, ASCR"}, "35418235300": {"Name": "Cohen L.F.", "AuthorID": "35418235300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}}}
