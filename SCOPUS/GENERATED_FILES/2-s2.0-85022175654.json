Career satisfaction was significantly higher in those who exhibited: i) satisfaction with working hours; ii) satisfaction with the level of control over their working day; iii) ability to manage unexpected home events; and iv) confidence in how readily they managed patient expectations. The work-life balance score was lower than the career satisfaction score but the median score was 75/100. Work-life balance scores were significantly affected by the same four factors, but additionally were higher in those who worked part-time.Conclusions Orthodontists in this study were highly satisfied with their career and the majority responded that they would choose orthodontics again. Work-life balance scores were lower than career satisfaction scores but still relatively high. It is important for the profession to consider ways of maintaining, or improving, career satisfaction and work-life balance; including maintaining flexibility of working hours and ensuring that all clinicians have ready access to appropriate training courses throughout their careers (for example, management of patient expectations).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Ireland", "Job Satisfaction", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Orthodontists", "Prospective Studies", "Societies, Dental", "Specialties, Dental", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Work-Life Balance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022175654", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57194787299": {"Name": "Al-Junaid S.M.", "AuthorID": "57194787299", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Honorary Specialty Registrar in Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Foundation Trust"}, "19634983000": {"Name": "Hodges S.J.", "AuthorID": "19634983000", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Consultant in Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Foundation Trust"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "118788311", "AffiliationName": "Honorary Redr. in Biostatistics"}, "7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Prof./Honorary Consultant in Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
