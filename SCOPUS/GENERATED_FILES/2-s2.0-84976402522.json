Design: Data-linkage study of the UK National Joint Registry (NJR) data and Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database. Linkage was performed in a deterministic fashion. HES episodes 90 days after the index procedure were analysed for PE. Mortality data were obtained pertaining to all the index procedures from the NJR for analysis. Participants: All primary and revision ankle replacement patients captured on the NJR between February 2008 and February 2013. Results: The 90-day mortality following TAR was 0.13% (95% CI 0.03 to 0.52) and 1-year mortality was 0.72% (95% CI 0.40 to 1.30); no deaths were as a result of PE. The incidence of PE within 90 days following primary TAR was 0.51% (95% CI 0.23 to 1.13). There was only one PE following revision surgery. Patients with an Royal College of Surgeons Charlson score greater than zero were at 13 times greater risk of PE ( p=0.003). Conclusions: There is low incidence of PE following TAR, but multiple comorbidities are a leading risk factor for its occurrence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Ankle Fractures", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Ankle", "Comorbidity", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Immobilization", "Incidence", "Information Storage and Retrieval", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Embolism", "Registries", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976402522", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"53985758500": {"Name": "Zaidi R.", "AuthorID": "53985758500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust"}, "33067771800": {"Name": "Goldberg A.", "AuthorID": "33067771800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7102533144": {"Name": "MacGregor A.", "AuthorID": "7102533144", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "55337832800": {"Name": "Cro S.", "AuthorID": "55337832800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Medical Research Council (MRC)"}}}
