In practice, image reconstruction in MPI is frequently carried out by standard Tikhonov regularization with nonnegativity constraint, which is then minimized by a Kaczmarz type method. In this work, we revisit two issues in the numerical reconstruction in MPI in the lens of inverse theory, i.e. the choice of fidelity and acceleration, and propose two algorithmic tricks, i.e. a whitening procedure to incorporate the noise statistics and accelerating Kaczmarz iteration via randomized SVD. The two tricks are straightforward to implement and easy to incorporate in existing reconstruction algorithms. Their significant potentials are illustrated by extensive numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnetic particle imaging", "randomized singular value decomposition", "reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Magnetic particle imaging", "Noise statistics", "Non-negativity constraints", "Nonlinear magnetization", "Numerical experiments", "Numerical reconstruction", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Tikhonov regularization", "Algorithms", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetics", "Magnetite Nanoparticles", "Molecular Imaging", "Noise", "Phantoms, Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068586464", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"53663695400": {"Name": "Kluth T.", "AuthorID": "53663695400", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Center for Industrial Mathematics, University of Bremen"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
