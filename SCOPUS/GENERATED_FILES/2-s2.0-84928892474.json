Early identification of poor responders could allow earlier provision of postoperative behavioural and/or intensive lifestyle interventions and enhance their maximal weight loss. Our aim was to investigate whether early postoperative weight loss predicts the maximal weight loss response after RYGBP and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Methods: We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1,456 adults who underwent either RYGBP (n = 918) or SG (n = 538) as a primary procedure in one of two European centres. Postoperative weight loss was expressed as weight loss velocity (WLV) and percentage weight loss. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association of early postoperative weight loss with maximal %WL, including adjustment for baseline variables. Results: There was marked variability in maximal %WL following both RYGBP (mean 32.9 %, range 4.1\u201360.9 %) and SG (mean 26.2 %, range 1.1\u201358.3 %). WLV 3\u20136 months postoperatively was more strongly associated with maximal %WL (r2 = 0.32 for RYGBP and r2 = 0.26 for SG, P < 0.001 for both) than either WLV 0\u20136 weeks or 6 weeks to 3 months postoperatively (r2 = 0.14 and 0.10 for RYGBP, respectively; r2 = 0.18 and 0.21 for SG, respectively; P < 0.001 for all). Multiple linear regression analysis, including baseline variables of age, sex, preoperative BMI, type 2 diabetes, ethnicity, and bariatric centre, revealed that 3\u20136 month WLV was an independent predictor of maximal %WL in both SG and RYGBP groups (standardised \u03b2-coefficients 0.51 and 0.52, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Conclusions: There is a marked variability in weight loss response following RYGBP and SG. Early postoperative weight loss can be used to identify patients whose predicted weight loss trajectories are suboptimal. Early targeting of poor responders with more intensive postoperative lifestyle and behavioural support could potentially enhance their weight loss response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["% weight loss", "Bariatric surgery", "BMI", "Obesity", "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass", "Sleeve gastrectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gastrectomy", "Gastric Bypass", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Morbid", "Postoperative Period", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928892474", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"55815739900": {"Name": "Manning S.", "AuthorID": "55815739900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "37102604700": {"Name": "Pucci A.", "AuthorID": "37102604700", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Obesity Center, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "25221288800": {"Name": "Elkalaawy M.", "AuthorID": "25221288800", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Surgery Department, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria"}, "35461137000": {"Name": "Finer N.", "AuthorID": "35461137000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Centre for Weight Loss, Metabolic and Endocrine Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "10142300200": {"Name": "Hashemi M.", "AuthorID": "10142300200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Centre for Weight Loss, Metabolic and Endocrine Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "55909647100": {"Name": "Jenkinson A.D.", "AuthorID": "55909647100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Centre for Weight Loss, Metabolic and Endocrine Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "42561116100": {"Name": "Adamo M.", "AuthorID": "42561116100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Centre for Weight Loss, Metabolic and Endocrine Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "37102752600": {"Name": "Querci G.", "AuthorID": "37102752600", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Obesity Center, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "56313123600": {"Name": "Magno S.", "AuthorID": "56313123600", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Obesity Center, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "55987216100": {"Name": "Tamberi A.", "AuthorID": "55987216100", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Obesity Center, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "7101742775": {"Name": "Santini F.", "AuthorID": "7101742775", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Obesity Center, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "55368384700": {"Name": "Carter N.C.", "AuthorID": "55368384700", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "6701749219": {"Name": "Fiennes A.G.", "AuthorID": "6701749219", "AffiliationID": "121493817", "AffiliationName": "Surrey Weight Loss Centre, St Anthony\u2019s Hospital"}, "7006817772": {"Name": "Anselmino M.", "AuthorID": "7006817772", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Bariatric Surgery Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}}}
