In this paper we underline that the NICE and SIGN guidelines recommend similar interventions, but that the NICE guideline has more rigorous methodology. Our analysis suggests that the authors of the editorial appear to have succumbed to bias themselves.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["England", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Scotland"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963623734", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7006779060": {"Name": "Kendall T.", "AuthorID": "7006779060", "AffiliationID": "60171178, 60026447", "AffiliationName": "National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, Royal College of Psychiatrists, Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004038377": {"Name": "Whittington C.J.", "AuthorID": "7004038377", "AffiliationID": "114502375", "AffiliationName": "Doctor Evidence"}, "16064103300": {"Name": "Kuipers E.", "AuthorID": "16064103300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55635993400": {"Name": "Birchwood M.J.", "AuthorID": "55635993400", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7402449340": {"Name": "Marshall M.", "AuthorID": "7402449340", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60170526", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust, School of Medicine, Manchester University"}, "7402258312": {"Name": "Morrison A.P.", "AuthorID": "7402258312", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60122796", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
