A sagittal T2-weighted sequence was used to characterize lesion severity. At the C2-3 level, a high-resolution T2-weighted sequence was used to assess cross-sectional areas of gray and white matter, including their subcompartments; a diffusion-weighted sequence was used to compute voxel-based diffusion indices. Regression models determined associations between lesion severity and tissue-specific neurodegeneration and associations between the latter with neurophysiologic and clinical outcome.ResultsNeurodegeneration was evident within the dorsal and ventral horns and white matter above the level of injury. Tract-specific neurodegeneration was associated with prolonged conduction of appropriate electrophysiologic recordings. Dorsal horn atrophy was associated with sensory outcome, while ventral horn atrophy was associated with motor outcome. White matter integrity of dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts was associated with daily-life independence.ConclusionOur results suggest that, next to anterograde and retrograde degeneration of white matter tracts, neuronal circuits within the spinal cord far above the level of injury undergo transsynaptic neurodegeneration, resulting in specific gray matter changes. Such improved understanding of tissue-specific cord pathology offers potential biomarkers with more efficient targeting and monitoring of neuroregenerative (i.e., white matter) and neuroprotective (i.e., gray matter) agents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Atrophy", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Hot Temperature", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physical Stimulation", "Pyramidal Tracts", "Retrospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index", "Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Spinal Cord Ventral Horn", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051190639", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7102103047": {"Name": "Huber E.", "AuthorID": "7102103047", "AffiliationID": "60000869", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center, Balgrist University Hospital"}, "57188986656": {"Name": "David G.", "AuthorID": "57188986656", "AffiliationID": "60000869", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center, Balgrist University Hospital"}, "14037413900": {"Name": "Freund P.", "AuthorID": "14037413900", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "7404597283": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "7404597283", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "25823875500": {"Name": "Mohammadi S.", "AuthorID": "25823875500", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
