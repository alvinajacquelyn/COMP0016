However, the extent, characteristics and role of MPS in transmission is poorly understood. We investigate these questions using data from Britain 's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3). Methods: We performed complex survey analyses of data from 6293 men aged 16-74 years resident in Britain who completed Natsal-3, a probability sample survey undertaken during 2010-2012, using computerassisted personal interviewing and computer-assisted self-interview. Results: 11.0% (95% CI10.1% to 11.9%) of all men reported ever paying for sex. Among MPS, 18.4% (95% CI 18.2% to 18.7%) of their lifetime sexual partners were paid. 3.6% (95% CI 3.1% to 4.2%) of men had paid for sex in the past 5 years. Partners of MPS constitute 14.7% of all reported partners and MPS report 15.6% of all reported STI diagnoses in the past 5 years. Paying for sex in the past 5 years was strongly associated with reporting larger numbers of sexual partners (adjusted OR, AOR for 5+ partners, past 5 years, 31.50, 95% CI 18.69 to 53.09). After adjusting for partner numbers, paying for sex remained strongly associated with reporting new foreign partners outside the UK (AOR 7.96; 95% CI 4.97 to 12.73) and STI diagnosis/es (AOR 2.34; 95% CI 1.44 to 3.81), all in the past 5 years. Among men ever paying for sex, 62.6% (95% CI 58.3% to 66.8%) reported paying for sex outside the UK, most often in Europe and Asia. Conclusions: MPS in Britain remain at greater risk of STI acquisition and onward transmission than men who do not. They report high numbers of partners, but the minority are paid partners. They are an important core group in STI transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924010690", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57199313412": {"Name": "Jones K.G.", "AuthorID": "57199313412", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55617668400": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "55617668400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "24069384200": {"Name": "Tanton C.", "AuthorID": "24069384200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "6602875368": {"Name": "Erens B.", "AuthorID": "6602875368", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen Social Research"}, "47661542700": {"Name": "Prah P.", "AuthorID": "47661542700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "37116738400": {"Name": "Datta J.", "AuthorID": "37116738400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7202163725": {"Name": "Mitchell K.R.", "AuthorID": "7202163725", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
