Off-target pharmacology of arimoclomol (2) was evaluated against a representative set of drug targets and showed modest binding to a few kinases. Pharmacokinetic data was generated in vivo in mouse and showed a low brain:plasma ratio. These studies will be helpful towards a better understanding of the PK-PD relationship of 2 in disease models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chiral integrity", "Chiral synthesis", "Disease models", "Drug targets", "Enantiopure", "Enantiospecific synthesis", "Pharmacokinetic data", "Regio-selective", "Animals", "Epoxy Compounds", "Heat-Shock Proteins", "Hydroxylamines", "Male", "Mice", "Molecular Structure", "Stereoisomerism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037028705", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57198770573": {"Name": "Atkinson B.", "AuthorID": "57198770573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, Cruciform Building, University College London"}, "18134644900": {"Name": "Woodward H.", "AuthorID": "18134644900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, Cruciform Building, University College London"}, "57194386685": {"Name": "Sipthorp J.", "AuthorID": "57194386685", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, Cruciform Building, University College London"}, "7005747441": {"Name": "Fish P.", "AuthorID": "7005747441", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, Cruciform Building, University College London"}}}
