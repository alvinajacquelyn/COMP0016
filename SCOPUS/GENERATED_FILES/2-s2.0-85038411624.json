IAPT offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to individuals experiencing mental health problems, although its effectiveness for people with ID, when delivered within IAPT, is unclear. Method: Ten high-intensity therapists took part in semi-structured interviews, analysed using thematic analysis, regarding their experiences of delivering CBT to people with ID in IAPT. Results: The rigidity of the IAPT model appears to offer a poor fit with the needs of people with ID. Therapists appeared uncertain about how to modify CBT and highlighted training and service development needs. Conclusions: Findings suggest barriers to accessing IAPT largely remain unaddressed where people with ID are concerned. Services may need to reconsider what constitutes appropriate reasonable adjustments to ensure equitable access.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CBT", "high-intensity therapists", "IAPT", "intellectual disabilities", "mental health", "therapist confidence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive Therapy", "England", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Mental Health Services", "Psychotherapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038411624", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"55246014700": {"Name": "Marwood H.", "AuthorID": "55246014700", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Charlie Waller Institute, School of Psychology, University of Reading"}, "36674720300": {"Name": "Chinn D.", "AuthorID": "36674720300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery and the Centre for Language, Discourse and Communication, Kings College London"}, "35614843500": {"Name": "Gannon K.", "AuthorID": "35614843500", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Educational & Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
