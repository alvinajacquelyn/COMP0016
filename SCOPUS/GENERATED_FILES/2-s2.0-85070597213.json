The catalysts were tested in the dry preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO-PrOx) while their phase stability was monitored using four complementary in situ techniques, viz., magnet-based characterization, PXRD, and combined XAS/DRIFTS, as well as quasi in situ XPS, respectively. The catalyst with weak NPSI achieved higher CO2 yields and selectivities at temperatures below 225 \u00b0C compared to the sample with strong NPSI. However, relatively high degrees of reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co were reached between 250 and 350 \u00b0C for the same catalyst. The presence of metallic Co led to the undesired formation of CH4, reaching a yield of over 90% above 300 \u00b0C. The catalyst with strong NPSI formed very low amounts of metallic Co (less than 1%) and CH4 (yield of up to 20%) even at 350 \u00b0C. When the temperature was decreased from 350 to 50 \u00b0C under the reaction gas, both catalysts were slightly reoxidized and gradually regained their CO oxidation activity, while the formation of CH4 diminished. The present study shows a strong relationship between catalyst performance (i.e., activity and selectivity) and phase stability, both of which are affected by the strength of the NPSI. When using a metal oxide as the active CO-PrOx catalyst, it is important for it to have significant reduction resistance to avoid the formation of undesired products, e.g., CH4. However, the metal oxide should also be reducible (especially on the surface) to allow for a complete conversion of CO to CO2 via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catalyst performance", "CO-PrOx", "Co3O4/Al2O3", "in situ characterization", "nanoparticle-support interactions", "phase stability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst performance", "CO-PROX", "Co3O4/Al2O3", "In-situ characterization", "Support interaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070597213", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57204490576": {"Name": "Nyathi T.M.", "AuthorID": "57204490576", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Institute and C-change (DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Catalysis), Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Cape Town"}, "56521057100": {"Name": "Fischer N.", "AuthorID": "56521057100", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Institute and C-change (DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Catalysis), Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Cape Town"}, "7102514932": {"Name": "Claeys M.", "AuthorID": "7102514932", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Institute and C-change (DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Catalysis), Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Cape Town"}, "57197469976": {"Name": "York A.P.E.", "AuthorID": "57197469976", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "55512389100": {"Name": "Morgan D.J.", "AuthorID": "55512389100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University, Main Building, Park Place, CF10 3AT"}, "35502091400": {"Name": "Hutchings G.J.", "AuthorID": "35502091400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University, Main Building, Park Place, CF10 3AT"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street, WC1H 0AJ"}, "8306766600": {"Name": "Gibson E.K.", "AuthorID": "8306766600", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, OX11 0FA"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Diamond Light Source Ltd., OX11 0DE"}}}
