Pain and somatic sensation are undeniable markers of normal bodily awareness. However, the mechanism by which they are integrated into a coherent sense of the bodily self remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-level multisensory manipulation on subjective experiences of pain, touch, and body-ownership. Methods: We administered visuo-tactile stimulation based on the rubber hand illusion. In a longitudinal study, we compared the strength of the illusion in a male with SCI, who initially had lost somatosensation in all his fingers, but a few months later reported signs of tactile allodynia restricted to the left C6-dermatome. Results: After the restoration of some somatosensation, even if it were painful, synchronous but not asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation induced body illusion. Previously painful stimuli were temporarily perceived as less painful, and the patient further regained tactile sensations in adjacent numb areas. Conclusions: The sensations of touch and pain are mutually influenced and inextricably linked to a coherent representation of one's own body. Multisensory manipulations affecting the perception and representation of the body might thus offer a powerful opportunity to mitigate nociceptive and somatic abnormalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allodynia", "analgesia", "Bodily illusions", "pain", "rehabilitation", "somatosensory perception", "spinal cord injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Image", "Humans", "Hyperalgesia", "Illusions", "Male", "Pain Perception", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Touch Perception", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983268475", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"25422528000": {"Name": "Pazzaglia M.", "AuthorID": "25422528000", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation"}, "6701533068": {"Name": "Scivoletto G.", "AuthorID": "6701533068", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation"}, "7103134641": {"Name": "Molinari M.", "AuthorID": "7103134641", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "23009324400": {"Name": "Lenggenhager B.", "AuthorID": "23009324400", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology Unit, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich"}}}
