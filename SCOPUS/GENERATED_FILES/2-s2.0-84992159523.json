These inhaled particulates affect more than half of the world\u2019s population, causing respiratory problems such as infection and inflammatory lung disease. We examined whether the presence of black carbon in alveolar macrophages was associated with alterations in the lung microbiome in a Malawi population. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 44 healthy adults were sequenced using 16S rDNA amplification to assess microbial diversity, richness and relative taxa abundance. Individuals were classified as high or low particulate exposure as determined by questionnaire and the percentage of black carbon within their alveolar macrophages. Results: Subjects in the low and high particulate groups did not differ in terms of source of fuels used for cooking or lighting. There was no difference in alpha or beta diversity by particulate group. Neisseria and Streptococcus were significantly more abundant in samples from high particulate exposed individuals, and Tropheryma was found less abundant. Petrobacter abundance was higher in people using biomass fuel for household cooking and lighting, compared with exclusive use of electricity. Conclusions: Healthy adults in Malawi exposed to higher levels of particulates have higher abundances of potentially pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus, Neisseria) within their lung microbiome. Domestic biomass fuel use was associated with an uncommon environmental bacterium (Petrobacter) associated with oil-rich niches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alveolar macrophage", "Household air pollution", "Petrobacter", "Respiratory microbiome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Air Pollution, Indoor", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Carbon", "Cooking", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Fossil Fuels", "Housing", "Humans", "Inhalation Exposure", "Lung", "Macrophages, Alveolar", "Malawi", "Male", "Microbiota", "Particulate Matter", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992159523", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"26649010600": {"Name": "Rylance J.", "AuthorID": "26649010600", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "7401829209": {"Name": "Gordon S.B.", "AuthorID": "7401829209", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "57213807842": {"Name": "Day R.B.", "AuthorID": "57213807842", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Indiana University"}, "7003312913": {"Name": "Twigg H.L.", "AuthorID": "7003312913", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Indiana University"}, "6504735354": {"Name": "Kankwatira A.", "AuthorID": "6504735354", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "57220950896": {"Name": "Nelson D.E.", "AuthorID": "57220950896", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "36553472100": {"Name": "Toh E.", "AuthorID": "36553472100", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "56949308900": {"Name": "Lin H.", "AuthorID": "56949308900", "AffiliationID": "60003545", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago"}, "56949404900": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "56949404900", "AffiliationID": "60003545", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago"}, "8148229300": {"Name": "Dong Q.", "AuthorID": "8148229300", "AffiliationID": "60003545", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago"}, "6701578232": {"Name": "Sodergren E.", "AuthorID": "6701578232", "AffiliationID": "60010887", "AffiliationName": "Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine"}, "7005387907": {"Name": "Weinstock G.M.", "AuthorID": "7005387907", "AffiliationID": "60010887", "AffiliationName": "Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine"}}}
