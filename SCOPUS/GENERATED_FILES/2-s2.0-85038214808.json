The results show that osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cell death is induced through the addition of gallium oxide. Relative to the gallium-free control glass (0% Ga) glasses containing 1, 2, and 3% Ga decreased Saos-2 cell viability in a dose dependent manner. After 72 h in media preconditioned with 3% Ga Saos-2 cell viability was reduced by over 50%. Corresponding studies undertaken on primary normal human osteoblast cells (NHOst) demonstrated no adverse effects to the gallium containing glasses. Hydroxyapatite formation was observed for all glasses when exposed to simulated body fluid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apatite", "bioactive glass", "bone", "cancer", "gallium", "sarcoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone formation", "cancer", "Dose-dependent manner", "Hydroxyapatite formations", "Normal human osteoblasts", "Osteosarcoma cells", "sarcoma", "Simulated body fluids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038214808", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56009162800": {"Name": "Rana K.S.", "AuthorID": "56009162800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Materials Research, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, University of Aston"}, "57199645286": {"Name": "Souza L.P.D.", "AuthorID": "57199645286", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Materials Research, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, University of Aston"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.A.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Materials Research, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, University of Aston"}, "57199645342": {"Name": "Raja F.N.S.", "AuthorID": "57199645342", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Materials Research, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, University of Aston"}, "57199645425": {"Name": "Morrell A.P.", "AuthorID": "57199645425", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Materials Research, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, University of Aston"}, "7501382403": {"Name": "Martin R.A.", "AuthorID": "7501382403", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Materials Research, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, University of Aston"}}}
