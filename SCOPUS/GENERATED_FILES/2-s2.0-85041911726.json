Though some biosynthetic methods allow global residue-replacement, post-translational fluorine incorporation would constitute a fast and efficient alternative. Here, we reveal a mild method for direct protein radical trifluoromethylation at native residues as a strategy for symmetric-multifluorine incorporation on mg scales with high recoveries. High selectivity toward tryptophan residues enhanced the utility of this direct trifluoromethylation technique allowing ready study of fluorinated protein constructs using 19F-NMR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["19F NMR", "High selectivity", "Trifluoromethylation", "Tryptophan residues", "Animals", "Free Radicals", "Hemeproteins", "Horses", "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated", "Molecular Structure", "Myoglobin", "Tryptophan"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041911726", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57200614383": {"Name": "Imio\u0142ek M.", "AuthorID": "57200614383", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "57189592844": {"Name": "Karunanithy G.", "AuthorID": "57189592844", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "39861909300": {"Name": "Ng W.", "AuthorID": "39861909300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "12753648200": {"Name": "Baldwin A.", "AuthorID": "12753648200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7003461253": {"Name": "Gouverneur V.", "AuthorID": "7003461253", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7403923350": {"Name": "Davis B.", "AuthorID": "7403923350", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
