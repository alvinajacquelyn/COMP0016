The present research examined whether food's ethicality - a cue typically unrelated to quality - can also influence taste. We hypothesised that moral satisfaction with the consumption of ethical food would positively influence taste expectations, which in turn will enhance the actual taste experience. This enhanced taste experience was further hypothesised to act as a possible reward mechanism reinforcing the purchase of ethical food. The resulting ethical food \u2192 moral satisfaction \u2192 enhanced taste expectations and experience \u2192 stronger intentions to buy/willingness to pay model was validated across four studies: one large scale international survey (Study 1) and three experimental studies involving actual food consumption of different type of ethical origin - organic (Study 2), fair trade (Study 3a) and locally produced (Study 3b). Furthermore, endorsement of values relevant to the food's ethical origin moderated the effect of food's origin on moral satisfaction, suggesting that the model is primarily supported for people who endorse these values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buying intentions", "Ethics", "Fair trade", "Morality", "Organic food", "Taste"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Cues", "Diet", "European Union", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Food Preferences", "Food Supply", "Food, Organic", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Psychological", "Morals", "Personal Satisfaction", "Self Report", "Sensation", "Taste", "Taste Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928404752", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"35955578400": {"Name": "Bratanova B.", "AuthorID": "35955578400", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "Dundee Business School, Abertay University"}, "7006311271": {"Name": "Klein O.", "AuthorID": "7006311271", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Social and Intercultural Psychology, Universit\u00e9 Libr\u00e9 de Bruxelles"}, "35590750600": {"Name": "Vauclair C.M.", "AuthorID": "35590750600", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Cis-IUL"}, "24448018000": {"Name": "Kervyn N.", "AuthorID": "24448018000", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Louvain School of Management, Catholic University of Louvain"}, "35746852100": {"Name": "Schumann S.", "AuthorID": "35746852100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, University of Oxford"}, "35399188800": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "35399188800", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ethical Leadership, Ormond College, University of Melbourne"}}}
