A corollary is that the Gromov-Witten invariants (without descendants) of symplectic 4-manifolds can always be computed as a signed and weighted count of honest J-holomorphic curves for generic tame J: in particular, each such invariant is an integer divided by a weighting factor that depends only on the divisibility of the corresponding homology class. The transversality proof is based on an analytic perturbation technique, originally due to Taubes.\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003845796", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57205045873": {"Name": "Gerig C.", "AuthorID": "57205045873", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Department, University of California"}, "35308190800": {"Name": "Wendl C.", "AuthorID": "35308190800", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}}}
