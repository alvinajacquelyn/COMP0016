All rights reserved.Photoacoustic imaging allows absorption-based high-resolution spectroscopic in vivo imaging at a depth beyond that of optical microscopy. Until recently, photoacoustic imaging has largely been restricted to visualizing the vasculature through endogenous haemoglobin contrast, with most non-vascularized tissues remaining invisible unless exogenous contrast agents are administered. Genetically encodable photoacoustic contrast is attractive as it allows selective labelling of cells, permitting studies of, for example, specific genetic expression, cell growth or more complex biological behaviours in vivo. In this study we report a novel photoacoustic imaging scanner and a tyrosinase-based reporter system that causes human cell lines to synthesize the absorbing pigment eumelanin, thus providing strong photoacoustic contrast. Detailed three-dimensional images of xenografts formed of tyrosinase-expressing cells implanted in mice are obtained in vivo to depths approaching 10 mm with a spatial resolution below 100 \u03bcm. This scheme is a powerful tool for studying cellular and genetic processes in deep mammalian tissues.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Genetic expressions", "Genetic reporters", "Human cell lines", "Mammalian tissues", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Spatial resolution", "Three dimensional images", "Vascularized tissues"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926289010", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36740260600": {"Name": "Jathoul A.", "AuthorID": "36740260600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6603720207": {"Name": "Pizzey A.", "AuthorID": "6603720207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55759124700": {"Name": "Philip B.", "AuthorID": "55759124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57211009223": {"Name": "Pule M.", "AuthorID": "57211009223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55368950600": {"Name": "Johnson P.", "AuthorID": "55368950600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "7006757998": {"Name": "Pedley R.", "AuthorID": "7006757998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7005864579": {"Name": "Laufer J.", "AuthorID": "7005864579", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Optik und Atomare Physik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "6507089413": {"Name": "Ogunlade O.", "AuthorID": "6507089413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "7003959647": {"Name": "Marafioti T.", "AuthorID": "7003959647", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London"}}}
