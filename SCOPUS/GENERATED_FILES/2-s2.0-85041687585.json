Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, many elderlies suffer from cardiovascular problems that are much more frequent in an older, more fragile organism. In the long term, age-related cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) contribute to the decline of quality of life and ability to perform normal activities of daily living. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in both physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we will focus on the role of miRNAs in aging and age-related CVDs as heart failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. miRNAs are key regulators of complex biological mechanisms, representing an exciting potential therapeutic target in CVDs. Moreover, one major challenge in geriatric medicine is to find reliable biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of the response to specific drugs. miRNAs represent a very promising tool due to their stability in the circulation and unique signature in CVDs. However, further studies are needed to investigate their translational potential in the real clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Atherosclerosis", "Atrial fibrillation", "Cardiovascular diseases", "Diabetes", "Heart failure", "Hypertension", "MicroRNA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041687585", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6505895452": {"Name": "De Lucia C.", "AuthorID": "6505895452", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "55391030100": {"Name": "Komici K.", "AuthorID": "55391030100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "56196018200": {"Name": "Femminella G.D.", "AuthorID": "56196018200", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57194680251": {"Name": "Bencivenga L.", "AuthorID": "57194680251", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "56491188600": {"Name": "Cannavo A.", "AuthorID": "56491188600", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "35414915500": {"Name": "Ferrara N.", "AuthorID": "35414915500", "AffiliationID": "60018722", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute of Telese Terme, Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, IRCCS"}, "16031800600": {"Name": "Rengo G.", "AuthorID": "16031800600", "AffiliationID": "60018722", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute of Telese Terme, Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, IRCCS"}, "24826262600": {"Name": "Koch W.J.", "AuthorID": "24826262600", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "57190880650": {"Name": "Borghetti G.", "AuthorID": "57190880650", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "57202906816": {"Name": "Houser S.R.", "AuthorID": "57202906816", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "9535074800": {"Name": "Corbi G.", "AuthorID": "9535074800", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}}}
