Children and teachers who engaged in summer expeditions, for example, found self-fulfillment not only by opposing the regime or escaping into alternative lifestyles, but also by pursuing the socialist and national values the regime promoted and by activating forms of youth agency that were built into the socialist pedagogy of citizenship, which encouraged activism, voluntarism, and leadership in youth. To investigate young people's engagement with the socialist state, this article proposes a performative approach that has the potential to not only contribute to studies of late socialism, but also invigorate studies of nationalism and histories of childhood and youth under authoritarian regimes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065261092", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57213487395": {"Name": "Georgescu D.", "AuthorID": "57213487395", "AffiliationID": "60009550", "AffiliationName": "History and Environmental Studies, Northern Illinois University"}}}
