We investigated the efficacy of NRTI backbones (tenofovir or abacavir with a cytosine analogue) in low- and middle-income countries where there is significant prior exposure to antiretrovirals and drug resistance to NRTIs. Methods Within the treatment-as-prevention study in South Africa, we selected participants with available next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for the HIV-1 pol gene at trial entry; they were either ART initiators (n = 1193) or already established on ART (n = 94). NGS of the HIV-1 pol gene was carried out using MiSeq technology; reverse transcriptase drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were detected at 5% (DRM 5%) and 20% (DRM 20%) for all 1287 participants. Genotypic susceptibility was assessed using the Stanford HIVDB resistance interpretation algorithm. Results NRTI DRM 20% and DRM 5% were detected among 5/1193 (0.4%) and 9/1193 (0.8%) of ART initiators, respectively. There was tenofovir exposure in 73/94 (77.7%) of those established on ART, with full susceptibility to abacavir in 57/94 (60.6%) and 56/94 (59.6%) for DRM 20% and DRM 5%, respectively, while 67/94 (71.3%) and 64/94 (68.1%) were fully susceptible to tenofovir, respectively. The differences between tenofovir and abacavir were not statistically significant at the 20% or 5% variant level (P = 0.16 and 0.29, respectively). NGS detection of variants at the 5% level increased detection of K65R in both naive and treated groups. One of 607 integrase sequences carried a DRM 20% (Q148R). Conclusions Dolutegravir with a cytosine analogue plus tenofovir or abacavir appears to have similar efficacy in South Africans naive to ART. NGS should be considered in HIV drug resistance surveillance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Cytosine", "Dideoxynucleosides", "Drug Combinations", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Female", "Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring", "HIV Infections", "HIV Integrase Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "South Africa", "Tenofovir", "Viral Load", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060183662", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"8390710000": {"Name": "Derache A.", "AuthorID": "8390710000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "25641410300": {"Name": "Iwuji C.C.", "AuthorID": "25641410300", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Infection, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "55540068500": {"Name": "Danaviah S.", "AuthorID": "55540068500", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56848412000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56848412000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56770160800": {"Name": "Giandhari J.", "AuthorID": "56770160800", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "8897715800": {"Name": "De Oliveira T.", "AuthorID": "8897715800", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "55406676800": {"Name": "Marcelin A.G.", "AuthorID": "55406676800", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015622, 60139056", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epid\u00e9miologie et de Sant\u00e9 Publique (IPLESP), H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "57203677911": {"Name": "Calvez V.", "AuthorID": "57203677911", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015622, 60139056", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epid\u00e9miologie et de Sant\u00e9 Publique (IPLESP), H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "7101905261": {"Name": "Dabis F.", "AuthorID": "7101905261", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, ISPED, Centre INSERM 1219"}}}
