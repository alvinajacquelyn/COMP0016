Published by Oxford University Press.This article examines the issue of the appropriate scope of review of economic evidence enshrined in the discretionary assessments of utility regulators in the US and the UK. It advances a balance of institutional competencies approach to the question of the degree of deference owed to the regulatory agency's economic assessments. In doing so, it revisits the doctrinal positions advanced in the US and the UK for the substantive review of administrative discretion, so as to become attuned to the challenges posed by economic evidence. Drawing on insights from political science and economics, the suggested approach illuminates the institutional disadvantages of the courts that may warrant a high degree of deference. At the same time, however, it remains sensitive to the polycentric elements of regulatory disputes as well as to a number of institutional realities that may attenuate the weight of such comparative institutional disadvantages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjudication", "Administrative law", "Comparative law", "Economic regulation", "Evidence", "Judicial review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995947061", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57168891700": {"Name": "Mantzari D.", "AuthorID": "57168891700", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}}}
