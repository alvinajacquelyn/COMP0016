The present study examined whether the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII; a measure of the inflammatory potential of individuals\u2019 diets) is associated with recurrent depressive symptoms (DepS) (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score > 16 or taking antidepressants both at baseline and follow-up) assessed over 5 years in middle-aged men (n = 3,178) and women (n = 1,068) from the Whitehall II Study. For each increment of 1 SD of DII score, odds of recurrent DepS increased by 66% (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.30, 2.12]) in women, whereas no significant association between DII and recurrent DepS was observed in men (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12; 95% CI = [0.92, 1.36]). This association was little attenuated after adjustment for confounders and after taking into account levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. In conclusion, there is an association between proinflammatory diet and recurrent DepS in women that seems to not be driven by circulating inflammatory markers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort study", "depression", "dietary inflammatory index", "epidemiology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009211890", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"15070433300": {"Name": "Akbaraly T.N.", "AuthorID": "15070433300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57189716504": {"Name": "Kerleau C.", "AuthorID": "57189716504", "AffiliationID": "60027946", "AffiliationName": "EPHE"}, "57192932713": {"Name": "Chevallier N.", "AuthorID": "57192932713", "AffiliationID": "60027946", "AffiliationName": "EPHE"}, "57192926792": {"Name": "Ndiaye L.", "AuthorID": "57192926792", "AffiliationID": "60027946", "AffiliationName": "EPHE"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "36668094100": {"Name": "Wyart M.", "AuthorID": "36668094100", "AffiliationID": "60000292", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nimes"}, "55177729700": {"Name": "Shivappa N.", "AuthorID": "55177729700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Connecting Health Innovations"}, "7201723342": {"Name": "H\u00e9bert J.R.", "AuthorID": "7201723342", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Connecting Health Innovations"}}}
