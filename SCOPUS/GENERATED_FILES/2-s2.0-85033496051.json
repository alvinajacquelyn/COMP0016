Applications to active photonic devices, such as nonlinear optical gratings, are discussed as well.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D materials", "grapheme", "nonlinear optical effect", "optical nonlinearity enhancement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active photonic devices", "grapheme", "Non-linear optical", "Nonlinear optical effects", "Optical nonlinearity", "Optical nonlinearity enhancements", "Orders of magnitude", "Second and third harmonics"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033496051", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55487309400": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
