It is not clear whether hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) in this context share the same characteristics as conventional HCA. The aim of this study was to carry out a retrospective multicenter survey of hepatocellular nodules associated with hepatic vascular disorders. Methods Forty-five cases were reviewed, including 32 Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Benign nodules were subtyped using the HCA immunohistochemical panel. Results Nodules with a HCA morphology were observed in 11 cases. Six originated in BCS: two were liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) negative (one with malignant transformation); two expressed glutamine synthetase (GS) and nuclear b-catenin, two expressed C reactive protein (CRP). Among three cases with portal vein agenesis, one nodule was LFABP negative, two expressed GS and nuclear b-catenin, both with malignant transformation. In a Fallot tetralogy case, there were multiple LFABP negative nodules with borderline features and in a hepatoportal sclerosis case, the nodule looked like an inflammatory HCA. Two additional cases had nodules expressing CRP, without typical characteristics of inflammatory HCA. Conclusion HCA of different immunohistochemical phenotype can develop in hepatic vascular disorders; they may have a different behavior compared to conventional HCA and be more at risk of malignant transformation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoma, Liver Cell", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Budd-Chiari Syndrome", "C-Reactive Protein", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins", "Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Liver Neoplasms", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945473962", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"7005920974": {"Name": "Sempoux C.", "AuthorID": "7005920974", "AffiliationID": "60015866, 60023561", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Institut Universitaire de Pathologie (IUP)"}, "7005731939": {"Name": "Paradis V.", "AuthorID": "7005731939", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60123796, 60005915, 60123678", "AffiliationName": "Inserm UMR 1149, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Department of Pathology, Beaujon Hospital"}, "7801544631": {"Name": "Komuta M.", "AuthorID": "7801544631", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "DAnatomie Pathologique, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc"}, "55628576990": {"Name": "Wee A.", "AuthorID": "55628576990", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60031325, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Hospital"}, "35111020000": {"Name": "Calderaro J.", "AuthorID": "35111020000", "AffiliationID": "60106700, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U955, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale"}, "7006941090": {"Name": "Balabaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006941090", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm, UMR 1053, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux"}, "35398021800": {"Name": "Bioulac-Sage P.", "AuthorID": "35398021800", "AffiliationID": "60003362, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Pellegrin Hospital, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bordeaux"}, "55357692500": {"Name": "Quaglia A.", "AuthorID": "55357692500", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}}}
