All rights reserved.Oxidatively generated \u03b2-nitroso-o-quinone methides undergo an o- and/or peri-intramolecular cyclization to arene-fused 1,2-oxazoles, 1,2-oxazines or indoles. The reaction, found to be an innate process, has been scrutinized by DFT/B3LYP and MP2 calculations. Due to its rapidity, the process has been termed a 'reclusive' one. Competing o-(1,5)- and peri-(1,6)- or (1,5)-cyclizations advance via successive transition states. Activation barriers are drastically lowered in AcOH, probably through H hopping or tunnelling whereas they are barely reduced in other solvents. Aromaticity indices, such as HOMA, IA and ABO, have been used to assess the stability of the end-heterocycles and the preponderance of any one of them. Thus, the preferred cyclization mode, that is, the prevalence or exclusive formation of one of the heterocycles, appears to be oxidant-directed rather than determined by the quinone methide geometry. The question of the peri-cyclization, being a primary or a secondary process, has been tackled.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DFT and MP2 calculations", "Innate reclusive reaction", "Intramolecular o- and peri-cyclization", "\u03b2-Nitroso-o-quinone methides"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919797518", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"6602362174": {"Name": "Tzeli D.", "AuthorID": "6602362174", "AffiliationID": "60029067, 60031687", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical and Physical Chemistry Institute, National Hellenic Research Foundation"}, "6701864276": {"Name": "Petsalakis I.", "AuthorID": "6701864276", "AffiliationID": "60029067, 60031687", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical and Physical Chemistry Institute, National Hellenic Research Foundation"}, "6603479339": {"Name": "Tsoungas P.", "AuthorID": "6603479339", "AffiliationID": "60010754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Hellenic Pasteur Institute"}, "56181815800": {"Name": "Kozielewicz P.", "AuthorID": "56181815800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
