Methods: A cross-sectional study (MOBILITY) was conducted among normal individuals aged 20-69 years. Recruitment was stratified by gender, age (10-year categories) and height (10 cm categories). Eleven spinal mobility measures were assessed. Age specific RIs and percentiles were derived for each measure. Results: 393 volunteers were included. All spinal mobility measures decreased with increasing age. Therefore, age specific RIs were developed. The 95% RIs (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles), as well as the 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles for each spinal mobility measure and different ages are presented. Mobility percentile curves were also plotted for each of the measures. For instance, the 95% RI for lateral spinal flexion was 16.2-28.0 cm for a 25-year-old subject, 13.2-25.0 cm for a 45-year-old subject and 10.1-21.9 cm for a 65-year-old subject. After adjustment for age, there was no need for gender specific RIs, while RIs of some measures are height-adjusted. Conclusions: Age specific RIs and percentiles were derived for each of the spinal mobility measures for normal individuals. These may guide clinicians when assessing the mobility of patients with axial spondyloarthritis. The RIs may serve as cut-off levels for 'normal' versus 'abnormal', whereas the mobility percentile curves may be used to assess the level of mobility of patients with axial spondyloarthritis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Body Height", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Reference Values", "Sex Factors", "Spine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934888214", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36551491700": {"Name": "Ramiro S.", "AuthorID": "36551491700", "AffiliationID": "60025571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Hospital Garcia de Orta"}, "7006658098": {"Name": "Landew\u00e9 R.", "AuthorID": "7006658098", "AffiliationID": "60002051", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Atrium Medical Center"}, "6602075277": {"Name": "Van Tubergen A.", "AuthorID": "6602075277", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), University of Maastricht"}, "55427193200": {"Name": "Stolwijk C.", "AuthorID": "55427193200", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), University of Maastricht"}, "35380236300": {"Name": "Van Der Heijde D.", "AuthorID": "35380236300", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "55561839500": {"Name": "Royston P.", "AuthorID": "55561839500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7006083023": {"Name": "Kvien T.", "AuthorID": "7006083023", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
