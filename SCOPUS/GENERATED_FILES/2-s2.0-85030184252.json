All rights reserved.The actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell mechanics and has increasingly been implicated in the regulation of cell signalling. In B cells, the actin cytoskeleton is extensively coupled to B cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathways, and defects of the actin cytoskeleton can either promote or suppress B cell activation. Recent insights from studies using single-cell imaging and biophysical techniques suggest that actin orchestrates BCR signalling at the plasma membrane through effects on protein diffusion and that it regulates antigen discrimination through the biomechanics of immune synapses. These mechanical functions also have a role in the adaptation of B cell subsets to specialized tasks during antibody responses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cytoskeleton", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030184252", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"6603645423": {"Name": "Tolar P.", "AuthorID": "6603645423", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}}}
