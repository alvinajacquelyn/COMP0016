All rights reserved.Lingual arches are fixed space maintainers utilised for the preservation of leeway space in cases of mild mandibular crowding. They are normally bonded using glass-ionomer cement applied to the internal surface of molar bands. As with any fixed appliance/retainer, if molar bands are not sufficiently monitored they have the potential to pose a significant threat to an individual's dental health. Unconventionally, in our example a lingual arch was used as a long-term fixed retainer with harmful consequence to one of the banded first permanent molars. A general understanding of molar bands and fixed retainers is important for patients' general dental health by the prevention of discrete caries progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Humans", "Iatrogenic Disease", "Male", "Malocclusion, Angle Class II", "Orthodontic Appliance Design", "Orthodontic Retainers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009754983", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57192982703": {"Name": "Hemmings N.", "AuthorID": "57192982703", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "7004255619": {"Name": "Noar J.H.", "AuthorID": "7004255619", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital"}}}
