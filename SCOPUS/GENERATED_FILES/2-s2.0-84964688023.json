The use of 3D X-ray imaging techniques, which are continuously evolving, provides a non-invasive platform to study the relationship between electrode microstructure and performance at various time and length scales. In addition to characterizing a weakly (X-ray) absorbing graphite electrode at multiple length scales, we implement an approach for obtaining improved nano-scale image contrast on a laboratory X-ray microscope by combining information obtained from both absorption\u2013contrast and Zernike phase-contrast X-ray images.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graphite electrode", "Image contrast", "Phase-contrast", "X-rays"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contrast Enhancement", "Electrochemical performance", "Electrode microstructures", "Image contrasts", "Li-ion battery electrodes", "Microstructural morphology", "Phase contrasts", "Zernike phase contrast"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964688023", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55976146800": {"Name": "Taiwo O.", "AuthorID": "55976146800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24775669300": {"Name": "Gelb J.", "AuthorID": "24775669300", "AffiliationID": "114013155", "AffiliationName": "Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy Inc."}, "24076036500": {"Name": "Holzner C.", "AuthorID": "24076036500", "AffiliationID": "114013155", "AffiliationName": "Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy Inc."}}}
