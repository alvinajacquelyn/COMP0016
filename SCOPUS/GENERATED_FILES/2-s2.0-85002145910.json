This paper presents an exergy-based multi-objective optimisation tool that aims to assess the impact of a diverse range of retrofit measures with a focus on non-domestic buildings. EnergyPlus was used as a dynamic calculation engine for first law analysis, while a Python add-on was developed to link dynamic exergy analysis and a Genetic Algorithm optimisation process with the aforementioned software. Two UK archetype case studies (an office and a primary school) were used to test the feasibility of the proposed framework. Different measures combinations based on retrofitting the envelope insulation levels and the application of different HVAC configurations were assessed. The objective functions in this study are annual energy use, occupants' thermal comfort, and total building exergy destructions. A large range of optimal solutions was achieved highlighting the framework capabilities. The model achieved improvements of 53% in annual energy use, 51% of exergy destructions and 66% of thermal comfort for the school building, and 50%, 33%, and 80% for the office building. This approach can be extended by using exergoeconomic optimisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building retrofits", "Building simulation", "Exergy", "Genetic algorithms", "Non-domestic buildings", "Optimisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building energy systems", "Building retrofits", "Building simulation", "Dynamic calculations", "Exergy destructions", "Non-domestic buildings", "Objective functions", "Optimisations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002145910", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57215934565": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Kerdan I.", "AuthorID": "57215934565", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "6507276018": {"Name": "Ruyssevelt P.", "AuthorID": "6507276018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "35956865000": {"Name": "Raslan R.", "AuthorID": "35956865000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}}}
