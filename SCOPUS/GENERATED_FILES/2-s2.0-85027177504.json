To verify the concept, it is designed, simulated, and also tested to harvest electromagnetic energy at 3.1 GHz. It is observed through measurements that the proposed circuit is able to transfer 18% of the RF incident power into DC power. The DC output power and RF-to-DC efficiency are investigated with respect to frequency, and also the angular position of the rectenna system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Angular positions", "Dc power", "Incident power", "Output power", "Rectenna systems", "Split ring resonator"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027177504", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"57195323079": {"Name": "Aljaloud K.", "AuthorID": "57195323079", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, Roberts Building, University College London"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, Roberts Building, University College London"}}}
