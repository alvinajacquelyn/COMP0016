It is also tailored to a UK perspective in view of the Montgomery v. Lanarkshire [2015] legal ruling and it implications to practice. We can never underestimate the power of humane care on health. The compassion and evidence based medicine agenda in healthcare is interconnected with human rights in healthcare, feeding into the principles of decision making and patient centred care. When this has not happened and there is been healthcare conflict, the power of storytelling serves to connect disparate parties to their common humanity. Narratives are an important aspect of restorative justice processes and we suggest that this could be beneficial in the field of human rights in childbirth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human rights in childbirth", "Narratives", "Obstetric violence", "Respectful maternity care", "Restorative justice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery, Obstetric", "Female", "Human Rights", "Humans", "Maternal Health Services", "Parturition", "Pregnancy", "Social Justice"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011357385", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57215370007": {"Name": "Lokugamage A.U.", "AuthorID": "57215370007", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60000641", "AffiliationName": "Whittington Hospital, Department of Women's Health, University College London, Jenner Building"}, "57193167092": {"Name": "Pathberiya S.D.C.", "AuthorID": "57193167092", "AffiliationID": "118050785", "AffiliationName": "Trustee Evelyn Oldfield Unit (NGO)"}}}
