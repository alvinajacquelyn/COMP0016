This study aims to provide a better understanding of the role of nutritional endorsements in consumers\u2019 food purchasing decisions, when evaluated across high and low involvement products. Although past research in this area does exist, a major limitation is that nutritional endorsements have been studied only for their direct effect as a single, isolated product cue on product perception\u2014rather than its importance relative to other product cues, such as price and product branding. This study overcomes this limitation through a conjoint analysis involving a sample of supermarket consumers. The findings suggest that a health endorsement plays a smaller role in influencing consumer decision-making relative to brand or price, but it is stronger for the higher involvement product. These findings provide nutritional foundations and product managers with quantifiable evidence of nutritional programs\u2019 influence in consumer decision-making, justifying the relevance of such endorsements and giving nutritional foundations specific leads for adaptions in their marketing and educational efforts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conjoint analysis", "nutritional endorsement", "product cues", "product involvement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966702115", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"56180581700": {"Name": "Montandon A.C.", "AuthorID": "56180581700", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "56179828100": {"Name": "Ogonowski A.", "AuthorID": "56179828100", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "School of Management Studies, University of Cape Town"}, "57217483548": {"Name": "Botha E.", "AuthorID": "57217483548", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "School of Management Studies, University of Cape Town"}}}
