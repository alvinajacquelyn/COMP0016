We recorded in-hospital mortality, morbidity and length of stay for 164 patients aged at least 65 years after unscheduled surgery. We evaluated pre-operative frailty with the 7-point Clinical Frailty Scale: 81 patients were \u2018not vulnerable\u2019 (frailty score 1\u20133) and 83 were \u2018vulnerable or frail\u2019 (frailty score \u2265 4), with mean (SD) ages of 74.7 (7.5) years vs. 79.4 (8.3) years, respectively, p < 0.001. Within 30 postoperative days 8/164 (5%) patients died, all with frailty scores \u2265 4, p = 0.007. Postoperative morbidity was less frequent in patients categorised as \u2018not vulnerable\u2019 on four out of the six days it was measured (days 3, 5, 8, 14, 23, 28). Median (IQR [range]) postoperative stay was 9 (6\u201318 [2\u2013221]) days for patients with frailty scores 1\u20133, and 22 (12\u201333 [2\u2013270]) days for patients with score \u2265 4, p < 0.001. Four variables independently associated with hospital discharge, hazard ratio (95%CI): E-POSSUM, 0.74 (0.60\u20130.92), p = 0.007; ASA 2, 0.35 (0.13\u20130.98), p = 0.046, ASA 3, 0.17 (0.06\u20130.47), p = 0.001 and ASA 4/5, 0.08 (0.02\u20130.28), p < 0.001; operative severity \u2018major +\u2019, 0.69 (0.41\u20131.08), p = 0.10 and the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool, 7.75 (0.81\u201374.40), p = 0.08.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ageing", "ASA physical status", "geriatric anaesthesia", "quality measures: patient care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Anesthesia", "Elective Surgical Procedures", "Emergency Medical Services", "Female", "Frail Elderly", "Frailty", "Geriatric Assessment", "Hip Fractures", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Perioperative Period", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044173555", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57190375486": {"Name": "McGuckin D.G.", "AuthorID": "57190375486", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Outcomes Research Centre, UCL/UCKH"}, "15046929200": {"Name": "Moonesinghe S.R.", "AuthorID": "15046929200", "AffiliationID": "60116802", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Centre, National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia, Royal College of Anaesthetists"}, "57201298848": {"Name": "Mufti S.", "AuthorID": "57201298848", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Elderly Care, Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201296563": {"Name": "Turner D.J.", "AuthorID": "57201296563", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Stroke and Geriatric Medicine, University College Hospital"}, "57217751432": {"Name": "Bond C.", "AuthorID": "57217751432", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Medicine for the Elderly, University College Hospital"}}}
