This was a multicenter randomized, double-blind controlled trial of 14. days of intravenous antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbations chosen based on conventional vs. biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility results in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. There were 74 exacerbations in 39 patients. A total of 46% (12/26) exacerbations in the conventional group compared to 40% (19/48) exacerbations in the biofilm group achieved a \u2265. 3 log drop in P. aeruginosa sputum density (difference - 0.03, 95% CI - 0.5 to 0.4, p. = 0.9). Lung function improvements were similar in both groups. Biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing did not lead to improved microbiological or clinical outcomes compared to conventional methods in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotics", "Biofilm", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Pulmonary exacerbation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Biofilms", "Canada", "Child", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Pseudomonas Infections", "Reproducibility of Results", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Sputum", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924225296", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7005811272": {"Name": "Yau Y.C.W.", "AuthorID": "7005811272", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbiology, Department of Pediatric Laboratory Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "56214449500": {"Name": "Ratjen F.", "AuthorID": "56214449500", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "55585860400": {"Name": "Grasemann H.", "AuthorID": "55585860400", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "22636433100": {"Name": "Stanojevic S.", "AuthorID": "22636433100", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "57211729034": {"Name": "Tullis E.", "AuthorID": "57211729034", "AffiliationID": "60085802, 60016849, 60017018", "AffiliationName": "Keenan Research Centre of Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, Department of Medicine, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "7006411112": {"Name": "Wilcox P.", "AuthorID": "7006411112", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60015670", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, St Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "7005838460": {"Name": "Freitag A.", "AuthorID": "7005838460", "AffiliationID": "60031828, 60008197", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences Center, McMaster University"}, "6604010600": {"Name": "Chilvers M.", "AuthorID": "6604010600", "AffiliationID": "60008667", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital"}, "12140140500": {"Name": "Zlosnik J.", "AuthorID": "12140140500", "AffiliationID": "60086967, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Centre for Understanding and Preventing Infection in Children, Child and Family Research Institute, University of British Columbia"}, "7005904786": {"Name": "Speert D.", "AuthorID": "7005904786", "AffiliationID": "60086967, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Centre for Understanding and Preventing Infection in Children, Child and Family Research Institute, University of British Columbia"}, "7005819978": {"Name": "Corey M.", "AuthorID": "7005819978", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Child Evaluative Health Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "6506340028": {"Name": "Matukas L.", "AuthorID": "6506340028", "AffiliationID": "60017018, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, St Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "14121426200": {"Name": "Leahy T.R.", "AuthorID": "14121426200", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "56539346900": {"Name": "Shih S.", "AuthorID": "56539346900", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "16204476200": {"Name": "Waters V.", "AuthorID": "16204476200", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}}}
