Self-service kiosks offer this potential, but there is a need for solutions to meet acceptable standards, e.g. provision of accurate measurements. This study investigates the design and optimization of a prototype healthcare kiosk to collect vital signs measures. The design problem was decomposed, formalized, focused and used to generate multiple solutions. Systematic implementation and evaluation allowed for the optimization of measurement accuracy, first for individuals and then for a population. The optimized solution was tested independently to check the suitability of the methods, and quality of the solution. The process resulted in a reduction of measurement noise and an optimal fit, in terms of the positioning of measurement devices. This guaranteed the accuracy of the solution and provides a general methodology for similar design problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Measurement accuracy", "Parameter identification", "Self-service healthcare kiosk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate measurement", "Design and optimization", "General methodologies", "Measurement accuracy", "Measurement device", "Optimized solutions", "Self-service healthcare kiosk", "Self-service kiosks", "Adult", "Adult", "Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous", "Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Community Health Services", "Community Health Services", "Delivery of Health Care", "Delivery of Health Care", "Electrocardiography", "Electrocardiography", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Design", "Female", "Female", "Human Engineering", "Human Engineering", "Humans", "Humans", "Male", "Male", "Mathematical Concepts", "Mathematical Concepts", "Posture", "Posture", "Reproducibility of Results", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Care", "Self Care", "User-Computer Interface", "User-Computer Interface", "Young Adult", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919625768", "SubjectAreas": [["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"]], "AuthorData": {"55659160300": {"Name": "Lyu Y.", "AuthorID": "55659160300", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "57210908693": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57210908693", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "7404964393": {"Name": "Shi Y.", "AuthorID": "7404964393", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "56456833400": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56456833400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "56456754800": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "56456754800", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "57200869621": {"Name": "Fang K.", "AuthorID": "57200869621", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "56457099500": {"Name": "Ding J.", "AuthorID": "56457099500", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"}, "57200304833": {"Name": "Vincent C.J.", "AuthorID": "57200304833", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College London"}, "7404592533": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "7404592533", "AffiliationID": "60026701, 60122781", "AffiliationName": "Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science"}, "55914021400": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "55914021400", "AffiliationID": "60026701, 60122781", "AffiliationName": "Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science"}}}
