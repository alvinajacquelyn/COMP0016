Many animal models are used to study neural crest induction, migration and differentiation, with amphibians and birds being the most widely used systems. A major technological advance to study neural crest development in mouse, chick and zebrafish has been the generation of transgenic animals in which neural crest specific enhancers/promoters drive the expression of either fluorescent proteins for use as lineage tracers, or modified genes for use in functional studies. Unfortunately, no such transgenic animals currently exist for the amphibians Xenopus laevis and tropicalis, key model systems for studying neural crest development. Here we describe the generation and characterization of two transgenic Xenopus laevis lines, Pax3-GFP and Sox10-GFP, in which GFP is expressed in the pre-migratory and migratory neural crest, respectively. We show that Pax3-GFP could be a powerful tool to study neural crest induction, whereas Sox10-GFP could be used in the study of neural crest migration in living embryos.", "AuthorKeywords": ["induction", "migration", "Neural crest", "Pax3", "Sox10", "transgenic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Cell Differentiation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genetic Engineering", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Humans", "Neural Crest", "Neurogenesis", "PAX3 Transcription Factor", "SOXE Transcription Factors", "Xenopus laevis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043304002", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57201073082": {"Name": "Alkobtawi M.", "AuthorID": "57201073082", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60030640, 60105761, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "UMR3347 Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud-Paris Saclay, Institut Curie/CNRS/U1021 INSERM, Centre Universitaire b\u00e2t"}, "6603641286": {"Name": "Monsoro-Burq A.H.", "AuthorID": "6603641286", "AffiliationID": "60029631", "AffiliationName": "Institut Universitaire de France"}, "55189833700": {"Name": "Ray H.", "AuthorID": "55189833700", "AffiliationID": "60119097, 60027086", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham MCLM 338"}, "35766215100": {"Name": "Barriga E.H.", "AuthorID": "35766215100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "36830043900": {"Name": "Moreno M.", "AuthorID": "36830043900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7003927871": {"Name": "Mayor R.", "AuthorID": "7003927871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "16550381800": {"Name": "Kerney R.", "AuthorID": "16550381800", "AffiliationID": "60030309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Gettysburg College Gettysburg"}, "6701569147": {"Name": "Saint-Jeannet J.P.", "AuthorID": "6701569147", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, College of Dentistry, Department of Basic Science&Craniofacial Biology"}}}
