This has resulted in an exponential increase of 450k data in recent years and triggered the development of numerous integrated analysis pipelines and stand-alone packages. This review will introduce and discuss the currently most popular pipelines and packages and is particularly aimed at new 450k users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["450k BeadChip", "Analysis pipelines", "DNA methylation", "Epigenetics", "EWAS", "HumanMethylation450"], "IndexKeywords": ["CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenomics", "Genome", "Genome, Human", "Humans", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927752388", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7201714683": {"Name": "Morris T.", "AuthorID": "7201714683", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
