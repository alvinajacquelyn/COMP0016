Deregulated levels of IL-18 are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple disorders including inflammatory and metabolic diseases, yet relatively little is known regarding its regulation. Liver X receptors or LXRs are key modulators of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis and immune responses. Here we show that LXR ligands negatively regulate LPS-induced mRNA and protein expression of IL-18 in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistent with this being an LXR-mediated process, inhibition is abolished in the presence of a specific LXR antagonist and in LXR-deficient macrophages. Additionally, IL-18 processing of its precursor inactive form to its bioactive state is inhibited by LXR through negative regulation of both pro-caspase 1 expression and activation. Finally, LXR ligands further modulate IL-18 levels by inducing the expression of IL-18BP, a potent endogenous inhibitor of IL-18. This regulation occurs via the transcription factor IRF8, thus identifying IL-18BP as a novel LXR and IRF8 target gene. In conclusion, LXR activation inhibits IL-18 production through regulation of its transcription and maturation into an active pro-inflammatory cytokine. This novel regulation of IL-18 by LXR could be applied to modulate the severity of IL-18 driven metabolic and inflammatory disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Interleukin-18", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Liver X Receptors", "Macrophages", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966990623", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14527636000": {"Name": "Pourcet B.", "AuthorID": "14527636000", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60183041", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, CHU Lille, European Genomic Institute for Diabetes"}, "24830499600": {"Name": "Gage M.C.", "AuthorID": "24830499600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "57193720070": {"Name": "Leon T.E.", "AuthorID": "57193720070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "56767870000": {"Name": "Waddington K.E.", "AuthorID": "56767870000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "11840220100": {"Name": "Pello O.M.", "AuthorID": "11840220100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "7801465530": {"Name": "Pineda-Torra I.", "AuthorID": "7801465530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "6603943805": {"Name": "Steffensen K.R.", "AuthorID": "6603943805", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institut"}, "55445301000": {"Name": "Castrillo A.", "AuthorID": "55445301000", "AffiliationID": "60009669, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "CSIC de Madrid, IUIBS, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"}, "6602429316": {"Name": "Valledor A.F.", "AuthorID": "6602429316", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, University of Barcelona"}}}
