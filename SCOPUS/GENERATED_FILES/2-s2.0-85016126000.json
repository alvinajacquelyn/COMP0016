Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify \u2018anchor\u2019 representatives: for \u03b1-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity hotspots", "Biogeography", "Community assembly", "Conservation", "Diversity metrics", "Evolutionary history", "Phylogenetic diversity", "Prioritization", "Range size"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biodiversity", "Biological Evolution", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Ecology", "Phylogeny"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016126000", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"52264559900": {"Name": "Tucker C.M.", "AuthorID": "52264559900", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado"}, "8862337100": {"Name": "Cadotte M.W.", "AuthorID": "8862337100", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Stake Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Key Laboratory of Biodiversity Dynamics and Conservation of Guangdong, Higher Education Institutes, College of Ecology and Evolution, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "24723848100": {"Name": "Carvalho S.B.", "AuthorID": "24723848100", "AffiliationID": "60027821", "AffiliationName": "CIBIO/InBIO, Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Biodiversidade e Recursos Gen\u00e9ticos da Universidade do Porto"}, "57205734691": {"Name": "Jonathan Davies T.", "AuthorID": "57205734691", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "African Centre for DNA Barcoding, University of Johannesburg"}, "7004032132": {"Name": "Ferrier S.", "AuthorID": "7004032132", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences, Climate Adaptation Flagship"}, "24721219700": {"Name": "Fritz S.A.", "AuthorID": "24721219700", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ecology, Evolution and Diversity, Goethe University"}, "15052010900": {"Name": "Grenyer R.", "AuthorID": "15052010900", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "8204555700": {"Name": "Helmus M.R.", "AuthorID": "8204555700", "AffiliationID": "60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biodiversity, Department of Biology, Temple University"}, "56575805100": {"Name": "Jin L.S.", "AuthorID": "56575805100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto"}, "6603693513": {"Name": "Mooers A.O.", "AuthorID": "6603693513", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Simon Fraser University"}, "55966387900": {"Name": "Pavoine S.", "AuthorID": "55966387900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "26029187400": {"Name": "Purschke O.", "AuthorID": "26029187400", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Martin-Luther-University"}, "35228202800": {"Name": "Winter M.", "AuthorID": "35228202800", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "German Centre of Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig"}, "15519931200": {"Name": "Redding D.W.", "AuthorID": "15519931200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "16069596100": {"Name": "Rosauer D.F.", "AuthorID": "16069596100", "AffiliationID": "60159889, 60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Biology, Australian National University"}, "6506833110": {"Name": "Mazel F.", "AuthorID": "6506833110", "AffiliationID": "60104653, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire d\u2019Ecologie Alpine (LECA), CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, (UMR 5553)"}}}
