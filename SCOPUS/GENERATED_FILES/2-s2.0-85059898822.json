Using nationally representative data (2010\u20132011), we investigate how ethnic minority gender role attitudes vary across generations and with neighborhood ethnic composition. The results show that while Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Indians, and Black Africans have more traditional attitudes than Black Caribbeans, the attitudes of the former groups are more traditional in the first than in the second generation. We also find that the gender role attitudes of Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Indians become more traditional as the local share of co-ethnic neighbors increases or the share of White British residents decreases. Importantly, these patterns are more pronounced for second-generation Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, whose gender role attitudes are more sensitive to variations in neighborhood ethnic composition than are those of the first generation. Taken together, these findings indicate that migration researchers must conceptualize and study how immigrants\u2019 cultural values are heterogeneous, fluid, and dynamic characteristics that can vary spatially across host societies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059898822", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57201742291": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57201742291", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "54392755000": {"Name": "Coulter R.", "AuthorID": "54392755000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
