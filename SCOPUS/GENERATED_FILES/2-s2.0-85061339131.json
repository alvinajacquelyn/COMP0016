This cross-sectional study evaluated HIV-1 RFs and dependency factors in HIV infected individuals with progressive or non-progressive infection, as well as in early and late treated cohorts that exhibit different viro-immunological profiles due to differences in timing of treatment-initiation. Methods: The expression profile of IFIT1, MX1, APOBEC3G, SAMHD1, BST2 (encoding TETHERIN), TRIM5, MX2, SLFN11, PAF1, PSIP1 (encoding LEDGF/p75), and NLRX1 was measured by qPCR in 104 HIV-1 positive individuals: seroconverters (SRCV; n = 19), long term non-progressors (LTNP; n = 17), viremic progressors (VP; n = 12), patients treated during seroconversion (Early treated; n = 24) or chronic infection (Late treated; n = 32), and non-infected controls. Findings: Expression levels of early treated HIV-1 positive individuals were significantly upregulated in comparison to late treated patients (IFIT1: p = 0\u00b70003; MX1: p = 0\u00b7008; APOBEC3G: p = 0\u00b7002; SAMHD1: p = 0\u00b70008; SLFN11: p < 0\u00b70001; BST2: p < 0\u00b70001). Similarly, SLFN11, BST2, and SAMHD1 were highly expressed in LTNPs at comparable levels as in early treated HIV-1 positive individuals. Furthermore, SLFN11 and SAMHD1 expression negatively correlated with total and integrated HIV-1 DNA levels. Interpretation: Early treatment initiation maintains initial RF elevation even after a decade of ART. Elevated expression of SLFN11, BST2, and SAMHD1 in LTNP and early treated subjects implies that these RFs may be associated with spontaneous virological control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohorts", "Early treatment", "HIV-1 infection", "LTNP", "Restriction factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Biomarkers", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "HIV Infections", "HIV Seropositivity", "HIV-1", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Time-to-Treatment", "Viral Load", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061339131", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57191746229": {"Name": "Van Hecke C.", "AuthorID": "57191746229", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "56394472800": {"Name": "Trypsteen W.", "AuthorID": "56394472800", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "55770482200": {"Name": "Malatinkova E.", "AuthorID": "55770482200", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "55512149500": {"Name": "Vervisch K.", "AuthorID": "55512149500", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "57194070287": {"Name": "Rutsaert S.", "AuthorID": "57194070287", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "47861332200": {"Name": "Sips M.", "AuthorID": "47861332200", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "8522177300": {"Name": "Vandekerckhove L.", "AuthorID": "8522177300", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316, 60068590", "AffiliationName": "HIV Cure Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital"}, "57221435163": {"Name": "De Spiegelaere W.", "AuthorID": "57221435163", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Morphology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University"}, "56619837100": {"Name": "Kinloch-de Loes S.", "AuthorID": "56619837100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunitys, Royal Free Hospital and Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
