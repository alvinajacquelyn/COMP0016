Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Can social media data be used as an alternative to traditional surveys to understand tourists\u2019 preferences for nature-based experiences in protected areas? We explored this by comparing preferences for biodiversity obtained from a traditional survey conducted in Kruger National Park, South Africa, with observed preferences assessed from over 13,600 pictures shared on Instagram and Flickr by tourists visiting the park in the same period. We found no significant difference between the preferences of tourists as stated in the surveys and the preferences revealed by social media content. Overall, large-bodied mammals were found to be the favorite group, both in the survey and on social media platforms. However, Flickr was found to better match tourists\u2019 preference for less-charismatic biodiversity. Our findings suggest that social media content can be used as a cost-efficient way to explore, and for more continuous monitoring of, preferences for biodiversity and human activities in protected areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity conservation", "conservation marketing", "ecotourism", "Flickr", "Instagram", "social media"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013447195", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"56735962800": {"Name": "Hausmann A.", "AuthorID": "56735962800", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Amarula Elephant Research Programme, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7004596566": {"Name": "Slotow R.", "AuthorID": "7004596566", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College"}, "25929833700": {"Name": "Di Minin E.", "AuthorID": "25929833700", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki"}, "7003603971": {"Name": "Toivonen T.", "AuthorID": "7003603971", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki"}, "56523034300": {"Name": "Tenkanen H.", "AuthorID": "56523034300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki"}, "56668748800": {"Name": "Heikinheimo V.", "AuthorID": "56668748800", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki"}, "57200306804": {"Name": "Moilanen A.", "AuthorID": "57200306804", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Centre of Excellence in Metapopulation Research, Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki"}}}
