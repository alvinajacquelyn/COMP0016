In order to properly manage freshwater ecosystems, we must have a better understanding of the ecological response to human-induced stressors, especially in multiple stressor environments. When long-term observational records are scarce or non-existent, paleolimnology provides a means to understanding ecological response to long-term stress. Lake Gusinoye is a large, deep lake in continental southeast Siberia, and has been subject to multiple human-induced stressors since the 19th century. Diatom assemblages since the late 17th century were reconstructed from a Lake Gusinoye sediment core to increase our understanding of the response of primary producer communities to centuries of environmental change. Records of anthropogenic contamination of Lake Gusinoye (as indicated by spheroidal carbonaceous particle, trace metal, and element records) indicate increases in regional and local development c. 1920. Diatom assemblages were initially dominated by Aulacoseira granulata, which declined beginning in the 18th century, likely as a response to hydrological change in the Gusinoye basin due to regional climate warming following the termination of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Significant diatom compositional turnover was observed since the 19th century at Lake Gusinoye. Since the early 20th century, Lake Gusinoye diatom assemblages have changed more profoundly as a result of multiple anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient influx, aquaculture, and wastewater discharge from the Gusinoozersk State Regional Power Plant. Recent diatom assemblages are dominated by Lindavia ocellata and nutrient-rich species, including Fragilaria crotonensis and Asterionella formosa. Evidence of continued nutrient enrichment at Lake Gusinoye is likely due to aquaculture in the lake, and suggests potential interactive effects of warming regional temperatures and increasing nutrients (eutrophication).", "AuthorKeywords": ["aquaculture", "climate change", "eutrophication", "nitrogen deposition", "paleolimnology", "Russia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064509425", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"36143983900": {"Name": "Adams J.K.", "AuthorID": "36143983900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.L.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "7202401987": {"Name": "Mackay A.W.", "AuthorID": "7202401987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "55941382000": {"Name": "Peng Y.", "AuthorID": "55941382000", "AffiliationID": "60005865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Rural Construction, Shaoyang University"}, "23989643500": {"Name": "Shchetnikov A.A.", "AuthorID": "23989643500", "AffiliationID": "60108268", "AffiliationName": "Irkutsk Scientific Center, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}}}
