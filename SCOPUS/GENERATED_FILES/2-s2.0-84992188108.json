The developed TCNSP composite has high specific surface area (i.e., 454 m2/g) and great porosity (i.e., 66.9%) with pore size of less than 5 \u03bcm. High removal efficiencies (\u226595%) of HA were observed due to the significant synergistic effects by coupling adsorption and photocatalytic reaction of TCNSP composite. As the initial concentration of HA increased, the degradation rate (Kapp) decreased due to HA sorption saturation to the surface of TCNSP composite and the photon interception by HA molecules in aqueous solution. Since the increased loading amount of TCNSP composite enhanced the number of active sites, Kapp values increased until the optimum loading amount of TCNSP composite. As pH values increased, HA removal efficiency decreased due to increasing electrostatic repulsion between HA and TCNSP composite. Based on the response surface methodology, higher HA removal efficiencies were obtained with acidic condition, longer reaction time, and appropriated loading amount of TCNSP. Further pilot-scale study is in progress using TCNSP composite combined with UVC to remove HA from large amounts of surface water (i.e., 200 m3/d).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrostatic repulsion", "High specific surface area", "Initial concentration", "Number of active sites", "Photo catalytic degradation", "Photocatalytic reactions", "Photocatalytic systems", "Response surface methodology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992188108", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55557006700": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "55557006700", "AffiliationID": "60004580", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Kyungnam University"}, "55921298800": {"Name": "Jang D.", "AuthorID": "55921298800", "AffiliationID": "60104012", "AffiliationName": "Department of Construction Environment Engineering, University of Science and Technology"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57191633015": {"Name": "Jung Y.", "AuthorID": "57191633015", "AffiliationID": "60015576", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Construction Materials Testing Center, Keimyung University"}, "57197739998": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "57197739998", "AffiliationID": "60007215", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Chonnam National University"}, "36936487000": {"Name": "Joo J.", "AuthorID": "36936487000", "AffiliationID": "60068689", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hanbat National University"}}}
