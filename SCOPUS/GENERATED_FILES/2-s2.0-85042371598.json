Secondary objectives included evaluating why mpMRI missed significant cancer. Materials and methods: 101 men received pre-biopsy mpMRI and TPM-biopsy over 16 months. Disease status was assigned at hemigland level. Primary histological definition of clinical significance was Gleason grade >/ = 4 + 3 or maximum cancer core length (MCCL) >/ = 6 mm. Positive mpMRI was defined as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score >/ = 3. Results: Median age 69 (IQR 62\u201376). Median PSA 7 ng/ml (IQR 4.6\u20139.8). mpMRI had sensitivity 76.9%, specificity 60.7%, PPV 40.4% and NPV 88.3% at primary definitions. For detecting any Gleason >/ = 7 mpMRI had sensitivity 73.2%, specificity 60.3%, PPV 41.4% and NPV 85.4%. Mean MCCL was lower where significant cancer was missed compared to those correctly identified (5.8 mm versus 7.7 mm respectively, p = 0.035). Conclusion: mpMRI performance characteristics were very encouraging when compared to contemporary clinical trials. In a non-academic hospital setting, negative mpMRI was just as good at ruling-out significant disease, though the ability of positive mpMRI to accurately detect significant disease was lower. An mpMRI-guided diagnostic pathway should be accompanied by appropriate mpMRI protocol optimisation, training, and quality control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic resonance imaging", "Needle biopsy", "Predictive value of tests", "Prostatic neoplasm"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042371598", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57200754683": {"Name": "Chau E.M.", "AuthorID": "57200754683", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "35336774700": {"Name": "Kasivisvanathan V.", "AuthorID": "35336774700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "55925707400": {"Name": "Petrides N.", "AuthorID": "55925707400", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "14027657700": {"Name": "Virdi J.", "AuthorID": "14027657700", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "57193878236": {"Name": "McKenzie J.", "AuthorID": "57193878236", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "35147480300": {"Name": "Aldin Z.", "AuthorID": "35147480300", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Urology, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
