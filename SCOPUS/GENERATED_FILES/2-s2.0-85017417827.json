This chapter shows how it can be used to represent threat. It illustrates this with a model of maritime piracy: the pirates threaten shipping, naval vessels can offer some defence. The chapter also shows the likely density of vessels passing through the Gulf to and from the Suez Canal. It explores how this is constructed as part of the model. To formulate the model, the authors define the a few variables. These include spatial deterrence functions with parameters \u03bc and \u03bd. \u03b2 determines the range of the pirates from bases, \u03bc the extent to which ships are likely to be found at some distance from what is regarded as the optimal route, and \u03bd the effectiveness of naval deterrence in a cell some distance away from the actual vessel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Maritime piracy", "Shipping", "Spatial deterrence functions", "Spatial interaction modelling", "Threat"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017417827", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"36468817000": {"Name": "Marchione E.", "AuthorID": "36468817000", "AffiliationID": "118346059", "AffiliationName": "Ab Initio Software Corporation"}, "7404870460": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "7404870460", "AffiliationID": "118346000", "AffiliationName": "Home Office Science Advisory Council"}}}
