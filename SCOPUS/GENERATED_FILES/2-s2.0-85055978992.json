The aim of this prospective community-based study was to investigate the neuropsychological development of infants with newly diagnosed epilepsy longitudinally and to identify the clinical factors that predict long-term impairment. Methods: Sixty-six infants <24 months of age were enrolled in the baseline phase of this study; 40 were seen again at 1-year follow-up and 40 at 3-year follow-up. Children underwent a neurological and neuropsychological assessment at each time point. Results: More than 55% of children demonstrated impaired cognitive functioning at each assessment, with a similar percentage showing impaired memory and attention at 3-year follow-up. Cognitive scores obtained at each time point were correlated. More than 20 seizures/seizure clusters prior to assessment and an abnormal neurologic examination predicted poor cognitive functioning at baseline, whereas continuing seizures and baseline cognitive score predicted 3-year intelligence quotient (IQ)/cognitive score. Significance: These findings demonstrate the following: (1) infants who are performing poorly at baseline continue to display impaired development at follow-up, (2) these children are delayed across a range of neuropsychological functions, and (3) a high number of seizures close to initial diagnosis and continuing seizures at follow-up independently predict cognitive impairment. These findings help to identify those infants with new-onset epilepsy who are most at risk for poor developmental outcome and suggest that multimodal interventions should be instituted early in the course of the disorder to improve outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive development", "cognitive outcome", "epilepsy in infancy", "neurologic predictors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Cognition", "Developmental Disabilities", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Intelligence Tests", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Neurologic Examination", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Predictive Value of Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055978992", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37026799300": {"Name": "O'Reilly H.", "AuthorID": "37026799300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57210546602": {"Name": "Bennett K.", "AuthorID": "57210546602", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "12769712600": {"Name": "Eltze C.", "AuthorID": "12769712600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57206759762": {"Name": "Webb R.", "AuthorID": "57206759762", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "26023170400": {"Name": "Helen Cross J.", "AuthorID": "26023170400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "de Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6506815139": {"Name": "Verhaert K.", "AuthorID": "6506815139", "AffiliationID": "116198816", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Center for Children and Youth Pulderbos"}, "57204534617": {"Name": "Merrett A.", "AuthorID": "57204534617", "AffiliationID": "60171144", "AffiliationName": "Dorset HealthCare University Foundation NHS Trust"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont"}, "45661844500": {"Name": "Whitney A.", "AuthorID": "45661844500", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
