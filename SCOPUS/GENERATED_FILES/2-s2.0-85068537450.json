IMP1 function relies on the recognition of a diverse set of mRNA targets that is mediated by the combinatorial action of multiple RNAbinding domains. Here, we dissect the structure and RNA-binding properties of two key RNA-binding domains of IMP1, KH1 and KH2, and we build a kinetic model for the recognition of RNA targets. Our data and model explain how the two domains are organized as an intermolecular pseudo-dimer and that the important role they play in mRNA target recognition is underpinned by the high RNA-binding affinity and fast kinetics of this KH1KH2-RNA recognition unit. Importantly, the high-affinity RNA-binding by KH1KH2 is achieved by an inter-domain coupling 50- fold stronger than that existing in a second pseudodimer in the protein, KH3KH4. The presence of this strong coupling supports a role of RNA re-modelling in IMP1 recognition of known cancer targets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Cloning, Molecular", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Escherichia coli", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical", "Protein Conformation, beta-Strand", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc", "Recombinant Proteins", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068537450", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"12772820600": {"Name": "Dagil R.", "AuthorID": "12772820600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Parasitology, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen"}, "36058910300": {"Name": "Hobor F.", "AuthorID": "36058910300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "57193001984": {"Name": "Ramos A.", "AuthorID": "57193001984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "24537021500": {"Name": "Ball N.J.", "AuthorID": "24537021500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7202126752": {"Name": "Taylor I.A.", "AuthorID": "7202126752", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "53464025700": {"Name": "Ogrodowicz R.W.", "AuthorID": "53464025700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "6602710836": {"Name": "Purkiss A.G.", "AuthorID": "6602710836", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7404840773": {"Name": "Martin S.R.", "AuthorID": "7404840773", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "8249598000": {"Name": "Kelly G.", "AuthorID": "8249598000", "AffiliationID": "60107285, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biomedical NMR Centre, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
