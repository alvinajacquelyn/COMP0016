The purpose of this study was to evaluate overall transplant survival and to identify risk factors associated with death after transplant. Methods The Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Registry, a population-based cohort, was used to describe survival after lung transplant. Pre-transplant factors associated with post-transplant survival were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results Between 1988 and 2012, 580 patients received a lung transplant. In the entire cohort, post-lung transplant 1-year survival was 87.8%, 5-year survival was 66.7%, and 10-year survival was 50.2%. Median post-transplant survival was 3.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13-6.56) in patients infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex compared with 12.36 years (95% CI = 10.34-17.96) in patients without B cepacia infection (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.63, 95% CI = 2.0-3.44). After adjustment, there was a non-significant trend toward better post-transplant survival with increasing year of transplant (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96-1.00). Pancreatic sufficiency (HR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.41-3.20) and age at transplant such that youngest and oldest had the poorest survival (p < 0.001) were significant negative predictors of survival. The risk of death after transplant for patients infected with B cepacia was highest within the first year (HR = 6.29, 95% CI = 3.87-10.21) but remained elevated >1 year after transplant (HR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.33-2.77) compared with patients without B cepacia infection. Conclusions After lung transplantation, 5-year survival in Canadians with CF is 67%, and 50% of patients live >10 years. Despite these impressive probabilities, age at transplant, pancreatic sufficiency and B cepacia infection remain important determinants of survival after lung transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B. cepacia complex", "cystic fibrosis", "lung transplantation", "survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Burkholderia cepacia complex", "Burkholderia Infections", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Lung Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938968629", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"55642233800": {"Name": "Stephenson A.L.", "AuthorID": "55642233800", "AffiliationID": "60193840, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"}, "54793496300": {"Name": "Sykes J.", "AuthorID": "54793496300", "AffiliationID": "60085802, 60017018, 60085801", "AffiliationName": "Keenan Research Centre, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital"}, "22636433100": {"Name": "Stanojevic S.", "AuthorID": "22636433100", "AffiliationID": "60193840, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"}, "7101721082": {"Name": "Singer L.G.", "AuthorID": "7101721082", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Lung Transplant Program, University Health Network"}, "7003488718": {"Name": "Berthiaume Y.", "AuthorID": "7003488718", "AffiliationID": "60002878, 60009657", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montr\u00e9al, Centre hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "7006787120": {"Name": "Aaron S.D.", "AuthorID": "7006787120", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa"}, "7005867637": {"Name": "Whitmore G.A.", "AuthorID": "7005867637", "AffiliationID": "60116868, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University"}}}
