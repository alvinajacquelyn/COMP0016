Truth conditional models focus on the logical aspects of language, the denotations of phrases, and their compositional properties. In the latter approach the denotation of a sentence determines its truth conditions and can be taken to be a truth value, a set of possible worlds, a context change potential, or similar. In this short paper, we develop a vector semantics for language based on the simply typed lambda calculus. Our semantics uses techniques familiar from the truth conditional tradition and is based on a form of dynamic interpretation inspired by Heim\u2019s context updates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compositionality", "Context change potential", "Context update", "Simply typed lambda calculus", "Vector semantics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compositionality", "Context change potential", "Context update", "Simply typed lambda calculus", "Vector semantics"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006054209", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55884592000": {"Name": "Muskens R.", "AuthorID": "55884592000", "AffiliationID": "60017145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, Tilburg University"}, "24339612000": {"Name": "Sadrzadeh M.", "AuthorID": "24339612000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
