All rights reserved.ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a major category of membrane-associated bacterial protein structures involved in the transport of a wide range of substrates. Streptococcus pneumoniae has over 60 ABC transporters, most of which are conserved in all strains. Around two-thirds of S. pneumoniae ABC transporters are importers associated with lipoproteins required for the uptake of various substrates including micronutrients, peptides, and sugars. The remaining ABC transporters export quorum-sensing peptides, drugs (including antibiotics), and antimicrobial peptides from the bacterial cytosol. ABC transporter functions are often partially redundant as other ABC and non-ABC transporter systems import the same substrates. Many ABC transporters have important effects on pathogen-host interactions, either by improving bacterial growth in nutrient-restricted conditions, wider effects on bacterial physiology, or by reducing sensitivity to host antimicrobial peptides or to antibiotics. As a consequence, ABC transporters have a fundamental role in S. pneumoniae biology and virulence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABC transporters", "Cations", "Lipoproteins", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Virulence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052651797", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"15724877000": {"Name": "Durmort C.", "AuthorID": "15724877000", "AffiliationID": "60011447, 60016067", "AffiliationName": "CEA, DSV, IBS"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, University College London"}}}
