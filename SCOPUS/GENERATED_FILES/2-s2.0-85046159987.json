Arthroplasty", "Volume": "33", "Issue": 8, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2496, "PageEnd": 2501, "CitedBy": 29, "DOI": "10.1016/j.arth.2018.03.042", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046159987&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.Background: The objective of this study was to compare macroscopic bone and soft tissue injury between robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty (CJ-TKA) and create a validated classification system for reporting iatrogenic bone and periarticular soft tissue injury after TKA. Methods: This study included 30 consecutive CJ-TKAs followed by 30 consecutive RA-TKAs performed by a single surgeon. Intraoperative photographs of the femur, tibia, and periarticular soft tissues were taken before implantation of prostheses. Using these outcomes, the macroscopic soft tissue injury (MASTI) classification system was developed to grade iatrogenic bone and soft tissue injuries. Interobserver and Intraobserver validity of the proposed classification system was assessed. Results: Patients undergoing RA-TKA had reduced medial soft tissue injury in both passively correctible (P <.05) and noncorrectible varus deformities (P <.05); more pristine femoral (P <.05) and tibial (P <.05) bone resection cuts; and improved MASTI scores compared to CJ-TKA (P <.05). There was high interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.92 [95% confidence interval: 0.88-0.96], P <.05) and intraobserver agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.94 [95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.97], P <.05) of the proposed MASTI classification system. Conclusion: There is reduced bone and periarticular soft tissue injury in patients undergoing RA-TKA compared to CJ-TKA. The proposed MASTI classification system is a reproducible grading scheme for describing iatrogenic bone and soft tissue injury in TKA. Clinical Relevance: RA-TKA is associated with reduced bone and soft tissue injury compared with conventional jig-based TKA. The proposed MASTI classification may facilitate further research correlating macroscopic soft tissue injury during TKA to long-term clinical and functional outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bone trauma", "classification", "robotic surgery", "soft tissue injury", "total knee arthroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Bone and Bones", "Female", "Femur", "Humans", "Iatrogenic Disease", "Knee Injuries", "Knee Joint", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Prospective Studies", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Soft Tissue Injuries", "Tibia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046159987", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "110074440", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "110074440", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "56504959400": {"Name": "Pietrzak J.R.T.", "AuthorID": "56504959400", "AffiliationID": "110074440", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "110074440", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}}}
