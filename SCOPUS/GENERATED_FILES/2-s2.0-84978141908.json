Compared with the traditional way that dividing the simulation domain with uniform grid directly, an enhanced narrow-band approach using the parallel cuckoo hashing method was taken to index the coarse-level surface vertices, hence decrease the memory consumption. Moreover, a two-level spatial uniform grid structure was employed with a scheme of arranging the fine surface vertices, which could preserve the spatial locality property to facilitate the coalesced memory access on the GPU. Our algorithm was designed for parallel architectures, based on which a parallel version of the optimized surface reconstruction was performed on the CUDA platform. In the experiment of comparison to traditional approaches, the results indicated that our surface reconstruction method was more efficient at the same level of quality of the reconstructed surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cuckoo hashing", "Fluids simulation", "Smoothed particle hydrodynamics", "Surface reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coalesced memory access", "Cuckoo hashing", "Memory consumption", "Reconstructed surfaces", "Reconstruction method", "Simulation domain", "Smoothed particle hydrodynamics", "Traditional approaches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978141908", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56724816200": {"Name": "Wu W.", "AuthorID": "56724816200", "AffiliationID": "60022422", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China"}, "35203367300": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "35203367300", "AffiliationID": "60022422", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China"}, "56277504500": {"Name": "Su T.", "AuthorID": "56277504500", "AffiliationID": "60002033, 60088460", "AffiliationName": "The First Institute of Oceanography, SOA"}, "36554332900": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "36554332900", "AffiliationID": "60002033, 60088460", "AffiliationName": "The First Institute of Oceanography, SOA"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60002798", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Research Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
