Bronze coins coming from the area of the Mediterranean basin, dated back the II\u2013X Cent. A.D., were analyzed using different physical analytical techniques. Characteristic X-ray fluorescence was used with electrons and photons, in order to investigate the elemental composition of both the surface layers and bulk. Moreover, the quadrupole mass spectrometry coupled to laser ablation (LAMQS technique) in high vacuum was used to analyse typical material compounds from surface contamination. Mass spectrometry, at high resolution and sensitivity, extended up to 300 amu, allowed measuring the 208 Pb/ 206 Pb and 207 Pb/ 206 Pb isotopic ratios into the coins. Quantitative relative analyses of these isotopic ratios identify the coin composition such as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d depending on the mineral used to extract the lead. Isotopic ratios in coins can be compared to those of the possible minerals used to produce the bronze alloy. A comparison between the measured isotope ratios in the analyzed coins and the literature database, related to the mineral containing Pb as a function of its geological and geophysical extraction mine, is presented. The analysis, restricted to old coins and the mines of the Mediterranean basin, indicates a possible correlation between the coin compositions and the possible geological sites of the extracted mineral.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bronze coins", "Laser ablation", "Lead isotopes", "Mass quadrupole spectrometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bronze coins", "Characteristic x rays", "Comparative analysis", "Elemental compositions", "Lead isotope", "Quadrupole mass spectrometry", "Quadrupoles", "Surface contaminations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977658240", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"23490532700": {"Name": "Torrisi L.", "AuthorID": "23490532700", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Earth Sciences, Messina University"}, "6602752464": {"Name": "Italiano A.", "AuthorID": "6602752464", "AffiliationID": "60021660", "AffiliationName": "INFN, Sezione di Catania, Gruppo collegato di Messina"}, "56519604100": {"Name": "Torrisi A.", "AuthorID": "56519604100", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Military University of Technology"}}}
