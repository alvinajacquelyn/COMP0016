For effective immunotherapy against Alzheimer's disease, recent clinical data indicate that monoclonal antibodies directed against the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide should be administered before the onset of symptoms associated with irreversible brain damage. It is therefore critical to develop technologies for continuous antibody delivery applicable to disease prevention. Here, we addressed this question using a bioactive cellular implant to deliver recombinant anti-amyloid-\u03b2 antibodies in the subcutaneous tissue. An encapsulating device permeable to macromolecules supports the long-term survival of myogenic cells over more than 10 months in immunocompetent allogeneic recipients. The encapsulated cells are genetically engineered to secrete high levels of anti-amyloid-\u03b2 antibodies. Peripheral implantation leads to continuous antibody delivery to reach plasma levels that exceed 50 \u03bcg/ml. In a proof-of-concept study, we show that the recombinant antibodies produced by this system penetrate the brain and bind amyloid plaques in two mouse models of the Alzheimer's pathology. When encapsulated cells are implanted before the onset of amyloid plaque deposition in TauPS2APP mice, chronic exposure to anti-amyloid-\u03b2 antibodies dramatically reduces amyloid-\u03b240 and amyloid-\u03b242 levels in the brain, decreases amyloid plaque burden, and most notably, prevents phospho-tau pathology in the hippocampus. These results support the use of encapsulated cell implants for passive immunotherapy against the misfolded proteins, which accumulate in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "antibody", "cellular implant", "encapsulation", "immunization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Brain", "Cells, Cultured", "Drug Implants", "Immunization, Passive", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neuroprotection", "Peptide Fragments", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Recombinant Proteins", "Subcutaneous Absorption", "Tauopathies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966549018", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"14321840000": {"Name": "Lathuili\u00e8re A.", "AuthorID": "14321840000", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "57189097409": {"Name": "Laversenne V.", "AuthorID": "57189097409", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "7402402024": {"Name": "Schneider B.", "AuthorID": "7402402024", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "57206928318": {"Name": "Aebischer P.", "AuthorID": "57206928318", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "54909987700": {"Name": "Stampanoni M.", "AuthorID": "54909987700", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "6603538923": {"Name": "Kopetzki E.", "AuthorID": "6603538923", "AffiliationID": "116662041", "AffiliationName": "Pharma Research and Early Development, DTA Neuroscience, Roche Innovation Center Penzberg"}, "7103073468": {"Name": "Jacobsen H.", "AuthorID": "7103073468", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Pharma Research and Early Development, DTA Neuroscience, Roche Innovation Center Basel"}, "55912874200": {"Name": "Bohrmann B.", "AuthorID": "55912874200", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Pharma Research and Early Development, DTA Neuroscience, Roche Innovation Center Basel"}}}
