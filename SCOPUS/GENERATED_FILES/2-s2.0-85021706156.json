Nihonjingakko is a full-Time day school for children of Japanese sojourners. The study investigates the complex language ideologies circulating in the school. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the school principal and language teachers, and were supplemented by other datasets such as questionnaires and analysis of teaching materials. Drawing on the conceptual framework of imagined communities (Anderson 1991; Kanno & Norton, 2003), this paper attempts to illuminate the fact that English receives higher language status than French. However, this article will mainly focus on English. To conclude, Japan's school and university entrance examination system can be seen to make students lose interest in learning foreign languages other than English.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belgium", "English", "French", "Japan's Overseas School Education", "Language ideologies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021706156", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57194706659": {"Name": "Mogi Y.", "AuthorID": "57194706659", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Culture, University College London, Institute of Education"}}}
