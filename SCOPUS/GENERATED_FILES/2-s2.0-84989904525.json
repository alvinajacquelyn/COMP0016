The copper slags around Phalaborwa have unusual mineral assemblages, attributable to the unique geochemistry of the main ore body, the Phalaborwa Complex, where copper minerals were mined from a carbonatite composed of magnetite, calcite and apatite. Strongly reducing conditions had to be avoided to minimise contamination of the copper with iron and phosphorus. As the copper ores contain almost no silicates, silica/alumina flux was added to produce slag. The Precambrian zinc-copper ores of the Murchison Range were also smelted, but during smelting any zinc that was not volatilised was taken up by minerals in the slag, so brass was not produced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeometallurgy", "Copper", "Mining", "Slag", "Smelting", "South Africa", "Technology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989904525", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"8288127300": {"Name": "Killick D.", "AuthorID": "8288127300", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "School of Anthropology, University of Arizona"}, "7408347737": {"Name": "Miller D.", "AuthorID": "7408347737", "AffiliationID": "60015706", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of the Free State"}, "26656244000": {"Name": "Thondhlana T.", "AuthorID": "26656244000", "AffiliationID": "60122201", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Museums Studies, Great Zimbabwe University"}, "15026923300": {"Name": "Martin\u00f3n-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "15026923300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
