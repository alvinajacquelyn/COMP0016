Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are examples of contrasting B-cell cancers; BL is a highly aggressive lymphoid tumor, frequently affecting children, whereas CLL typically presents as an indolent, slow-progressing leukemia affecting the elderly. The B-cell-specific overexpression of the myc and TCL1 oncogenes in mice induce spontaneous malignancies modeling BL and CLL, respectively. Quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics and isobaric labeling were employed to examine the biology underpinning contrasting E\u03b2-myc and E\u03b2-TCL1 B-cell tumors. Additionally, the plasma proteome was evaluated using subproteome enrichment to interrogate biomarker emergence and the systemic effects of tumor burden. Over 10,000 proteins were identified (q<0.01) of which 8270 cellular and 2095 plasma proteins were quantitatively profiled. A common B-cell tumor signature of 695 overexpressed proteins highlighted ribosome biogenesis, cell-cycle promotion and chromosome segregation. E\u03b2-myc tumors overexpressed several methylating enzymes and underexpressed many cytoskeletal components. E\u03b2-TCL1 tumors specifically overexpressed ER stress response proteins and signaling components in addition to both subunits of the interleukin-5 (IL5) receptor. IL5 treatment promoted E\u03b2-TCL1 tumor proliferation, suggesting an amplification of IL5-induced AKT signaling by TCL1. Tumor plasma contained a substantial tumor lysis signature, most prominent in E\u03b2-myc plasma, whereas E\u03b2-TCL1 plasma contained signatures of immune-response, inflammation and microenvironment interactions, with putative biomarkers in early-stage cancer. These findings provide a detailed characterization of contrasting B-cell tumor models, identifying common and specific tumor mechanisms. Integrated plasma proteomics allowed the dissection of a systemic response and a tumor lysis signature present in early-and late-stage cancers, respectively. Overall, this study suggests common B-cell cancer signatures exist and illustrates the potential of the further evaluation of B-cell cancer subtypes by integrative proteomics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Burkitt Lymphoma", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell", "Mass Spectrometry", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Proteomics", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016001461", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56406921800": {"Name": "Johnston H.E.", "AuthorID": "56406921800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Proteomic Research, Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield Campus"}, "35519277800": {"Name": "Carter M.J.", "AuthorID": "35519277800", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "35069270300": {"Name": "Cox K.L.", "AuthorID": "35069270300", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "54880576700": {"Name": "Dunscombe M.", "AuthorID": "54880576700", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "6701881225": {"Name": "Cragg M.S.", "AuthorID": "6701881225", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "56491154200": {"Name": "Manousopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "56491154200", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "55931683100": {"Name": "Garbis S.D.", "AuthorID": "55931683100", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "7201800473": {"Name": "Townsend P.A.", "AuthorID": "7201800473", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60120601, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Clinical Cancer Sciences, Paterson Building, Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester"}}}
