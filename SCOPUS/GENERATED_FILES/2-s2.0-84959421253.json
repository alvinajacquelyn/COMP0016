To explore this proposed role, we recorded the LFP and simultaneously the spike activity of one to three nearby neurons in V1 of anesthetized cats during the presentation of drifting sinusoidal gratings, binary dense noise stimuli, and natural movies. In all stimulus conditions and during spontaneous activity, the average LFP power at frequencies >20 Hz was higher when neurons were spiking versus not spiking. The spikes were weakly but significantly phase locked to all frequencies of the LFP. The average spike phase of the LFP was stable across high and low levels of LFP power, but the strength of phase locking at low frequencies (\u226410 Hz) increased with increasing LFP power. In a next step, we studied how strong stimulus responses of single neurons are reflected in the LFP and the LFP\u2013spike relationship. We found that LFP power was slightly increased and phase locking was slightly stronger during strong compared with weak stimulus-locked responses. In summary, the coupling strength between high frequencies of the LFP and spikes was not strongly modulated by LFP power, which is thought to reflect spiking synchrony, nor was it strongly influenced by how strongly the neuron was driven by the stimulus. Furthermore, a comparison between neighboring neurons showed no clustering of preferred LFP phase. We argue that hypotheses on the relevance of phase locking in their current form are inconsistent with our findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Local field potential", "Natural stimuli", "Neighboring neurons", "Neural communication", "Phase locking", "Primary visual cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cats", "Female", "Male", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959421253", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7402550598": {"Name": "Martin K.", "AuthorID": "7402550598", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60025858, 60070530", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Z\u00fcrich, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "56385139100": {"Name": "Schr\u00f6der S.", "AuthorID": "56385139100", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60025858, 60070530", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Z\u00fcrich, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}}}
