Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse between motoneurons and skeletal muscle, and is responsible for eliciting muscle contraction. Neurotransmission at synapses depends on the release of synaptic vesicles at sites called active zones (AZs). Various proteins of the extracellular matrix are crucial for NMJ development; however, little is known about the identity and functions of the receptors that mediate their effects. Using genetically modified mice, we find that integrin-\u03b13 (encoded by Itga3), an adhesion receptor at the presynaptic membrane, is involved in the localisation of AZ components and efficient synaptic vesicle release. Integrin-\u03b13 also regulates integrity of the synapse - mutant NMJs present with progressive structural changes and upregulated autophagy, features commonly observed during ageing and in models of neurodegeneration. Unexpectedly, we find instances of nerve terminal detachment from the muscle fibre; to our knowledge, this is the first report of a receptor that is required for the physical anchorage of pre- and postsynaptic elements at the NMJ. These results demonstrate multiple roles of integrin-\u03b13 at the NMJ, and suggest that alterations in its function could underlie defects that occur in neurodegeneration or ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adhesion receptor", "Ageing", "Autophagy", "Neurodegeneration", "Synapse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Calcium", "Embryonic Development", "Integrin alpha3", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Motor Neurons", "Muscle Development", "Muscle Fibers, Skeletal", "Mutation", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Protein Transport", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission", "Synaptic Vesicles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019243618", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57192690938": {"Name": "Ross J.A.", "AuthorID": "57192690938", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences, Guy's Campus, King's College"}, "23979624200": {"Name": "Bencze M.", "AuthorID": "23979624200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7102919774": {"Name": "Conti F.J.", "AuthorID": "7102919774", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587406100": {"Name": "Webster R.G.", "AuthorID": "35587406100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "18533793500": {"Name": "Cetin H.", "AuthorID": "18533793500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7007141918": {"Name": "Beeson D.", "AuthorID": "7007141918", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "15846437200": {"Name": "Lechertier T.", "AuthorID": "15846437200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8148082000": {"Name": "Reynolds L.E.", "AuthorID": "8148082000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57194212814": {"Name": "Hodilvala-Dilke K.", "AuthorID": "57194212814", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6701556011": {"Name": "Turmaine M.", "AuthorID": "6701556011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57195074187": {"Name": "Jamshidi Y.", "AuthorID": "57195074187", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London"}}}
