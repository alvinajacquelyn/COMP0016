The mechanisms of the dielectric relaxation in these two composites do not differ from each other. For more precise characterization of the dielectric relaxation, a two dimensional distribution of relaxation times was calculated from the temperature dependencies of the complex dielectric permittivity. The results obtained from the 2D distribution and the mean relaxation time are found to be consistent. The dynamics of the dielectric permittivity is described by the Arrhenius law. The energy and attempt time of the dielectric relaxators lie in a narrow energy and time region thus proving that the single type chains of polymer are responsible for a dispersion. The magnetic properties of the composites were investigated using the ferromagnetic resonance. A single resonance line was observed for both samples. From the temperature dependence (100 K - 310 K) of the resonance field and linewidth, the origin of the observed line was attributed to the NiFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> and Ni<inf>0.5</inf>Zn<inf>0.5</inf>Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> superparamagnetic nanoparticles. By measuring films at different orientations with respect to the external magnetic field, the angular dependence of the resonance was observed, indicating the magnetic dipolar in-plane interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dielectric spectroscopy", "Ferrites", "Ferromagnetic resonance", "Magnetoelectric composites", "PVDF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex dielectric permittivities", "Dielectric permittivities", "Magnetoelectric composites", "Polyvinylidene fluorides", "PVDF", "Superparamagnetic nanoparticles", "Temperature dependencies", "Two dimensional distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934955070", "SubjectAreas": [["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55247446500": {"Name": "Svirskas S.", "AuthorID": "55247446500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "Simenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University"}, "36624044700": {"Name": "Martins P.", "AuthorID": "36624044700", "AffiliationID": "60110238", "AffiliationName": "International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory"}, "57211501457": {"Name": "Lanceros-Mendez S.", "AuthorID": "57211501457", "AffiliationID": "60110238", "AffiliationName": "International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory"}}}
