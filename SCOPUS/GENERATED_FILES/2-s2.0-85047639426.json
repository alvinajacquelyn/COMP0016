In this paper, a time-domain hydrodynamic model for describing the motion of electrons in plasmonic nanostructures is presented, in which both surface and bulk nonlinearity are considered. A coupled Maxwell-hydrodynamic system capturing full-wave physics and free-electron dynamics is numerically solved with the parallel finite-difference time-domain method. The validation of the proposed method is presented by simulating a plasmonic metasurface. The linear response is compared with the Drude dispersion model and the nonlinear terahertz emission from a difference-frequency generation process is theoretically analyzed. The work is fundamentally important to design nonlinear plasmonic nanodevices, especially for efficient and broadband THz emitters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)", "hydrodynamic model", "metasurface", "nonlinear plasmonic nanodevice", "terahertz (THz) emission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Finite -difference time domains (FDTD)", "Hydrodynamic model", "Metasurface", "Plasmonic nanodevice", "Terahertz emissions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047639426", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57201198869": {"Name": "Fang M.", "AuthorID": "57201198869", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "12243904200": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "12243904200", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "55621370600": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "55621370600", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
