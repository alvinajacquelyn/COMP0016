The deposition occurs when wild-type or variant transthyretin becomes unstable and misfolds. Tafamidis binds to transthyretin, preventing tetramer dissociation and amyloidogenesis. METHODS In a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for 30 months. In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations according to the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to month 30 for the 6-minute walk test and the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS), in which higher scores indicate better health status. RESULTS In the primary analysis, all-cause mortality and rates of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations were lower among the 264 patients who received tafamidis than among the 177 patients who received placebo (P<0.001). Tafamidis was associated with lower all-cause mortality than placebo (78 of 264 [29.5%] vs. 76 of 177 [42.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96) and a lower rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, with a relative risk ratio of 0.68 (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81). At month 30, tafamidis was also associated with a lower rate of decline in distance for the 6-minute walk test (P<0.001) and a lower rate of decline in KCCQ-OS score (P<0.001). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, tafamidis was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and reduced the decline in functional capacity and quality of life as compared with placebo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Benzoxazoles", "Cardiomyopathies", "Disease Progression", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prealbumin", "Quality of Life", "Survival Analysis", "Walk Test"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053189041", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"35515053700": {"Name": "Maurer M.S.", "AuthorID": "35515053700", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina"}, "55362112100": {"Name": "Schwartz J.H.", "AuthorID": "55362112100", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "57203899484": {"Name": "Huber P.", "AuthorID": "57203899484", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "57201406837": {"Name": "Schumacher J.", "AuthorID": "57201406837", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "26632723100": {"Name": "Sultan M.B.", "AuthorID": "26632723100", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "55362260600": {"Name": "Gundapaneni B.", "AuthorID": "55362260600", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "Amyloidosis Center, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "University College London, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7006059649": {"Name": "Merlini G.", "AuthorID": "7006059649", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic"}, "7005883289": {"Name": "Rapezzi C.", "AuthorID": "7005883289", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna"}, "16733863700": {"Name": "Waddington-Cruz M.", "AuthorID": "16733863700", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Amyloidosis Center (CEPARM), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "7801324099": {"Name": "Kristen A.V.", "AuthorID": "7801324099", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Amyloidosis Center, Medical University of Heidelberg"}, "7004085182": {"Name": "Grogan M.", "AuthorID": "7004085182", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic"}, "6506863794": {"Name": "Witteles R.", "AuthorID": "6506863794", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "6506337417": {"Name": "Damy T.", "AuthorID": "6506337417", "AffiliationID": "60023970, 60106700, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "French Referral Center for Cardiac Amyloidosis, Amyloidosis Mondor Network, GRC Amyloid Research Institute, Department of Cardiology, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, CHU Henri Mondor, INSERM Unit\u00e9 955, Clinical Investigation Center 006, DHU ATVB"}, "6603536352": {"Name": "Drachman B.M.", "AuthorID": "6603536352", "AffiliationID": "60138419, 60023009", "AffiliationName": "Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, University of Pennsylvania Health System"}, "12545068000": {"Name": "Shah S.J.", "AuthorID": "12545068000", "AffiliationID": "60013227, 60007363", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"}, "23974334100": {"Name": "Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "23974334100", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina"}, "7006780383": {"Name": "Judge D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006780383", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina"}, "57217426476": {"Name": "Patterson T.A.", "AuthorID": "57217426476", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "34767462000": {"Name": "Riley S.", "AuthorID": "34767462000", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "56540593600": {"Name": "Stewart M.", "AuthorID": "56540593600", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "12902676000": {"Name": "Barsdorf A.I.", "AuthorID": "12902676000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
