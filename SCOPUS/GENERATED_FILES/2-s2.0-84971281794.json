Only a few mechanisms have been demonstrated to enhance the kinetics by other means. In this work, the rate constant of the reduction of oxidized porphyrin dye is enhanced by attaching non-conjugated carbazole triphenylamine moiety using iodine/triiodide and tris(2,2\u2032-bispyridinium)cobalt II/III electrolytes. These results are obtained using transient absorption spectroscopy by selectively probing the regeneration kinetics at the porphyrin radical cation and the carbazole triphenylamine radical cation absorption wavelengths. The enhancement in the reduction kinetics is not attributed to changes in the driving force, but to the more exposed dye cation radical orbitals of the dichromophoric dye. The results are important for the development of high efficiency photo-electrochemical devices with minimalized energy loss at electron transfer interfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption wavelengths", "Free-energy difference", "Oxidation potentials", "Photo-electrochemical device", "Reduction kinetics", "Semi-conductor surfaces", "Transient absorption spectroscopies", "Triphenylamine moiety"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971281794", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56441862500": {"Name": "Zhao L.", "AuthorID": "56441862500", "AffiliationID": "60011664, 60189126", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong"}, "57192892894": {"Name": "Wagner P.", "AuthorID": "57192892894", "AffiliationID": "60011664, 60189126", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong"}, "7202914994": {"Name": "Clarke T.M.", "AuthorID": "7202914994", "AffiliationID": "60011664, 60189126", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong"}, "8557588100": {"Name": "Mozer A.J.", "AuthorID": "8557588100", "AffiliationID": "60011664, 60189126", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong"}, "55343421100": {"Name": "Barnsley J.E.", "AuthorID": "55343421100", "AffiliationID": "60017311, 60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, University of Otago"}, "7202357498": {"Name": "Gordon K.C.", "AuthorID": "7202357498", "AffiliationID": "60017311, 60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, University of Otago"}, "16053231100": {"Name": "Mori S.", "AuthorID": "16053231100", "AffiliationID": "60031955", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemistry and Materials, Faculty of Textile Science and Technology, Shinshu University"}}}
