We aimed to evaluate outcomes in patients who had, or had not received MP, along with standard therapy for remission induction in severe AAV. Methods: We retrospectively studied 114 consecutive patients from five centres in Europe and the United States with a new diagnosis of severe AAV (creatinine > 500 \u03bcmol/L or dialysis dependency) and that received standard therapy (plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and high-dose oral corticosteroids) for remission induction with or without pulse MP between 2000 and 2013. We evaluated survival, renal recovery, relapses, and adverse events over the first 12 months. Results: Fifty-two patients received pulse MP in addition to standard therapy compared to 62 patients that did not. There was no difference in survival, renal recovery or relapses. Treatment with MP associated with higher risk of infection during the first 3 months (hazard ratio (HR) 2.7, 95%CI [1.4-5.3], p = 0.004) and higher incidence of diabetes (HR 6.33 [1.94-20.63], p = 0.002), after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that addition of pulse intravenous MP to standard therapy for remission induction in severe AAV may not confer clinical benefit and may be associated with more episodes of infection and higher incidence of diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANCA", "Diabetes mellitus", "Infection", "Methylprednisolone", "Vasculitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infections", "Kidney Function Tests", "Male", "Methylprednisolone", "Middle Aged", "Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care", "Plasma Exchange", "Pulse Therapy, Drug", "Remission Induction", "Renal Dialysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061863646", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"26634709800": {"Name": "Chanouzas D.", "AuthorID": "26634709800", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8266079100": {"Name": "Morgan M.D.", "AuthorID": "8266079100", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195326404": {"Name": "Harper L.", "AuthorID": "57195326404", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005924596": {"Name": "Nightingale P.", "AuthorID": "7005924596", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56670823300": {"Name": "Dale J.A.", "AuthorID": "56670823300", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26429559200": {"Name": "McGregor J.A.G.", "AuthorID": "26429559200", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina Kidney Center"}, "55623951500": {"Name": "Poulton C.J.", "AuthorID": "55623951500", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina Kidney Center"}, "6603139875": {"Name": "Pendergraft W.F.", "AuthorID": "6603139875", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina Kidney Center"}, "35582802800": {"Name": "Hogan S.L.", "AuthorID": "35582802800", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina Kidney Center"}, "55366513900": {"Name": "Salama A.D.", "AuthorID": "55366513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "56346259400": {"Name": "Draibe J.B.", "AuthorID": "56346259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "57206697672": {"Name": "Lee K.", "AuthorID": "57206697672", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "6603562247": {"Name": "Szpirt W.M.", "AuthorID": "6603562247", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "6506244803": {"Name": "Krarup E.", "AuthorID": "6506244803", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "7003554932": {"Name": "Egfjord M.", "AuthorID": "7003554932", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "22978221200": {"Name": "Basu N.", "AuthorID": "22978221200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow"}, "36154366600": {"Name": "Dospinescu P.", "AuthorID": "36154366600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow"}}}
