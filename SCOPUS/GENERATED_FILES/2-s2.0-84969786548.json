An originally tailored and integrated mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to optimise the crude transfer through swing pipelines and equipment utilisation in each GOSP, to minimise the operating costs of a network of GOSPs. The developed model is applied to an existing network of GOSPs in the Ghawar field, Saudi Arabia, by considering 12 different monthly production scenarios developed from real production rates. Compared to rule-based current practice, an average 12.8% cost saving is realised by the developed model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gas oil separation plant", "Mixed integer programming", "Operating expenditures", "Upstream oil and gas industry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current practices", "Gas oil separation plants", "Mixed integer linear programming model", "Mixed integer programming", "Operating expenditures", "Optimal operation", "Surface facilities", "Upstream oil and gas industry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969786548", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"25628253900": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "25628253900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57189367639": {"Name": "Alhasan I.", "AuthorID": "57189367639", "AffiliationID": "116696977", "AffiliationName": "South Ghawar Producing Department"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
