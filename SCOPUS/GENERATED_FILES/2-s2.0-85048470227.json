It is a biomechanically complex articulation comprising the occipital condyles (Oc) the atlas (C1) and axis (C2). Pathologies affecting the CVJ in children are myriad with clinical features resulting from biomechanical instability, deformity, or neuraxial compression. Establishing the natural history and clinical burden of a condition is challenging in infants and young children, often complicated by co-existing neuromuscular and cognitive impairment. This makes investigation and treatment planning difficult. Each disease entity has a predilection for a particular biomechanical abnormality. Investigation using dynamic imaging is most appropriate in instability, computed tomography examination in abnormalities of deformity and magnetic resonance imaging examination in neuraxial compression. Treatment comprises reduction and immobilisation of instability, re-alignment of deformity, or decompression of the neuraxis. We present a review of disease entities affecting the CVJ in children categorised according to a simple mechanistic approach to aid investigation and treatment planning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Axis, Cervical Vertebra", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cervical Atlas", "Child", "Down Syndrome", "Humans", "Incidental Findings", "Joint Instability", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Occipital Bone", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Spinal Diseases", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Torsion Abnormality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048470227", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57202470232": {"Name": "Gaunt T.", "AuthorID": "57202470232", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Evelina Children's Hospital"}, "24390956300": {"Name": "Mankad K.", "AuthorID": "24390956300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "23481036600": {"Name": "Calder A.", "AuthorID": "23481036600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57188573086": {"Name": "Talenti G.", "AuthorID": "57188573086", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57197637137": {"Name": "Watson T.A.", "AuthorID": "57197637137", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57202461178": {"Name": "Tan A.P.", "AuthorID": "57202461178", "AffiliationID": "101755800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, National University Hospital"}, "35502054600": {"Name": "Thompson D.", "AuthorID": "35502054600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
