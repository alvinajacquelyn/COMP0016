Methods: Twenty-five participants were recruited from an eating disorder service. Using a within-subjects design, participants performed one of the following tasks for 15 min: the game 'Tetris' (visuospatial), a general knowledge 'Quiz' (verbal), 'Braille' translation (somatic) and 'Sitting Quietly' (control). In total, participants completed each task on three occasions. Results: The visuospatial, verbal and somatic tasks had beneficial effects on all positive and negative indicators, when compared with 'Sitting Quietly'. Visuospatial and somatic tasks were more effective at reducing intrusive imagery than the verbal task. Conclusions: The results suggest that certain engaging activities can help hospitalised patients with eating disorders manage the difficult post-meal period.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affect", "Distraction", "Eating disorders", "Post-meal tasks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006198737", "SubjectAreas": [["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57197217247": {"Name": "Griffiths E.", "AuthorID": "57197217247", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Eating Disorders Service"}, "35181218200": {"Name": "Hawkes N.", "AuthorID": "35181218200", "AffiliationID": "60099553", "AffiliationName": "Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, St Ann's Eating Disorders Service, Barnet"}, "8645244700": {"Name": "Gilbert S.", "AuthorID": "8645244700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}}}
