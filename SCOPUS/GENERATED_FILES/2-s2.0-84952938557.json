Rare, long-term groundwater-level records in the tropics indicate that groundwater recharge occurs disproportionately from heavy rainfalls exceeding a threshold. The ubiquity of this bias in tropical groundwater recharge to intensive precipitation is, however, unknown. By relating available long-term records of stable-isotope ratios of O and H in tropical precipitation (15 sites) to those of local groundwater, we reveal that groundwater recharge in the tropics is near-uniformly (14/15 sites) biased to intensive monthly rainfall, commonly exceeding the \u223c70th intensity decile. Our results suggest that the intensification of precipitation brought about by global warming favours groundwater replenishment in the tropics. Nevertheless, the processes that transmit intensive rainfall to groundwater systems and enhance the resilience of tropical groundwater storage in a warming world, remain unclear.", "AuthorKeywords": ["groundwater", "hydrology", "isotope", "oxygen-18", "rainfall", "recharge", "tropics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ground water recharge", "Groundwater storage", "Groundwater system", "Intensive rainfall", "Oxygen-18", "recharge", "Stable isotope ratios", "Tropical precipitation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952938557", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"54787707200": {"Name": "Jasechko S.", "AuthorID": "54787707200", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Calgary"}, "8106351700": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "8106351700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
