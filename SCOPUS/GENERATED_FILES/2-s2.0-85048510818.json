Evaluating these patents following the geriatric concept of frailty, about one third of hip fracture patients may be categorised as frail with high risk of poor outcomes and prolonged length of stay, one third as not frail, and about one third with an intermediate condition. Due to the high vulnerability, combined with the hip fracture event and surgical repair procedures, a multidisciplinary approach that includes geriatric competencies becomes essential to improve short and long-term outcomes after hip fracture. A key element of an effective process of care is a true co-managed approach that applies quality standards and provides a fast-track pathway of care, minimises the time the patient spends in bed, and reduces postoperative complications by means of standardised procedures. The occurrence of a fragility fracture is the strongest risk factor for a subsequent fracture. Moreover, frail subjects have a further risk of fracture due to high risk of falls \u2212 related to loss of muscle mass, multiple illnesses, impaired balance and weakness. Thus, effective secondary prevention strategies are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality after hip fracture, and they are currently a standard task of orthogeriatric care. Fracture liaison services (FLS) are probably the most efficient way of addressing secondary prevention including the assessment of both bone health and falls risk. Therefore, the optimal management of frail patients with fragility fracture includes both orthogeriatric care and FLS, which are complementary to each other. Orthogeriatric collaboration is also powerful in influencing healthcare policy. British experience as well as that in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, have shown that when two widely disparate specialisms say the same thing, they may achieve a fundamental shift in attitudes and behaviour of both managers and clinicians. Furthermore, a continuous real-time audit, at national level, is a powerful driver for change and better standards of care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-management", "Fall risk", "Fracture liaison service", "Fragility fracture", "Frailty", "Healthcare policy", "Hip fracture", "Orthogeriatrics", "Osteoporosis", "Secondary prevention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Comorbidity", "Delivery of Health Care", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Female", "Frail Elderly", "Health Care Surveys", "Health Services for the Aged", "Health Services Research", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Male", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Patient Care Team", "Policy Making", "Secondary Prevention"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048510818", "SubjectAreas": [["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55198387200": {"Name": "Pioli G.", "AuthorID": "55198387200", "AffiliationID": "60007505", "AffiliationName": "ASMN-IRCCS Hospital, Reggio Emilia"}, "15924925400": {"Name": "Bendini C.", "AuthorID": "15924925400", "AffiliationID": "60007505", "AffiliationName": "ASMN-IRCCS Hospital, Reggio Emilia"}, "6508095378": {"Name": "Pignedoli P.", "AuthorID": "6508095378", "AffiliationID": "60007505", "AffiliationName": "ASMN-IRCCS Hospital, Reggio Emilia"}, "7004441262": {"Name": "Giusti A.", "AuthorID": "7004441262", "AffiliationID": "120830513", "AffiliationName": "Department of locomotor System"}, "7402332452": {"Name": "Marsh D.", "AuthorID": "7402332452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Fragility Fracture Network"}}}
