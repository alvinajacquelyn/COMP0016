Design Nationally representative prospective cohort study. Setting Children born in the UK between 2000 and 2002. Participants 11\u00e2 \u20ac..399 11-year-old singleton children for whom data on all 6 health conditions and sociodemographic information were available (complete cases). Main outcome measures Prevalence, co-occurrence and clustering of 6 common health conditions: wheeze; eczema; long-standing illness (excluding wheeze and eczema); injury; socioemotional difficulties (measured using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) and unfavourable weight (thin/overweight/obese vs normal). Results 42.4% of children had 2 or more adverse health conditions (co-occurrence). Co-occurrence was more common in boys and children from lower income households. Latent class analysis identified 6 classes: \u00e2 \u20ac normative' (57.4%): \u00e2 \u20ac atopic burdened' (14.0%); \u00e2 \u20ac socioemotional burdened' (11.0%); \u00e2 \u20ac unfavourable weight/injury' (7.7%); \u00e2 \u20ac eczema/injury' (6.0%) and \u00e2 \u20ac eczema/unfavourable weight' (3.9%). As with co-occurrence, class membership differed by sociodemographic factors: boys, children of mothers with lower educational attainment and children from lower income households were more likely to be in the \u00e2 \u20ac socioemotional burdened' class. Children of mothers with higher educational attainment were more likely to be in the \u00e2 \u20ac normative' and \u00e2 \u20ac eczema/unfavourable weight' classes. Conclusions Co-occurrence of adverse health conditions at age 11 is common and is associated with adverse socioeconomic circumstances. Holistic, child focused care, particularly in boys and those in lower income groups, may help to prevent and reduce co-occurrence in later childhood and adolescence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood", "Clustering", "Co-occurrence", "Millennium Cohort Study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asthma", "Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Cluster Analysis", "Comorbidity", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Eczema", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Overweight", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999133815", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55868344300": {"Name": "Hesketh K.", "AuthorID": "55868344300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004859466": {"Name": "Bedford H.", "AuthorID": "7004859466", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203073817": {"Name": "Law C.", "AuthorID": "57203073817", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005279868": {"Name": "Hope S.", "AuthorID": "7005279868", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "35972258500": {"Name": "Fagg J.", "AuthorID": "35972258500", "AffiliationID": "101404254", "AffiliationName": "Wandsworth Borough Council"}, "35206359500": {"Name": "Muniz-Terrera G.", "AuthorID": "35206359500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh"}}}
