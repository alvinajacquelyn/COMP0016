An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure high (H) and low (L) tones presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L-) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than a perceptual effect. We had human listeners (15 males, 12 females) continuously report their perception of such sequences and recorded neural activityusingMEG. Duringneutral listening, aclassifier trainedonpatterns of neural activitydistinguishedbetweenperiods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory streaming", "Intention", "MEG", "Multivariate classification", "Perceptual organization", "Stream segregation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Perception", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Intention", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Sound", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043791091", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55830349800": {"Name": "Billig A.J.", "AuthorID": "55830349800", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "57219322603": {"Name": "Davis M.H.", "AuthorID": "57219322603", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7006201100": {"Name": "Carlyon R.P.", "AuthorID": "7006201100", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}}}
