The method employed recordings of connected narratives divided into phrases of 4 to 10 words, presented in babble. After each phrase, the listener identified key words from the phrase from among similar sounding foil words. Nine postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant users carried out 12 hr of training over a 4-week period. Training was carried out at home on tablet computers. The primary outcome measure was sentence recognition in babble. Vowel and consonant identification in speech-shaped noise were also assessed, along with digit span in noise, intended as a measure of some important underlying cognitive abilities. Talkers for speech tests were different from those used in training. To control for procedural learning, the test battery was administered repeatedly prior to training. Performance was assessed immediately after training and again after a further 4 weeks during which no training occurred. Sentence recognition in babble improved significantly after training, with an improvement in speech reception threshold of approximately 2 dB, which was maintained at the 4-week follow-up. There was little evidence of improvement in the other measures. It appears that the method has potential as a clinical intervention. However, the underlying sources of improvement and the extent to which benefits generalize to real-world situations remain to be determined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cochlear implants", "noise", "speech perception", "training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Auditory Perception", "Cochlear Implantation", "Cochlear Implants", "Computer-Assisted Instruction", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Noise", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064925073", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7401860102": {"Name": "Green T.", "AuthorID": "7401860102", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "7101950250": {"Name": "Faulkner A.", "AuthorID": "7101950250", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "7401609413": {"Name": "Rosen S.", "AuthorID": "7401609413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}}}
