This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of LTBI among individuals using homeless hostels in London. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey with outcome follow-up in homeless hostels in London. Our primary outcome was prevalence of LTBI. Recruitment for the study took place between May 2011 and June 2013. To estimate an LTBI prevalence of 10% with 95% CIs between 8% and 13%, we required 500 participants. Results 491/804 (61.1%) individuals agreed to be screened. The prevalence of LTBI was 16.5% (81/491; 95% CI 13.2 to 19.8). In UK-born individuals, a history of incarceration was associated with increased risk of LTBI (OR 3.49; 95% CI 1.10 to 11.04; P=0.018) after adjusting for age, length of time spent homeless and illicit drug use. Of the three subjects who met English treatment guidelines for LTBI at the time of the study, none engaged with services after referral for treatment. Prevalence of past hepatitis B infection was 10.4% (51/489; 95% CI 7.7 to 13.1), and 59.5% (291/489; 95% CI 55.1 to 63.9) of individuals were non-immune. Prevalence of current hepatitis C infection was 10.4% (51/489; 95% CI 7.8 to 13.1). Conclusions This study demonstrates the high prevalence of LTBI in homeless people in London and the associated poor engagement with care. There is a large unmet need for LTBI and hepatitis C infection treatment, and hepatitis B vaccination, in this group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical Epidemiology", "Respiratory Infection", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis C", "HIV Infections", "Homeless Persons", "Humans", "Latent Tuberculosis", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050970707", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57209842885": {"Name": "Aldridge R.W.", "AuthorID": "57209842885", "AffiliationID": "114434400", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Informatics, Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.C.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "57093436600": {"Name": "Hemming S.", "AuthorID": "57093436600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101836785": {"Name": "Yates S.K.", "AuthorID": "7101836785", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57094177100": {"Name": "Ferenando G.", "AuthorID": "57094177100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57094090000": {"Name": "Possas L.", "AuthorID": "57094090000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216019917": {"Name": "Garber E.", "AuthorID": "57216019917", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35398561000": {"Name": "Watson J.M.", "AuthorID": "35398561000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Health Data Science, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57195311478": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "57195311478", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6701366859": {"Name": "Geretti A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701366859", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "Mchugh T.D.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "14623146100": {"Name": "Story A.", "AuthorID": "14623146100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "FindandTreat, University College London Hospitals"}}}
