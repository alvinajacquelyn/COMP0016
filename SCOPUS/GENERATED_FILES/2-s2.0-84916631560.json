The electroactive \u03b2 phase nucleation mechanism and the dielectric properties of the films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and using an LCR meter. Results confirmed that the electroactive \u03b2 phase crystallization in the PVDF matrix is due to the fast nucleating or catalytic effect of the in situ NPs. Homogenous dispersion of in situ Fe2O3-Co3O4 NPs in the polymer matrix leads to strong interfacial interaction between the NPs and the polymer resulting in enhanced \u03b2 phase nucleation in PVDF and a large dielectric constant of the thin films. The observed variation in the electroactive \u03b2 phase nucleation by NPs (Fe2O3-Co3O4) and the dielectric properties of the thin films have been explained on the basis of surface charge, size, geometrical shape and extent of agglomeration of the NPs in the polymer matrix.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916631560", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57219524421": {"Name": "Thakur P.", "AuthorID": "57219524421", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "56248104400": {"Name": "Kool A.", "AuthorID": "56248104400", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "55476996600": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55476996600", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "35547678500": {"Name": "Nandy P.", "AuthorID": "35547678500", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "16456874100": {"Name": "Bagchi B.", "AuthorID": "16456874100", "AffiliationID": "60023083", "AffiliationName": "Fuel Cell and Battery Division, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute"}}}
