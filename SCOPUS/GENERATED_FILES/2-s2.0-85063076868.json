Dual RNA-seq on patient lesions identifies two independent molecular measures of M. leprae, each of which correlates with distinct aspects of the host immune response. The fraction of bacterial transcripts, reflecting bacterial burden, correlates with a host type I IFN gene signature, known to inhibit antimicrobial responses. Second, the bacterial mRNA:rRNA ratio, reflecting bacterial viability, links bacterial heat shock proteins with the BAFF-BCMA host antibody response pathway. Our findings provide a platform for the interrogation of host and pathogen transcriptomes at the site of infection, allowing insight into mechanisms of inflammation in human disease.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsMontoya et al. utilizes dual RNA-seq to define the bacterial burden and transcriptional state within leprosy skin lesions. These molecular measures vary across patients and provide separate but informative metrics about the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease, revealing that the immune system responds to bacterial states and not just their abundance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioinformatics", "computational biology", "heat shock", "host-pathogen", "humoral", "immunology", "microbiology", "mycobacteria", "plasma cell", "sequencing", "systems immunology", "transcriptome", "translational", "tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "B-Cell Activating Factor", "Female", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Immunity, Humoral", "Interferon Type I", "Leprosy", "Male", "Mycobacterium leprae", "Plasma Cells", "RNA, Bacterial", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA, Ribosomal", "RNA-Seq", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063076868", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"12794612800": {"Name": "Montoya D.J.", "AuthorID": "12794612800", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles"}, "57203034762": {"Name": "Ma F.", "AuthorID": "57203034762", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles"}, "57203575524": {"Name": "Noel T.", "AuthorID": "57203575524", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles"}, "57022456500": {"Name": "Lu J.", "AuthorID": "57022456500", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles"}, "7103161935": {"Name": "Pellegrini M.", "AuthorID": "7103161935", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles"}, "55440687200": {"Name": "Andrade P.", "AuthorID": "55440687200", "AffiliationID": "60005247", "AffiliationName": "Division of Dermatology, David Geffen School of Medicine"}, "57189393052": {"Name": "Silva B.J.A.", "AuthorID": "57189393052", "AffiliationID": "60005247", "AffiliationName": "Division of Dermatology, David Geffen School of Medicine"}, "6701468168": {"Name": "Teles R.M.B.", "AuthorID": "6701468168", "AffiliationID": "60005247", "AffiliationName": "Division of Dermatology, David Geffen School of Medicine"}, "7102874029": {"Name": "Modlin R.L.", "AuthorID": "7102874029", "AffiliationID": "60005247", "AffiliationName": "Division of Dermatology, David Geffen School of Medicine"}, "55279534500": {"Name": "Bryson B.", "AuthorID": "55279534500", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.H.
