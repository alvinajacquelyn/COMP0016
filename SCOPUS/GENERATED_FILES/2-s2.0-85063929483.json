Their simple combination usually does not provide an improvement if compared with using the best source alone. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a recent multiple kernel learning algorithm called EasyMKL and we investigated the benefits of this approach for diagnosing two different mental health diseases. The well known Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset tackling the Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients versus healthy controls classification task, and a second dataset tackling the task of classifying an heterogeneous group of depressed patients versus healthy controls. We used EasyMKL to combine a huge amount of basic kernels alongside a feature selection methodology, pursuing an optimal and sparse solution to facilitate interpretability. Our results show that the proposed approach, called EasyMKLFS, outperforms baselines (e.g. SVM and SimpleMKL), state-of-the-art random forests (RF) and feature selection (FS) methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Feature selection", "Multiple kernel learning", "Neuroimaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Depression", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Machine Learning", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063929483", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55977393100": {"Name": "Donini M.", "AuthorID": "55977393100", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "6603887035": {"Name": "Pontil M.", "AuthorID": "6603887035", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57188588235": {"Name": "Monteiro J.", "AuthorID": "57188588235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203998200": {"Name": "Mour\u00e3o-Miranda J.", "AuthorID": "57203998200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003290763": {"Name": "Shawe-Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7003290763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7201384958": {"Name": "Hahn T.", "AuthorID": "7201384958", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "7004260129": {"Name": "Fallgatter A.", "AuthorID": "7004260129", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tuebingen"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
