The existing gold standard diagnosis relies on the culture of bacteria which is a lengthy and costly process, taking up to 45 days. New technologies based on molecular diagnosis have been proposed, either through dip-stick, immunological assays, which have limited specificity, or using nucleic acid tests, which enable to identify the pathogen, but are impractical for use in the field, where most of the reservoir cases are located. Here we demonstrate a new test based on hybridization assays with metal nanoparticles, which, upon detection of a specific pathogen-derived DNA sequence, yield a visual colour change. We characterise the components used in the assay with a range of analytical techniques and show sensitivities down to 1000 cfu/ml for the detection of Brucella. Finally, we demonstrate that the assay works in a range of bovine samples including semen, milk and urine, opening up the potential for its use in the field, in low-resource settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biosensing Techniques", "Brucella", "Cattle", "DNA Probes", "Gold", "Limit of Detection", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Milk", "Nucleic Acid Hybridization", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024477635", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191432756": {"Name": "Pal D.", "AuthorID": "57191432756", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology and Mycology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "57202541730": {"Name": "Kaur G.", "AuthorID": "57202541730", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology and Mycology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "57194978251": {"Name": "Ali S.A.", "AuthorID": "57194978251", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology and Mycology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "35481861000": {"Name": "Chaudhuri P.", "AuthorID": "35481861000", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology and Mycology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "57194975332": {"Name": "Boby N.", "AuthorID": "57194975332", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Animal Biotechnology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "57197068762": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57197068762", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Animal Biotechnology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "15749630700": {"Name": "Shrivastava S.", "AuthorID": "15749630700", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Animal Biotechnology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "7404235540": {"Name": "Gupta P.K.", "AuthorID": "7404235540", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Animal Biotechnology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
