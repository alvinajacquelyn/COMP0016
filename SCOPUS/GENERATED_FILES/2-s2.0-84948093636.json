Three-dimensional motion without symmetry is addressed for arbitrary jet cross-sections and incident velocity profiles. Asymptotic analysis based on the comparatively long axial length scale of the configuration leads to a reduced longitudinal vortex system providing a slender flow model for the complete array response. Analytical and numerical studies, along with comparisons and asymptotic limits or checks, are presented for various cross-sectional shapes of nozzle and velocity inputs. The influences of swirl and of unsteady jets are examined. Substantial cross-flows are found to occur due to the interference. The flow solution is non-periodic in the cross-plane even if the nozzle array itself is periodic. The analysis shows that in general the bulk of the three-dimensional motion can be described simply in a cross-plane problem but the induced flow in the cross-plane is sensitively controlled by edge effects and incident conditions, a feature which applies to any of the array configurations examined. Interference readily alters the cross-flow direction and misdirects the jets. Design considerations centre on target positioning and jet swirling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["air guns", "analysis", "asymptotic theory", "food sorting", "jets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air guns", "analysis", "Asymptotic theories", "Cross-sectional shape", "Longitudinal vortices", "Theoretical investigations", "Three dimensional arrays", "Three-dimensional motion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948093636", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56496816600": {"Name": "Westwood P.E.", "AuthorID": "56496816600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, UCL"}, "57203583662": {"Name": "Smith F.T.", "AuthorID": "57203583662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, UCL"}}}
