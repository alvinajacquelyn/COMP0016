The underlying machinery remains enigmatic, mainly because the sponge-like astrocyte morphology has been difficult to access experimentally or explore theoretically. Here, we systematically incorporate multi-scale, tri-dimensional astroglial architecture into a realistic multi-compartmental cell model, which we constrain by empirical tests and integrate into the NEURON computational biophysical environment. This approach is implemented as a flexible astrocyte-model builder ASTRO. As a proof-of-concept, we explore an in silico astrocyte to evaluate basic cell physiology features inaccessible experimentally. Our simulations suggest that currents generated by glutamate transporters or K+ channels have negligible distant effects on membrane voltage and that individual astrocytes can successfully handle extracellular K+ hotspots. We show how intracellular Ca2+ buffers affect Ca2+ waves and why the classical Ca2+ sparks-and-puffs mechanism is theoretically compatible with common readouts of astroglial Ca2+ imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Amino Acid Transport System X-AG", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Calcium", "Computer Simulation", "Hippocampus", "Membrane Potentials", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Potassium Channels", "Proof of Concept Study", "Rats", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052752585", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603433779": {"Name": "Savtchenko L.", "AuthorID": "6603433779", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "24342887300": {"Name": "Bard L.", "AuthorID": "24342887300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7401539602": {"Name": "Jensen T.", "AuthorID": "7401539602", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56915216400": {"Name": "Reynolds J.", "AuthorID": "56915216400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "8694890100": {"Name": "Henneberger C.", "AuthorID": "8694890100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center of Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "8775592800": {"Name": "Kraev I.", "AuthorID": "8775592800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}, "8973577000": {"Name": "Medvedev N.", "AuthorID": "8973577000", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}, "57193373270": {"Name": "Stewart M.", "AuthorID": "57193373270", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences, University of Bonn"}}}
