This article focuses on the most important aspects of how to perform T2* imaging, from acquisition, to postprocessing, to analyzing the data with clinical concentration. Newer techniques have made T2* mapping more robust and accurate, allowing a broader use of this technique for noncontrast ischemia imaging based on blood oxygen levels, in addition to evaluation of intramyocardial hemorrhage and microvascular obstruction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)", "Hemorrhage", "Iron overload", "Parametric mapping", "T2*"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Iron Overload", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068215447", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57199864257": {"Name": "Menacho K.", "AuthorID": "57199864257", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, The Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "The Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit, The Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "8336175400": {"Name": "Fernandes J.L.", "AuthorID": "8336175400", "AffiliationID": "114176715", "AffiliationName": "Jose Michel Kalaf Research Institute, Radiologia Clinica de Campinas"}}}
