We reapply the state of the art methodology by comparing optimal results of Dynamic Programming (DP) against a real-time control candidate. After careful selection, we opted for an Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) based approach for the following reasons: (i) results are quite remarkable with less than 5% fuel usage increase when compared to DP; (ii) simple and intuitive tuning of control parameters; (iii) readily usable for code generation (prototyping). Topics that distinguish this article from others in the literature include: (i) the usage of trapezoidal rule of integration implementing DP and ECMS; consequently, the offline simulation results are intended to be more precise and representative when compared against the more common, often used rectangular rule; (ii) a particular post-processing procedure of the recorded driving cycle data based on physical interpretation; it allows consistent offline simulations with quite high sampling period (in the order of seconds); (iii) tuning of control parameters in such a way that control system is robust towards new, unknown, unpredictable but closely resembling driving cycles. In particular, we focus on the supervisory control of a forklift truck. The real-time control is able to compute: (i) the power split (i.e. a balanced usage between an internal combustion engine and a supercapacitor); (ii) the drivetrain control (i.e. automatic gear shifting and clutching). Numerous numerical implementation issues are discussed along our presentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["automotive application", "dynamic programming", "energy management", "hybrid electric vehicles", "real-time control", "supervisory control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automotive applications", "Equivalent consumption minimization strategies (ECMS)", "Numerical implementation", "Off-line simulations", "Parallel hybrid electric vehicles", "Physical interpretation", "Post-processing procedure", "Supervisory control"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040626327", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"36456272000": {"Name": "Teodorescu C.", "AuthorID": "36456272000", "AffiliationID": "60007631", "AffiliationName": "Flanders Make"}, "57188723022": {"Name": "Vandenplas S.", "AuthorID": "57188723022", "AffiliationID": "60007631", "AffiliationName": "Flanders Make"}, "36106852800": {"Name": "Depraetere B.", "AuthorID": "36106852800", "AffiliationID": "60007631", "AffiliationName": "Flanders Make"}, "55037441500": {"Name": "Shariatmadar K.", "AuthorID": "55037441500", "AffiliationID": "120087965", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Engineering, Dana - Belgium NV"}, "14632856400": {"Name": "Vyncke T.", "AuthorID": "14632856400", "AffiliationID": "120087965", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Engineering, Dana - Belgium NV"}, "6701509229": {"Name": "Duflou J.", "AuthorID": "6701509229", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
