However, small-molecule approaches for inducing lineage-specific stem cells from somatic cells across lineage boundaries have been challenging. Here, we report highly efficient reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced neural stem cell-like cells (ciNSLCs) using a cocktail of nine components (M9). The resulting ciNSLCs closely resemble primary neural stem cells molecularly and functionally. Transcriptome analysis revealed that M9 induces a gradual and specific conversion of fibroblasts toward a neural fate. During reprogramming specific transcription factors such as Elk1 and Gli2 that are downstream of M9-induced signaling pathways bind and activate endogenous master neural genes to specify neural identity. Our study provides an effective chemical approach for generating neural stem cells from mouse fibroblasts and reveals mechanistic insights into underlying reprogramming processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Culture Media", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Fibroblast Growth Factor 2", "Fibroblasts", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Mice", "Multipotent Stem Cells", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Signal Transduction", "Transcriptional Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964607330", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57212870521": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "57212870521", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco"}, "13610375800": {"Name": "Zhu S.", "AuthorID": "13610375800", "AffiliationID": "60117862, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Life Sciences Institute, Zhejiang University"}, "56225052100": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "56225052100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco"}, "50961014400": {"Name": "Cao N.", "AuthorID": "50961014400", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57109563300": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "57109563300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco"}, "21833396700": {"Name": "Ding S.", "AuthorID": "21833396700", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57196143675": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "57196143675", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57188998947": {"Name": "Lin Y.", "AuthorID": "57188998947", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco"}, "55627685400": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "55627685400", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "7403974879": {"Name": "Zheng J.", "AuthorID": "7403974879", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco"}}}
