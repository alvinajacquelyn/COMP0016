The differentiated cells (dADSCs) underwent self-alignment in a tethered type-1 collagen gel, followed by stabilisation to generate engineered neural tissue (EngNT-dADSC). The pro-regenerative phenotype of dADSCs was enhanced by this process, and the columns of aligned dADSCs in the aligned collagen matrix supported and guided neurite extension invitro. EngNT-dADSC sheets were rolled to form peripheral nerve repair constructs that were implanted within NeuraWrap conduits to bridge a 15mm gap in rat sciatic nerve. After 8 weeks regeneration was assessed using immunofluorescence imaging and transmission electron microscopy and compared to empty conduit and nerve graft controls. The proportion of axons detected in the distal stump was 3.5 fold greater in constructs containing EngNT-dADSC than empty tube controls. Our novel combination of technologies that can organise autologous therapeutic cells within an artificial tissue construct provides a promising new cellular biomaterial for peripheral nerve repair.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipose-derived stem cell", "Collagen", "Nerve guide", "Nerve regeneration", "Nerve tissue engineering", "Stem cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose derived stem cells", "Critical sized defects", "Differentiated cells", "Nerve guide", "Nerve regeneration", "Nerve tissue engineering", "Peripheral nerve regeneration", "Peripheral nerve repair", "Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Nerve Regeneration", "Nerve Tissue", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Schwann Cells", "Sciatic Nerve", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922221118", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"55212954600": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "55212954600", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "7201440347": {"Name": "Golding J.", "AuthorID": "7201440347", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "6603680474": {"Name": "Loughlin A.", "AuthorID": "6603680474", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "6602475625": {"Name": "Kingham P.", "AuthorID": "6602475625", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Medical Biology, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
