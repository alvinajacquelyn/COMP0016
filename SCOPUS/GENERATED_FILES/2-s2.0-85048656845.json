Owing to the requirement for many plasmonic devices to operate at elevated temperatures however, it is essential to characterize the degradation of these properties upon heating. Here, SrMoO3 thin films are annealed in air at temperatures ranging from 75-500\u00b0 C. Characterizations by AFM, XRD, and spectroscopic ellipsometry after each anneal identify a loss of metallic behaviour after annealing at 500\u00b0 C, together with the underlying mechanism. Moreover, it is shown that by annealing the films in nitrogen following deposition, an additional crystalline phase of SrMoO4 is induced at the film's surface, which suppresses oxidation at elevated temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystalline phase", "Elevated temperature", "Local heating", "Metallic behaviour", "Plasmonic devices", "Strontium molybdate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048656845", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"57195928921": {"Name": "Wells M.", "AuthorID": "57195928921", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "55684455300": {"Name": "Zou B.", "AuthorID": "55684455300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "23976418900": {"Name": "Mihai A.", "AuthorID": "23976418900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "57202442148": {"Name": "Bower R.", "AuthorID": "57202442148", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "7004543943": {"Name": "Fearn S.", "AuthorID": "7004543943", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "57202676792": {"Name": "Alford N.", "AuthorID": "57202676792", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "18837833200": {"Name": "Petrov P.", "AuthorID": "18837833200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Materials"}, "57195573241": {"Name": "Doiron B.", "AuthorID": "57195573241", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Physics"}, "7201635833": {"Name": "Maier S.", "AuthorID": "7201635833", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Faculty of Physics"}}}
