The estimates use a one-sided Lipschitz stability (Lip+-stability) estimate on the discrete solution and are obtained in a weak norm, but thanks to a total variation a priori bound on the discrete solution and an interpolation inequality, error estimates in Lp-norms (1\u2264 p ;lt& \u221e) are deduced. Both first-order artificial viscosity and a nonlinear shock capturing term that formally is of second order are considered. For the discretization in time we use the forward Euler method. In the numerical section we verify the convergence order of the nonlinear scheme using the forward Euler method and a second-order strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta method. We also study the Lip+-stability property numerically and give some examples of when it holds strictly and when it is violated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burgers' equation", "error estimates", "shock capturing", "stabilized finite element method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Burgers' equations", "Error estimates", "Finite element approximations", "Interpolation inequality", "Shock-capturing", "Shock-capturing terms", "Stabilized finite element methods", "Strong stability preserving runge-kutta methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953867895", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
