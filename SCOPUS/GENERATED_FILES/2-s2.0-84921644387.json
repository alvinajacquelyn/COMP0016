We illustrate how a life course approach has been applied to cardiovascular disease, highlighting the evidence in support of the early origins of disease risk. We summarize how trajectories of cardiometabolic risk factors change over the life course and suggest that understanding underlying 'normal' or 'healthy' trajectories and the characteristics that drive deviations from such trajectories offer the potential for early prevention and for identifying means of preventing future disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adiposity", "birth weight", "blood pressure", "cardiovascular disease", "cohort studies", "glucose", "life course", "lipids", "longitudinal modeling", "social inequalities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aging", "Birth Weight", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Pressure", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Child", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Lipids", "Menopause", "Pregnancy", "Puberty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921644387", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing"}, "7102452820": {"Name": "Lawlor D.A.", "AuthorID": "7102452820", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}}}
