All rights reserved.Theta frequency oscillations in the 6- to 10-Hz range dominate the rodent hippocampal local field potential during translational movement, suggesting that theta encodes self-motion. Increases in theta power have also been identified in the human hippocampus during both real and virtual movement but appear as transient bursts in distinct high- and low-frequency bands, and it is not yet clear how these bursts relate to the sustained oscillation observed in rodents. Here, we examine depth electrode recordings from the temporal lobe of 13 presurgical epilepsy patients performing a self-paced spatial memory task in a virtual environment. In contrast to previous studies, we focus on movement-onset periods that incorporate both initial acceleration and an immediately preceding stationary interval associated with prominent theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampal formation. We demonstrate that movement-onset periods are associated with a significant increase in both low (2\u20135 Hz)- and high (6\u20139 Hz)-frequency theta power in the human hippocampus. Similar increases in low- and high-frequency theta power are seen across lateral temporal lobe recording sites and persist throughout the remainder of movement in both regions. In addition, we show that movement-related theta power is greater both before and during longer paths, directly implicating human hippocampal theta in the encoding of translational movement. These findings strengthen the connection between studies of theta-band activity in rodents and humans and offer additional insight into the neural mechanisms of spatial navigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "Intracranial EEG", "Navigation", "Spatial memory", "Theta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amygdala", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Movement", "Spatial Memory", "Spatial Navigation", "Temporal Lobe", "Theta Rhythm", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033694086", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56273570100": {"Name": "Bush D.", "AuthorID": "56273570100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26031311300": {"Name": "Bisby J.A.", "AuthorID": "26031311300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "48261049300": {"Name": "Gollwitzer S.", "AuthorID": "48261049300", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Erlangen"}, "35307885500": {"Name": "Rodionov R.", "AuthorID": "35307885500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.C.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7201921957": {"Name": "Bird C.M.", "AuthorID": "7201921957", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}}}
