Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by parietal, occipital and occipito-temporal tissue loss and progressive impairment of higher-order visual function in contrast to relatively spared memory and language. Targeted types of locomotion were walking in a series of corridors, up or down stairs, and across an open room with or without the presence of an obstacle. Eye tracking measures and inertial moment units (IMU) were used in this experiment, and resultant acceleration of left foot and fixation duration were extracted. Findings from three participants are presented as a case series: one control, one PCA and one tAD patient. The averaged resultant acceleration of PCA patient was the slowest in all types of locomotion, especially in stairs. The averaged resultant accelerations of PCA and tAD participants were slower than the control participant. The PCA participant had longer mean fixation durations than the tAD and control participants, however, mean fixation duration was similar between tAD and control participants. Results may help characterise locomotion and eye behaviour in PCA and tAD and may suggest ways to support effective diagnosis and assessment of disease progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Disease Progression", "Environment, Controlled", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Occipital Lobe", "Parietal Lobe", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953239185", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"14012223300": {"Name": "Suzuki T.", "AuthorID": "14012223300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "57037415400": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "57037415400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "7004965556": {"Name": "McCarthy I.", "AuthorID": "7004965556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "57039002600": {"Name": "Papadosifos N.", "AuthorID": "57039002600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "56656649100": {"Name": "Boampong D.", "AuthorID": "56656649100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "7101643482": {"Name": "Holloway C.", "AuthorID": "7101643482", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "7006815425": {"Name": "Tyler N.", "AuthorID": "7006815425", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Enginnering, University College London"}, "55650633000": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "55650633000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56638016800": {"Name": "Carton A.", "AuthorID": "56638016800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
