These narratives are rooted in historical ways in which feminists have discursively articulated sexual violence, yet are shaped by distinctive \u201cplatform vernacular\u201d or the conventions, affordances, and restrictions of the platforms in which they appear. Drawing on a qualitative content and critical discourse analysis of 450 texts from the Tumblr site Who Needs Feminism? and the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, we argue that digital platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter produce new vernacular practices which shape how \u201cdigitized narratives\u201d of sexual violence are not only disclosed and known, but felt and experienced across digital networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digitized narratives", "feminism", "memes", "platform vernacular", "rape", "rape culture", "sexual violence", "Tumblr", "Twitter"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059510242", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"26327001900": {"Name": "Mendes K.", "AuthorID": "26327001900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "37067584500": {"Name": "Keller J.", "AuthorID": "37067584500", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "18042366600": {"Name": "Ringrose J.", "AuthorID": "18042366600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
