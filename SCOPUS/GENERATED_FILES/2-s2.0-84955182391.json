Methods There were 1263 participants aged 50-74 years from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing with data on working status and work-related psychosocial factors at baseline (wave 2; 2004-2005), and working status at follow-up (wave 5; 2010-2011). Psychosocial factors at work were assessed using a short validated version of ERI and job control. An allostatic load index was formed using 13 biological parameters. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Exit from the labour market was defined as not working in the labour market when 61 years old or younger in 2010-2011. Results Higher ERI OR=1.62 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.61, p=0.048) predicted exit from the labour market independent of age, sex, education, occupational class, allostatic load and depression. Job control OR=0.60 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.85, p=0.004) was associated with exit from the labour market independent of age, sex, education, occupation and depression. The association of higher effort OR=1.32 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.73, p=0.045) with exit from the labour market was independent of age, sex and depression but attenuated to nonsignificance when additionally controlling for socioeconomic measures. Reward was not related to exit from the labour market. Conclusions Stressful work conditions can be a risk for exiting the labour market before the age of 61 years. Neither socioeconomic position nor allostatic load and depressive symptoms seem to explain this association.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Distribution", "Aged", "Allostasis", "Depression", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Internal-External Control", "Logistic Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organizational Culture", "Prospective Studies", "Retirement", "Reward", "Sex Distribution", "Social Environment", "Stress, Psychological", "Workplace"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955182391", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55921083600": {"Name": "Hintsa T.", "AuthorID": "55921083600", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Science, University of Helsinki"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Science, University of Helsinki"}, "7003614400": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "7003614400", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57207502654": {"Name": "Kouvonen A.", "AuthorID": "57207502654", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health (Northern Ireland), Queen's University Belfast"}, "57213987952": {"Name": "McCann M.", "AuthorID": "57213987952", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"}, "6505997583": {"Name": "Demakakos P.", "AuthorID": "6505997583", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
