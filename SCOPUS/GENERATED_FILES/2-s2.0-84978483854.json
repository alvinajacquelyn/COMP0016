In this study we determined the effect of oscillation in pressure and temperature on a phase transformation using the Gibbs droplet model in a generic format. The developed model is valid for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium clusters formed through a stationary or non-stationary process. We validated the underlying model by comparing the predicted kinetics of water droplet formation from the gas phase against experimental data in the absence of ultrasound. Our results demonstrated better agreement with experimental data in comparison with classical nucleation theory. Then, we determined the thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleation and the early stage of growth of clusters in an isothermal sonocrystallisation process. This new contribution shows that the effect of pressure on the kinetics of nucleation is cluster size-dependent in contrast to classical nucleation theory.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical nucleation theory", "Effect of pressure", "High intensity ultrasounds", "Kinetics of nucleation", "Metastable phase", "Nonstationary process", "Pressure and temperature", "Thermodynamics and kinetics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978483854", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56502176900": {"Name": "Haqshenas S.", "AuthorID": "56502176900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603625764": {"Name": "Saffari N.", "AuthorID": "6603625764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203260116": {"Name": "Ford I.", "AuthorID": "57203260116", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
