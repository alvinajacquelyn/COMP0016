In this report, data from 73,802 images taken by 15 different Penguin Watch cameras are presented, capturing the dynamics of penguin (Spheniscidae; Pygoscelis spp.) breeding colonies across the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Islands and South Georgia (03/2012 to 01/2014). Citizen science provides a means by which large and otherwise intractable photographic data sets can be processed, and here we describe the methodology associated with the Zooniverse project Penguin Watch, and provide validation of the method. We present anonymised volunteer classifications for the 73,802 images, alongside the associated metadata (including date/time and temperature information). In addition to the benefits for ecological monitoring, such as easy detection of animal attendance patterns, this type of annotated time-lapse imagery can be employed as a training tool for machine learning algorithms to automate data extraction, and we encourage the use of this data set for computer vision development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antarctic Regions", "Ecological Parameter Monitoring", "Population Dynamics", "Spheniscidae", "Time-Lapse Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049201307", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57190682196": {"Name": "Jones F.M.", "AuthorID": "57190682196", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "56478188600": {"Name": "Black C.", "AuthorID": "56478188600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "25521692600": {"Name": "Hart T.", "AuthorID": "25521692600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "57194688499": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "57194688499", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "57202748023": {"Name": "Arthur J.", "AuthorID": "57202748023", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "35208385300": {"Name": "Hines G.", "AuthorID": "35208385300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "8426623500": {"Name": "Lintott C.J.", "AuthorID": "8426623500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "57202747165": {"Name": "Machkov Z.", "AuthorID": "57202747165", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "36161974600": {"Name": "Miller G.", "AuthorID": "36161974600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "57202738550": {"Name": "Torsey H.R.", "AuthorID": "57202738550", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "8426090200": {"Name": "Arteta C.", "AuthorID": "8426090200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "7006619672": {"Name": "Zisserman A.", "AuthorID": "7006619672", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "7801514534": {"Name": "Emmerson L.M.", "AuthorID": "7801514534", "AffiliationID": "60019943", "AffiliationName": "Department of the Environment and Energy, Australian Antarctic Division"}, "6701777858": {"Name": "Southwell C.", "AuthorID": "6701777858", "AffiliationID": "60019943", "AffiliationName": "Department of the Environment and Energy, Australian Antarctic Division"}, "57206996477": {"Name": "Freeman R.", "AuthorID": "57206996477", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Wellcome Building, Outer Circle"}, "7403403296": {"Name": "Simpson R.", "AuthorID": "7403403296", "AffiliationID": "60111167", "AffiliationName": "Google UK, Belgrave House"}}}
