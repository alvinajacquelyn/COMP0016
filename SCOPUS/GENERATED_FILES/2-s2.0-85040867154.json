Objective: This study used a multi-modal neuroimaging approach to investigate early structural changes during spontaneous recovery from VS/UWS to MCS. Methods: The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score, 24-h electroencephalography (EEG), and ultra-high field 7-T magnetic resonance imaging were used to investigate a male patient with severe brain injury when he was in VS/UWS compared to MCS. Using white matter connectometry analysis, fibers in MCS were compared with the same fibers in VS/UWS. Whole-brain analysis was used to compare all fibers showing a 10% increase in density with each other as a population. Results: Based on connectometry analysis, the number of fibers with increased density, and the magnitude of increase in MCS compared to VS/UWS, was greatest in the area of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and was mostly located in the right hemisphere. These results are in accordance with the active areas observed on 24-h EEG recordings. Moreover, analysis of different fibers across the brain, showing at least a 10% increase in density, revealed that altered white matter connections with higher discriminative weights were located within or across visual-related areas, including the cuneus_R, calcarine_R, occipital_sup_R, and occipital_mid_R. Furthermore, the temporal_mid_R, which is related to the auditory cortex, showed the highest increase in connectivity to other areas. This was consistent with improvements in the visual and auditory components of the CRS-R, which were greater than other improvements. Conclusion: These results provide evidence to support the important roles for the TPJ and the visual and auditory sensory systems in the early recovery of a patient with severe brain injury. Our findings may facilitate a much deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying conscious-related processes and enlighten treatment strategies for patients with DOC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cuneus", "Disorders of consciousness", "Recovery", "Structural changes", "Temporoparietal junction", "Ultra-high field (7 T)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040867154", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57200328841": {"Name": "Tan X.", "AuthorID": "57200328841", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Brain Medical Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "56688124900": {"Name": "Wei R.", "AuthorID": "56688124900", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Brain Medical Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "55334460900": {"Name": "He F.", "AuthorID": "55334460900", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Brain Medical Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "57200328241": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57200328241", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Brain Medical Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "7202607219": {"Name": "Luo B.", "AuthorID": "7202607219", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science"}, "55702625600": {"Name": "Gao J.", "AuthorID": "55702625600", "AffiliationID": "116472107", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Hangzhou Hospital of Zhejiang CAPR"}, "57202084382": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57202084382", "AffiliationID": "116472107", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Hangzhou Hospital of Zhejiang CAPR"}, "57200328133": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "57200328133", "AffiliationID": "116472107", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Hangzhou Hospital of Zhejiang CAPR"}, "57189993311": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57189993311", "AffiliationID": "116472107", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Hangzhou Hospital of Zhejiang CAPR"}, "57194086444": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57194086444", "AffiliationID": "60118080, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University"}, "35254246400": {"Name": "Pan G.", "AuthorID": "35254246400", "AffiliationID": "60118080, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University"}, "57206855061": {"Name": "Gong T.", "AuthorID": "57206855061", "AffiliationID": "60117749, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Imaging Science and Techonology, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrumental Science, Zhejiang University"}, "55246110900": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "55246110900", "AffiliationID": "60117861, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Technology, Qiushi Academy for Advanced Studies, Zhejiang University"}}}
