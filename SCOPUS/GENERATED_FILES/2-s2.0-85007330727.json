The vast majority of these tests, however, are exclusively designed for cases when the sample size n is larger than the dimension of the variable p, and the null distributions of their test statistics are usually derived under the asymptotic case when p is fixed and n increases. In this article, a test that utilizes principal components to test for nonnormality is proposed for cases when p/n \u2192 c. The power and size of the test are examined through Monte Carlo simulations, and it is argued that the test remains well behaved and consistent against most nonnormal distributions under this type of asymptotics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Increasing dimension", "Nonnormality", "Principal components"], "IndexKeywords": ["High dimensional data", "Increasing dimension", "Non-normal distribution", "Non-normality", "Null distribution", "Principal Components", "Sample sizes", "Test statistics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007330727", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"57201775273": {"Name": "Mansoor R.", "AuthorID": "57201775273", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health Sciences, University of Dundee"}}}
