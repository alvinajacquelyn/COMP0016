All rights reserved.The interaction of energetic ions with solids results in energy loss to both atomic nuclei and electrons in the solid. In this article, recent advances in understanding and modeling the additive and competitive effects of nuclear and electronic energy loss on the response of materials to ion irradiation are reviewed. Experimental methods and large-scale atomistic simulations are used to study the separate and combined effects of nuclear and electronic energy loss on ion beam modification of materials. The results demonstrate that nuclear and electronic energy loss can lead to additive effects on irradiation damage production in some materials; while in other materials, the competitive effects of electronic energy loss leads to recovery of damage induced by elastic collision cascades. These results have significant implications for ion beam modification of materials, non-thermal recovery of ion implantation damage, and the response of materials to extreme radiation environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic/nuclear energy loss", "Ion annealing", "Irradiation effects", "Synergistic effects", "Thermal spike model", "Two-temperature model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic simulations", "Electronic energy loss", "Irradiation effect", "Nuclear and electronic energy loss", "Radiation environments", "Synergistic effect", "Thermal spike model", "Two Temperature Model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922964443", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7402748291": {"Name": "Weber W.J.", "AuthorID": "7402748291", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "55153293800": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55153293800", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "7101657971": {"Name": "Duffy D.M.", "AuthorID": "7101657971", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7005650546": {"Name": "Thom\u00e9 L.", "AuthorID": "7005650546", "AffiliationID": "60068544, 60106017, 60000383", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Sciences Nucl\u00e9aires et de Sciences de la Mati\u00e9re, CNRS-IN2P3-Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud"}}}
