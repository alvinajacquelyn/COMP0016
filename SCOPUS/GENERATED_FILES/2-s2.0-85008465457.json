Their practice can support those who are dislocated, and who have no place. Teachers matter because they can help us understand how we share humanity and aspirations across many differences. The discussion identifies some similarities between approaches to pedagogy and Seyla Benhabib\u2019s notion of democratic iteration. Both concepts suggest a navigation between the general, the particular and some of the complexities of their contradictions which can guide teachers\u2019 work. Frameworks from cosmopolitanism and the capability approach are explored for detail they provide on how this navigation can be considered in practice across differently politically constituted formations and diverse, unequally situated groups. Drawing on some reflections on work in an international classroom, the conclusion explores some of these navigations across inequalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capabilities", "Cosmopolitanism", "democratic iteration", "equity", "pedagogy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008465457", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8597670400": {"Name": "Unterhalter E.", "AuthorID": "8597670400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
