We examined: (i) income inequalities in implant use; and (ii) whether income or education has a stronger association with implant use in elder Japanese. Methods: In 2016, a self-reported questionnaire was mailed to participants aged 65 years or older living across Japan as part of the ongoing Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study. We used data from 84,718 respondents having 19 or fewer teeth. After multiple imputation, multi-level logistic regression estimated the association of dental implant use with equivalised income level and years of formal education. Confounders were age, sex, and density of dental clinics in the residential area. Results: 3.1% of respondents had dental implants. Percentages of dental implant use among the lowest (\u2264 9 years) and highest (\u2265 13 years) educational groups were 1.8 and 5.1, respectively, and among the lowest (0 < 12.2 \u20181,000 USD/year\u2019) and highest (\u2265 59.4 \u20181,000 USD/year\u2019) income groups were 1.7 and 10.4, respectively. A fully adjusted model revealed that both income and education were independently associated with dental implant use. Odds ratios for implant use in the highest education and income groups were 2.13 [95% CI = 1.94\u20132.35] and 4.85 [95% CI = 3.78\u20136.22] compared with the lowest education and income groups, respectively. From a model with standardised variables, income showed slightly stronger association than education. Conclusion: This study reveals a public health problem that even those with the highest education but low income might have limited accessibility to dental implant services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["access to care", "Dental implant(s)", "dental public health", "dental services research", "epidemiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Dental Care", "Dental Implants", "Humans", "Income", "Japan", "Social Class"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068163042", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57209572829": {"Name": "Abbas H.", "AuthorID": "57209572829", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of International and Community Oral Health, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University"}, "22984268200": {"Name": "Aida J.", "AuthorID": "22984268200", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of International and Community Oral Health, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University"}, "36852116300": {"Name": "Osaka K.", "AuthorID": "36852116300", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of International and Community Oral Health, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University"}, "37001221100": {"Name": "Saito M.", "AuthorID": "37001221100", "AffiliationID": "60023165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Welfare, Nihon Fukushi University"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24923044200": {"Name": "Koyama S.", "AuthorID": "24923044200", "AffiliationID": "60011374", "AffiliationName": "Dental Implant Center, Tohoku University Hospital"}, "16834880600": {"Name": "Kondo K.", "AuthorID": "16834880600", "AffiliationID": "60025760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gerontological Evaluation, Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology"}}}
