It provides a rapid and flexible method of estimating the parameters of a psychophysical model, and is also capable of advising the user on the most appropriate stimuli to present, and on when to terminate testing. Of particular note is the algorithm\u2019s ability to use prior information, its ability to determine the maximally informative stimulus on each trial, its ability to fit arbitrarily complex models, and its ability to vary multiple stimulus properties simultaneously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive algorithms", "Bayes", "curve fitting", "entropy", "Matlab", "maximum likelihood", "psychophysics", "QUEST+"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070821711", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.R.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
