The pollution is caused primarily by, or as a side reaction of, the microbial reduction of sedimentary Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides, but the organism(s) responsible for As release have not been isolated. Here we report the first isolation of a dissimilatory arsenate reducer from sediments of the Bengal Basin in West Bengal. The bacterium, here designated WB3, respires soluble arsenate and couples its reduction to the oxidation of acetate; WB3 is therefore implicated in the process of arsenic pollution of groundwater, which is largely by arsenite. The bacterium WB3 is also capable of reducing dissolved Fe(III) citrate, solid Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide, and elemental sulfur, using acetate as the electron donor. It is a member of the Desulfuromonas genus and possesses a dissimilatory arsenate reductase that was identified using degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers. The sediment from which WB3 was isolated was brown, Pleistocene sand at a depth of 35.2 m below ground level (mbgl). This level was some 3 cm below the boundary between the brown sands and overlying reduced, gray, Holocene aquifer sands. The color boundary is interpreted to be a reduction front that releases As for resorption downflow, yielding a high load of labile As sorbed to the sediment at a depth of 35.8 mbgl and concentrations of As in groundwater that reach >1000 \u03bcg/L.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arsenate reductase", "Arsenic pollution", "Electron donors", "Elemental sulfur", "Microbial reduction", "Pleistocene sands", "Polluted aquifers", "Side reactions", "Arsenates", "Arsenic", "Asia, Western", "Desulfuromonas", "Environmental Monitoring", "Ferric Compounds", "Geologic Sediments", "Groundwater", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926483339", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"]], "AuthorData": {"36348658000": {"Name": "Osborne T.H.", "AuthorID": "36348658000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57218181351": {"Name": "Santini J.M.", "AuthorID": "57218181351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "23047645000": {"Name": "McArthur J.M.", "AuthorID": "23047645000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56304987300": {"Name": "Sikdar P.K.", "AuthorID": "56304987300", "AffiliationID": "60026603", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management, College Square West"}}}
