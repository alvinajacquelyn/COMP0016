Objective To overview the use and key elements of ERAS pathways, and define needs for future clinical trials. Evidence acquisition A comprehensive systematic MEDLINE search was performed for English language reports published before May 2015 using the terms \u201cpostoperative period,\u201d \u201cpostoperative care,\u201d \u201cenhanced recovery after surgery,\u201d \u201cenhanced recovery,\u201d \u201caccelerated recovery,\u201d \u201cfast track recovery,\u201d \u201crecovery program,\u201d \u201crecovery pathway\u201d, \u201cERAS,\u201d and \u201curology\u201d or \u201ccystectomy\u201d or \u201curologic surgery.\u201d Evidence synthesis We identified 18 eligible articles. Patient counseling, physical conditioning, avoiding excessive alcohol and smoking, and good nutrition appeared to protect against postoperative complications. Fasting from solid food for only 6 h and perioperative liquid\u2013carbohydrate loading up to 2 h prior to surgery appeared to be safe and reduced recovery times. Restricted, balanced, and goal-directed fluid replacement is effective when individualized, depending on patient morbidity and surgical procedure. Decreased intraoperative blood loss may be achieved by several measures. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis, and thermoregulation were found to help reduce postsurgical complications, as was a multimodal approach to postoperative nausea, vomiting, and analgesia. Chewing gum, prokinetic agents, oral laxatives, and an early resumption to normal diet appear to aid faster return to normal bowel function. Further studies should compare anesthetic protocols, refine analgesia, and evaluate the importance of robot-assisted surgery and the need/timing for drains and catheters. Conclusions ERAS regimens are multidisciplinary, multimodal pathways that optimize postoperative recovery. Patient summary This review provides an overview of the use and key elements of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery programs, which are multimodal, multidisciplinary care pathways that aim to optimize postoperative recovery. Additional conclusions include identifying effective procedures within Enhanced Recovery after Surgery programs and defining needs for future clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enhanced recovery after surgery", "ERAS", "Perioperative care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diet", "Early Ambulation", "Perioperative Care", "Postoperative Complications", "Recovery of Function", "Smoking Cessation", "Time Factors", "Urologic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959931549", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"35331778600": {"Name": "Azhar R.", "AuthorID": "35331778600", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "USC Institute of Urology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "7201841144": {"Name": "Desai M.", "AuthorID": "7201841144", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "USC Institute of Urology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "7102673673": {"Name": "Bochner B.", "AuthorID": "7102673673", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "6603789337": {"Name": "Catto J.", "AuthorID": "6603789337", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Units of Urology and Molecular Oncology, University of Sheffield"}, "24401086200": {"Name": "Goh A.", "AuthorID": "24401086200", "AffiliationID": "60014933", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Houston Methodist Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "55759511719": {"Name": "Patel H.", "AuthorID": "55759511719", "AffiliationID": "60006433, 60003443", "AffiliationName": "James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions"}, "57000636200": {"Name": "Pruthi R.", "AuthorID": "57000636200", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Division of Urologic Surgery, The University of North Carolina"}, "57203030392": {"Name": "Thalmann G.", "AuthorID": "57203030392", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Inselspital"}}}
