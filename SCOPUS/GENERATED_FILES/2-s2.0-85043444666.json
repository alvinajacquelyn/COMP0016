All rights reserved.Concept learning describes the process by which experience allows us to partition objects in the world into classes for the purpose of generalization, discrimination, and inference. Formal models of concept learning and categorization make divergent assumptions about knowledge representation (for instance, prototypes, exemplars, and rules). As reviewed here, empirical comparisons of such models have enhanced our understanding of key issues such as the role of selective attention in concept learning, the time course of categorization decisions, and the interpretation of neuroscientific findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Categorization", "Concept", "Exemplar", "Learning", "Memory", "Neuropsychology", "Perception", "Prototype", "Representation", "Rule"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043444666", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
