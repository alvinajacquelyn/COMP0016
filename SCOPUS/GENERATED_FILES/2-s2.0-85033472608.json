Africa, and more specifically, sub-Saharan Africa, carries a substantial portion of the global burden of viral hepatitis, especially chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. The task that lies ahead for sub-Saharan Africa to achieve elimination is substantial, but not insurmountable. Major developments in the management of hepatitis C have put elimination within reach, but several difficulties will need to be navigated on the path to elimination. Many of the challenges faced are unique to sub-Saharan Africa and the development of strategies is complicated by a scarcity of good data from countries and regions within sub-Saharan Africa. However, this hindrance should not act as a barrier to delay interventions in screening, detection, and linkage to care. Moreover, by sharing experiences from across sub-Saharan Africa, countries can create supranational synergies to develop their programmes and work together in a more cohesive manner to tackle the burden of hepatitis C in sub-Saharan Africa. In this Series paper, several issues related to hepatitis C in sub-Saharan Africa are addressed, including prevalence, risk factors, and fibrosis assessment, and recommendations are given by experts from across the region. Simplified diagnostic algorithms and treatment regimens for both HIV co-infected and hepatitis C mono-infected patients are suggested. The recommendations are consensus based and provided to guide the development of programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Political will and appropriate funding will be required to provide impetus to implement these recommendations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Africa South of the Sahara", "Antiviral Agents", "Coinfection", "Fibrosis", "Genotype", "Health Care Costs", "Hepatitis C", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033472608", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"26028112700": {"Name": "Sonderup M.W.", "AuthorID": "26028112700", "AffiliationID": "60010932, 60003757", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences and Groote Schuur Hospital"}, "37012044700": {"Name": "Gogela N.", "AuthorID": "37012044700", "AffiliationID": "60010932, 60003757", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences and Groote Schuur Hospital"}, "6602099397": {"Name": "Spearman C.W.", "AuthorID": "6602099397", "AffiliationID": "60010932, 60003757", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences and Groote Schuur Hospital"}, "56427900200": {"Name": "Afihene M.", "AuthorID": "56427900200", "AffiliationID": "60071885, 60071879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital"}, "6602761633": {"Name": "Ally R.", "AuthorID": "6602761633", "AffiliationID": "60027219, 60016218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University of Witwatersrand, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital"}, "55801218500": {"Name": "Apica B.", "AuthorID": "55801218500", "AffiliationID": "60196602, 60071696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Mulago Hospital"}, "55102840600": {"Name": "Awuku Y.", "AuthorID": "55102840600", "AffiliationID": "60071895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, School of Medical Sciences, University of Cape Coast"}, "22939845500": {"Name": "Cunha L.", "AuthorID": "22939845500", "AffiliationID": "60072688", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Privado de Maputo, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60021923", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School, Kings College Hospital"}, "7801546679": {"Name": "Lohou\u00e8s-Kouacou M.J.", "AuthorID": "7801546679", "AffiliationID": "119750217", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Houphouet Boigny de Cocody"}, "57196472165": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "57196472165", "AffiliationID": "100375532", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Victoria Hospital"}, "6507169522": {"Name": "Lesi O.", "AuthorID": "6507169522", "AffiliationID": "60024019, 60006448", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Lagos"}, "8370890900": {"Name": "Mbaye P.S.", "AuthorID": "8370890900", "AffiliationID": "111295511", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Principal Hospital"}, "56204011500": {"Name": "Musabeyezu E.", "AuthorID": "56204011500", "AffiliationID": "119750199", "AffiliationName": "King Faisal Hospital and Great Lakes Polyclinic"}, "57196464684": {"Name": "Musau B.", "AuthorID": "57196464684", "AffiliationID": "60064013", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Nairobi Hospital"}, "57213351726": {"Name": "Ojo O.", "AuthorID": "57213351726", "AffiliationID": "60011031", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology and Liver Pathology Unit, Department of Morbid Anatomy, Obafemi Awolowo University and Teaching Hospital"}, "57194564523": {"Name": "Rwegasha J.", "AuthorID": "57194564523", "AffiliationID": "60071590", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili National Hospital"}, "36194089800": {"Name": "Scholz B.", "AuthorID": "36194089800", "AffiliationID": "119750212", "AffiliationName": "Roman Catholic Hospital"}, "57190417762": {"Name": "Shewaye A.B.", "AuthorID": "57190417762", "AffiliationID": "60071181", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Addis Ababa University Medical School"}, "6603367678": {"Name": "Tzeuton C.", "AuthorID": "6603367678", "AffiliationID": "106549084", "AffiliationName": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise de Gastro-Ent\u00e9rologie, Douala Teaching Hospital"}, "6602144179": {"Name": "Kassianides C.", "AuthorID": "6602144179", "AffiliationID": "100580214", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Foundation of South Africa, Morningside MediClinic Hospital"}}}
