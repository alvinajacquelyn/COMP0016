Compounds 1\u20133 are coordinated to the vanadium centre through the two carbonyl oxygen atoms of the bidentate ligand. It was determined by X-ray crystallography that the structures of the resulting complexes were significantly different, resulting in a monomeric complex (1), a tetrameric ring (2) and a 1D coordination polymer (3). Following the synthesis and isolation of 1\u20133, they were tested as precursors for vanadium nitride and vanadium carbide by annealing under nitrogen and argon respectively at 1200 \u00b0C for 24 h. The resulting materials were characterised by: XRD, EDS, XPS and TEM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ester adducts", "Hard materials", "Precursors", "Vanadium carbide", "Vanadium nitride", "Vanadium oxychloride"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hard material", "Oxychlorides", "Precursors", "Vanadium carbides", "Vanadium nitrides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978794675", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56702289700": {"Name": "Blackburn B.", "AuthorID": "56702289700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36781832800": {"Name": "Crane J.", "AuthorID": "36781832800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55839956500": {"Name": "Powell M.", "AuthorID": "55839956500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55243347800": {"Name": "Marchand P.", "AuthorID": "55243347800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57197043008": {"Name": "Pugh D.", "AuthorID": "57197043008", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}}}
