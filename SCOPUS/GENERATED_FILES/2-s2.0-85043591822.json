Method: Concept mapping techniques were used to identify key themes, wherein participants generated, sorted, and rated the importance of statements in response to the question \u201cWhat must hearing aid owners do in order to use, handle, manage, maintain, and care for their hearing aids?\u201d Twenty-four hearing aid owners (56 to 91 years of age; 54.2% men, 45.8% women) and 22 clinicians (32 to 69 years of age; 9.1% men, 90.9% women) participated. Result: Participants identified 111 unique items describing hearing aid management within 6 concepts: (a) \u201cDaily Hearing Aid Use,\u201d (b) \u201cHearing Aid Maintenance and Repairs,\u201d (c) \u201cLearning to Come to Terms with Hearing Aids,\u201d (d) \u201cCommunication Strategies,\u201d (e) \u201cWorking With Your Clinician,\u201d and (f) \u201cAdvanced Hearing Aid Knowledge.\u201d Clinicians\u2019 opinions of the importance of each statement varied only slightly from the opinions of the hearing aid owner group. Hearing aid owners indicated that all 6 concepts were of similar importance, whereas clinicians indicated that the concept \u201cAdvanced Hearing Aid Knowledge\u201d was significantly less important than the other 5 concepts. Conclusion: The results highlight the magnitude of information and skill required to optimally manage hearing aids. Clinical recommendations are made to improve hearing aid handling education and skill acquisition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Audiologists", "Australia", "Clinical Competence", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Risk Assessment", "Self Efficacy", "Sex Factors", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043591822", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"56810295100": {"Name": "Bennett R.", "AuthorID": "56810295100", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Ear Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia"}, "7006848551": {"Name": "Eikelboom R.", "AuthorID": "7006848551", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, University of Pretoria"}, "35564776900": {"Name": "Atlas M.", "AuthorID": "35564776900", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Ear Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland"}}}
