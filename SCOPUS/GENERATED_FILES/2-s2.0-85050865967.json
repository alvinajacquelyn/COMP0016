Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest bacterial cause of empyema in children and among the commonest in adults. The mesothelium represents the first line of defense against invading microorganisms, but mesothelial cell responses to common empyema pathogens, including S. pneumoniae, have seldom been studied. We assessed mesothelial cell viability in vitro following exposure to common empyema pathogens. Clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae from 25 patients with invasive pneumococcal disease and three reference strains were tested. All potently induced death of cultured mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) in a dose- and time-dependent manner (>90% at 107 CFU/mL after 24 hours). No significant mesothelial cell killing was observed when cells were co-cultured with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus milleri group bacteria. S. pneumoniae induced mesothelial cell death via secretory product(s) as cytotoxicity could be: i) reproduced using conditioned media derived from S. pneumoniae and ii) in transwell studies when the bacteria and mesothelial cells were separated. No excess cell death was seen when heat-killed S. pneumoniae were used. Pneumolysin, a cytolytic S. pneumoniae toxin, induced cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. S. pneumoniae lacking the pneumolysin gene (D39 \u0394PLY strain) failed to kill mesothelial cells compared to wild type (D39) controls, confirming the necessity of pneumolysin in D39-induced mesothelial cell death. However, pneumolysin gene mutation in other S. pneumoniae strains (TIGR4, ST3 and ST23F) only partly abolished their cytotoxic effects, suggesting different strains may induce cell death via different mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Cell Death", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Child", "Empyema, Pleural", "Epithelial Cells", "Epithelium", "Humans", "Pleura", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Streptolysins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050865967", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56520289600": {"Name": "Rashwan R.", "AuthorID": "56520289600", "AffiliationID": "60009750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University"}, "55985567600": {"Name": "Varano della Vergiliana J.F.", "AuthorID": "55985567600", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia"}, "18634653000": {"Name": "Lansley S.M.", "AuthorID": "18634653000", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia"}, "56720253600": {"Name": "Cheah H.M.", "AuthorID": "56720253600", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia"}, "56437757300": {"Name": "Popowicz N.", "AuthorID": "56437757300", "AffiliationID": "60025898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}, "57201708864": {"Name": "Gary Lee Y.C.", "AuthorID": "57201708864", "AffiliationID": "60025898", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Respiratory Medicine, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}, "7102813284": {"Name": "Paton J.C.", "AuthorID": "7102813284", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Adelaide"}, "7004316792": {"Name": "Waterer G.W.", "AuthorID": "7004316792", "AffiliationID": "60030929", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Department, Royal Perth Hospital"}, "57203184793": {"Name": "Townsend T.", "AuthorID": "57203184793", "AffiliationID": "60030929", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Royal Perth Hospital"}, "7006523303": {"Name": "Kay I.", "AuthorID": "7006523303", "AffiliationID": "60030929", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Royal Perth Hospital"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.S.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}}}
