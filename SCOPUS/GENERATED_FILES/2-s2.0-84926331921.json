OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with the risk, onset, and persistence of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed univariate and multivariable analyses of 338 lumbar punctures in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study using linear mixed models, adjusting for participant-level and family-level random effects. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We directly evaluated associations of 3 post-lumbar puncture outcomes (immediate postprocedural headache, PDPH at 24-hour follow-up, and PDPH receiving a therapeutic blood patch) with participant age and sex, positioning, collection method, needle size, needle insertion site, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume collected. RESULTS: The incidence of adverse events included 73 immediate postprocedural headaches (21.6%), 59 PDPHs at 24-hour follow-up (17.5%), and 15 PDPHs receiving a therapeutic blood patch (4.4%). Greater volume of CSF collected was associated with increased risk of immediate postprocedural headache, largely owing to a nonlinear increase in risk on collection of volumes above 30 mL (odds ratio, 3.73 for >30 mL and 0.98 for <17 mL). In contrast, collection of higher volumes showed a protective effect in decreasing rates of PDPH at 24-hour follow-up and rates of PDPH receiving a therapeutic blood patch (odds ratio, 0.35 per 10 mL). Although differences in needle size did not reach statistical significance, no participant in the 24G needle group received a therapeutic blood patch compared to 8 of 253 for the larger 22G needles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Factors that acutely lower CSF pressure (eg, seated positioning or extracting very high volumes of CSF) may be associated with transient post-lumbar puncture headache, without increasing rates of persistent PDPH or therapeutic blood patch. Collection of up to 30 mL of CSF appears to be well tolerated and safe.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Patch, Epidural", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Post-Dural Puncture Headache", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Spinal Puncture", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926331921", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56582236500": {"Name": "Monserrate A.E.", "AuthorID": "56582236500", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "15760626500": {"Name": "Ryman D.C.", "AuthorID": "15760626500", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Clinical Core, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57001832600": {"Name": "Ma S.", "AuthorID": "57001832600", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57210139888": {"Name": "Morris J.C.", "AuthorID": "57210139888", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "8878906200": {"Name": "Clifford D.B.", "AuthorID": "8878906200", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7006947447": {"Name": "Fagan A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006947447", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "55844845300": {"Name": "Oliver A.", "AuthorID": "55844845300", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "27169448500": {"Name": "Bateman R.J.", "AuthorID": "27169448500", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57206766518": {"Name": "Xiong C.", "AuthorID": "57206766518", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7202238298": {"Name": "Noble J.M.", "AuthorID": "7202238298", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "56913106000": {"Name": "Ringman J.M.", "AuthorID": "56913106000", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Mary S.
