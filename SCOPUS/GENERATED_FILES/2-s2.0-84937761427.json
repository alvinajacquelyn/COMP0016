In the primary sensorimotor cortex, arm amputation results in massive local remapping of the missing hands' cortical territory. However, little is known about the consequences of sensorimotor deprivation on global brain organisation. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to identify large-scale reorganisation beyond the primary sensorimotor cortex in arm amputees, compared with two-handed controls. Specifically, we characterised changes in functional connectivity between the cortical territory of the missing hand in the primary sensorimotor cortex ('missing hand cortex') and two networks of interest: the sensorimotor network, which is typically strongly associated with the hand cortex, and the default mode network (DMN), which is normally dissociated from it. Functional connectivity values between the missing hand cortex and the sensorimotor network were reduced in amputees, and connectivity was weaker in individuals amputated for longer periods. Lower levels of functional coupling between the missing hand cortex and the sensorimotor network were also associated with emerged coupling of this cortex with the DMN. Our results demonstrate that plasticity following arm amputation is not restricted to local remapping occurring within the sensorimotor homunculus of the missing hand but rather produces a cascade of cortical reorganisation at a network-level scale. These findings may provide a new framework for understanding how local deprivation following amputation could elicit complex perceptual experiences of phantom sensations, such as phantom pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deprivation", "Motor", "Neuroimaging", "Plasticity", "Resting state networks", "Somatosensory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amputation", "Arm", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Sensorimotor Cortex", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937761427", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"15835219200": {"Name": "Makin T.R.", "AuthorID": "15835219200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "26221643100": {"Name": "Filippini N.", "AuthorID": "26221643100", "AffiliationID": "60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital"}, "9845393700": {"Name": "Duff E.P.", "AuthorID": "9845393700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "24461774900": {"Name": "Henderson Slater D.", "AuthorID": "24461774900", "AffiliationID": "60115285, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Enablement, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre"}, "57191026623": {"Name": "Tracey I.", "AuthorID": "57191026623", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Division of Anaesthetics, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Oxford"}, "6701480981": {"Name": "Johansen-Berg H.", "AuthorID": "6701480981", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}}}
