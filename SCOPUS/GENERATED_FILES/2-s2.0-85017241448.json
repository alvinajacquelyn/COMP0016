All rights reserved.The function of cortical GABAergic interneurons is largely determined by their integration into specific neural circuits, but the mechanisms controlling the wiring of these cells remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for a major population of basket cells that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Here we found that the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 was required for the normal integration into cortical circuits of basket cells expressing CCK and vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGlut3). The number of inhibitory synapses made by CCK+ VGlut3+ basket cells and the inhibitory drive they exerted on pyramidal cells were reduced in conditional mice lacking ErbB4. Developmental disruption of the connectivity of these cells diminished the power of theta oscillations during exploratory behavior, disrupted spatial coding by place cells, and caused selective alterations in spatial learning and memory in adult mice. These results suggest that normal integration of CCK+ basket cells in cortical networks is key to support spatial coding in the hippocampus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Transport Systems, Acidic", "Animals", "CA1 Region, Hippocampal", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cholecystokinin", "Exploratory Behavior", "GABAergic Neurons", "Interneurons", "Locomotion", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Inhibition", "Neural Pathways", "Place Cells", "Prepulse Inhibition", "Pyramidal Cells", "Receptor, ErbB-4", "Spatial Learning", "Spatial Memory", "Theta Rhythm"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017241448", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57196727240": {"Name": "Del Pino I.", "AuthorID": "57196727240", "AffiliationID": "60106891, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Neurocentre Magendie, INSERM U1215"}, "55500396300": {"Name": "Marques-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "55500396300", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "7005583174": {"Name": "Mar\u00edn O.", "AuthorID": "7005583174", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "6603595848": {"Name": "Rico B.", "AuthorID": "6603595848", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "35775850400": {"Name": "Brotons-Mas J.", "AuthorID": "35775850400", "AffiliationID": "60029767, 60017107, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neurociencias, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez"}, "6603785833": {"Name": "Marighetto A.", "AuthorID": "6603785833", "AffiliationID": "60106891, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Neurocentre Magendie, INSERM U1215"}, "57209479913": {"Name": "Frick A.", "AuthorID": "57209479913", "AffiliationID": "60106891, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Neurocentre Magendie, INSERM U1215"}}}
