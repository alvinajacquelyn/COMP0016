EDS analysis suggests that Nb is homogeneously distributed throughout the structure. The addition of fructose as a reagent in the hydrothermal flow process, followed by a post synthesis heat-treatment, affords a continuous graphitic carbon coating on the particle surfaces. Electrochemical testing reveals that cycling performance improves with increasing dopant concentration, up to a maximum of 1.0 at% Nb, for which point a specific capacity of 110 mAh g\u22121 is obtained at 10 C (6 min for the charge or discharge). This is an excellent result for a high power cathode LFP based material, particularly when considering the synthesis was performed on a large pilot-scale apparatus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cathode material", "Continuous hydrothermal", "Doped", "Li-ion battery", "LiFePO4", "Niobium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cath-ode materials", "Continuous hydrothermal", "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Dopant concentrations", "Doped", "Electrochemical testing", "LiFePO", "Pilot-scale apparatus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978536007", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56559457100": {"Name": "Johnson I.", "AuthorID": "56559457100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57190231017": {"Name": "Blagovidova E.", "AuthorID": "57190231017", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56110105000": {"Name": "Dingwall P.", "AuthorID": "56110105000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
