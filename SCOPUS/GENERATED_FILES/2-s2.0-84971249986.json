Forty human donor corneas were placed in small petri-plates with epithelial side facing up. Polarizing power (arbitrary unit) and crosses were monitored and recorded by the software. The tissue was marked at \u2018Superior\u2019 position to ensure that the base and the polarizer are in alignment with each other after the cut. The anterior lamellar cut was performed using microkeratome. The lenticule was placed back in the same position as marked to mimic the alignment. The tissue was further rotated by 45\u00b0 ensuring that the base of the cornea and the polarizer were in alignment. The polarization power and \u2018crosses\u2019 were identified at each step. The average of forty corneas from pre-cut to post-45\u00b0 angular change showed statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in terms of polarizing power. The cross-shaped pattern deformed and lost the sharpness towards 45\u00b0 angle. However, multiple variances in terms of \u2018cross-patterns\u2019 were observed throughout the study. Lumaxis\u00ae was able to determine the worst quality tissue in terms of polarization (no black zone and crosses). Despite the quality of cross pattern which can be used as an additional objective parameter to evaluate the optical properties of the corneal tissue, this preliminary study needs to be further justified in terms of clinical relevance whether polarization changes with oriented or de-oriented grafts have any effects and consequences on the visual acuity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cornea", "Eye bank", "Isogyres", "Lumaxis\u00ae", "Polarizer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cornea", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Microscopy, Polarization", "Tissue Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971249986", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology (ICOP), The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "8681862500": {"Name": "Ruzza A.", "AuthorID": "8681862500", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology (ICOP), The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57190211074": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "57190211074", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology (ICOP), The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "6503974063": {"Name": "Salvalaio G.", "AuthorID": "6503974063", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology (ICOP), The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "55282959100": {"Name": "Elbadawy H.", "AuthorID": "55282959100", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology (ICOP), The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "6603422101": {"Name": "Ponzin D.", "AuthorID": "6603422101", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology (ICOP), The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57110351600": {"Name": "Lipari E.", "AuthorID": "57110351600", "AffiliationID": "116728302", "AffiliationName": "Phronema srl"}}}
