When high frequencies are employed, the use of BR is a good approximation to describe the propagation of the front of the pressure wave. The quantitative accuracy of the images reconstructed with the BR algorithm was evaluated without any kind of regularization, and with two regularization methods. The regularizations were based on some available a priori information, namely the known higher and lower values of the speed of sound expected in the breast tissues, and the maps of the internal structures obtained from the standard reflection ultrasound (US) imaging. The use of the proposed regularizations in the implemented algorithm improves the convergence and quality of the resulting images, although further improvements are still possible. These methods will help obtaining quantitative US images in a reasonable amount of time, expanding the possibilities and applications of this technique.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["High frequency HF", "Internal structure", "Priori information", "Quantitative accuracy", "Regularization methods", "Tracing algorithm", "Ultrasound computed tomography", "Ultrasound imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994226409", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"56449437100": {"Name": "Perez-Liva M.", "AuthorID": "56449437100", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Grupo de F\u00edsica Nuclear, Facultad de Ciencias F\u00edsicas"}, "14522681300": {"Name": "Herraiz J.L.", "AuthorID": "14522681300", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Grupo de F\u00edsica Nuclear, Facultad de Ciencias F\u00edsicas"}, "6701483306": {"Name": "Udias J.M.", "AuthorID": "6701483306", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Grupo de F\u00edsica Nuclear, Facultad de Ciencias F\u00edsicas"}, "57188640352": {"Name": "Medina-Valdes L.", "AuthorID": "57188640352", "AffiliationID": "60119988, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Group of Ultrasonic Systems, Technology ITEFI Torres Quevedo CSIC, Spanish National Research Council"}, "24329235600": {"Name": "Camacho J.", "AuthorID": "24329235600", "AffiliationID": "60119988, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Group of Ultrasonic Systems, Technology ITEFI Torres Quevedo CSIC, Spanish National Research Council"}, "56235606600": {"Name": "Fritsch C.", "AuthorID": "56235606600", "AffiliationID": "60119988, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Group of Ultrasonic Systems, Technology ITEFI Torres Quevedo CSIC, Spanish National Research Council"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.E.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, Wolfson House"}}}
