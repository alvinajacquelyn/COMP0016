We also present practical reasoning approaches that we have developed during the last decade for ambient intelligence and robotics applications. Finally, we discuss future directions that should be investigated to implement high-level cognitive capabilities that can be supported by cloud computing platforms as reasoning backend for robots and connected devices in smart spaces. These will enhance the human-environment interaction using robots, emergency prevention, management and rescue.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient intelligence", "Cloud computing platforms", "Cognitive capability", "Dynamic environments", "Human-environment interaction", "Practical reasoning", "Reasoning mechanism", "Robotics applications"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926051773", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"34167721100": {"Name": "Chibani A.", "AuthorID": "34167721100", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "LISSI Laboratory, University Paris Est Crteil"}, "23390146200": {"Name": "Patkos T.", "AuthorID": "23390146200", "AffiliationID": "60035865", "AffiliationName": "FORTH ICS"}, "7003336093": {"Name": "Amirat Y.", "AuthorID": "7003336093", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "LISSI Laboratory, University Paris Est Crteil"}, "55601830400": {"Name": "Bouznad S.", "AuthorID": "55601830400", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "LISSI Laboratory, University Paris Est Crteil"}, "36611243700": {"Name": "Ayari N.", "AuthorID": "36611243700", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "LISSI Laboratory, University Paris Est Crteil"}, "36081143400": {"Name": "Sabri L.", "AuthorID": "36081143400", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "LISSI Laboratory, University Paris Est Crteil"}, "11641015900": {"Name": "Bikakis A.", "AuthorID": "11641015900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
