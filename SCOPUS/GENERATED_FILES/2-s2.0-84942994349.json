We derived the probabilities of overdiagnosis by quartiles of polygenic risk considering that the observed prevalence of screen-detected prostate cancer is a combination of underlying incidence, mean sojourn time (MST), test sensitivity, and overdiagnosis.Results:Polygenic risk quartiles 1 to 4 comprised 9, 18, 25, and 48% of the cases, respectively. For a prostate-specific antigen test sensitivity of 80% and MST of 9 years, 43, 30, 25, and 19% of the prevalent screen-detected cancers in quartiles 1 to 4, respectively, were likely to be overdiagnosed cancers. Overdiagnosis decreased with increasing polygenic risk, with 56% decrease between the lowest and the highest polygenic risk quartiles.Conclusion:Targeting screening to men at higher polygenic risk could reduce the problem of overdiagnosis and lead to a better benefit-to-harm balance in screening for prostate cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["overdiagnosis", "polygenic risk", "prostate cancer", "riskstratified screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Algorithms", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Male", "Medical Overuse", "Middle Aged", "Models, Genetic", "Models, Statistical", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Risk", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942994349", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57204528351": {"Name": "Pashayan N.", "AuthorID": "57204528351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "24427029200": {"Name": "Duffy S.W.", "AuthorID": "24427029200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Prevention, Mathematics and Statistics, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35393852700": {"Name": "Neal D.E.", "AuthorID": "35393852700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120009", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "7004785343": {"Name": "Hamdy F.C.", "AuthorID": "7004785343", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Surgery, Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7201817264": {"Name": "Donovan J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201817264", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55689388800": {"Name": "Martin R.M.", "AuthorID": "55689388800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57209648187": {"Name": "Harrington P.", "AuthorID": "57209648187", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "41860918900": {"Name": "Benlloch S.", "AuthorID": "41860918900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "45761074400": {"Name": "Amin Al Olama A.", "AuthorID": "45761074400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "6701783006": {"Name": "Easton D.F.", "AuthorID": "6701783006", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "7102929844": {"Name": "Pharoah P.D.", "AuthorID": "7102929844", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57202124475": {"Name": "Shah M.", "AuthorID": "57202124475", "AffiliationID": "60027140, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Strangeways Research Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "6602820947": {"Name": "Kote-Jarai Z.", "AuthorID": "6602820947", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006235391": {"Name": "Eeles R.", "AuthorID": "7006235391", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
