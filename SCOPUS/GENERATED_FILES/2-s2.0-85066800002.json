While classic retrieval systems can only formulate simple searches such as \u201cfind the 3D model that is most similar to the input image\u201d our new approach can formulate advanced and semantically meaningful search queries such as: \u201cfind me the 3D model that best combines the design of the legs of the chair in image 1 but with no armrests, like the chair in image 2\u201d. Many applications could benefit from such rich queries, users could browse through catalogues of furniture and pick and mix parts, combining for example the legs of a chair from one shop and the armrests from another shop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Image embedding", "Shape blending", "Shape retrieval"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D shape retrieval", "Image embedding", "Image manifolds", "Internet images", "New approaches", "Retrieval systems", "Shape blending", "Shape retrieval"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066800002", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"26421312300": {"Name": "Penate-Sanchez A.", "AuthorID": "26421312300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Robotics Institute, University of Oxford"}, "12752515600": {"Name": "Agapito L.", "AuthorID": "12752515600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
