Yet, we still have limited information about Council politics because of the lack of suitable data. This paper validates a new approach to studying Council politics entitled DICEU \u2013 Debates in the Council of the European Union. This approach is the first to leverage the public videos of Council deliberations as a data source. We demonstrate the face, convergent, and predictive validity of DICEU data. Governments\u2019 ideal points scaled from these videos yield meaningful and well-known conflict dimensions. Moreover, governments\u2019 positions during Council negotiations correlate highly with expert assessments and predict subsequent votes on legislative acts. We conclude that DICEU data provide a promising new approach to studying Council politics and multilevel governance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Council", "dataset", "governments", "quantitative text analysis", "videos"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064718733", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"56487997200": {"Name": "Wratil C.", "AuthorID": "56487997200", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, University of Cologne"}, "9634821200": {"Name": "Hobolt S.B.", "AuthorID": "9634821200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
