Over the past 20 years, factors such as the connectivity costs, pumping costs, cost of safety device installations, pipe routing, multi-floor arrangements, etc., have all been included as constraints in a mathematical programming model to determine predominantly, the most cost effective and safe means for plant layouts. This work proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to include more realistic considerations for the multi-floor process plant layout problem - specifically tall process plant units with heights well above the typical floor height - which are common in most process plants but have not been given considerable attention in previous works. The model accounts for floor construction costs, area-dependent land use costs, pumping costs (upwards and within the same floor), connection costs by pipes as well as variable connection points along the heights of process units. The proposed optimisation approach has been applied successfully to an industry-relevant examples of 17 processing units with satisfactory computational results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MILP", "multi-floor plant layout", "optimisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049334238", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57202766424": {"Name": "Ejeh J.O.", "AuthorID": "57202766424", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "25628253900": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "25628253900", "AffiliationID": "60170469", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Swansea University"}}}
