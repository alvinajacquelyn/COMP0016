There are however no predictive indicators of the severity or long-term outcome after GMH-IVH. In recent years, endosome-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes have been isolated from biofluids and shown to mediate intercellular communication via selective enrichment in proteins and micro-RNAs. Methods: This study aimed to isolate and characterise EVs from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 3 preterm infants with PHH using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with immunogold protein labelling, and micro-RNA analysis. Results: NTA of unaltered CSF revealed a heterogeneous and dynamic population of EVs. Exosomal-sized EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and TEM confirmed the presence of CD63 + and CD81 + exosomes. The micro-RNAs miR-9, miR-17, miR-26a, miR-124 and miR-1911 were detected within the exosome-enriched fraction and profiled over time. Conclusion: This is the first reported characterisation of exosomes from the CSF of preterm infants with post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral palsy", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Exosome", "Intraventricular hemorrhage", "Micro RNA", "Preterm infant"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Exosomes", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "MicroRNAs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059801741", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"56426356400": {"Name": "Spaull R.", "AuthorID": "56426356400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57205379517": {"Name": "McPherson B.", "AuthorID": "57205379517", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57205376984": {"Name": "Gialeli A.", "AuthorID": "57205376984", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "7004494549": {"Name": "Uney J.", "AuthorID": "7004494549", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "23049849100": {"Name": "Heep A.", "AuthorID": "23049849100", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Neurology Group, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "52463345700": {"Name": "Cordero-Llana \u00d3.", "AuthorID": "52463345700", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "7103308683": {"Name": "Clayton A.", "AuthorID": "7103308683", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Cardiff"}}}
