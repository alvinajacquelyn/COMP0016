It is shown that as the central redshift tends to zero, the states in such a family are well approximated by a steady state of the Vlasov-Poisson system, i.e., a Newtonian limit is established where the speed of light is kept constant as it should be and the limiting behavior is analysed in terms of a parameter which is tied to the physical properties of the individual solutions. This result is then used to investigate the stability properties of the relativistic steady states with small redshift parameter in the spirit of recent work by the same authors, i.e., the second variation of the ADM mass about such a steady state is shown to be positive definite on a suitable class of states.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945493967", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"23491961000": {"Name": "Had\u017eic M.", "AuthorID": "23491961000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Mathematics"}, "7005516726": {"Name": "Rein G.", "AuthorID": "7005516726", "AffiliationID": "60023208", "AffiliationName": "Mathematisches Institut, Universitat Bayreuth"}}}
