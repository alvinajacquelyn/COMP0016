Basing on previous studies (which suggested a possible role of altered inflammatory response in DS-related ID), we assessed the serum levels of a number of inflammatory biomarkers [serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (C-RP), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1)] in a cohort of individuals with DS and healthy controls. Methods: In total, 24 children diagnosed with DS and 12 healthy controls were enrolled, and all underwent detailed cognitive assessment. Also, serum SAA, C-RP and HMGB1 levels were measured in all recruited subjects and correlated to the severity of ID in the DS group. Results: Serum SAA, C-RP and HMGB1 values were found to be significantly higher in the DS group compared with the healthy subjects (P = 0.001). In addition, serum HMGB1 levels positively correlated with C-RP and SAA in the DS group but not in the healthy controls. Only serum C-RP levels resulted inversely correlated (P < 0.01) with intelligence quotient (IQ); conversely, significant statistical correlations between serum SAA levels and IQ (as well as between HMGB1 and IQ) have been not found (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The levels of the determined markers were higher in DS individuals compared with (cognitively) healthy subjects, and CRP showed a negative correlation with IQ in children with DS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-reactive protein", "children", "Down syndrome", "high mobility group box-1", "intellectual quotient", "serum amyloid A"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "HMGB1 Protein", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Intellectual Disability", "Italy", "Male", "Serum Amyloid A Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045119345", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55522578600": {"Name": "Manti S.", "AuthorID": "55522578600", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "35309819600": {"Name": "Cutrupi M.C.", "AuthorID": "35309819600", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "23469184800": {"Name": "Cuppari C.", "AuthorID": "23469184800", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "57193627375": {"Name": "Ferro E.", "AuthorID": "57193627375", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "56688617900": {"Name": "Dipasquale V.", "AuthorID": "56688617900", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "6507763943": {"Name": "Chimenz R.", "AuthorID": "6507763943", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "8603207400": {"Name": "La Rosa M.A.", "AuthorID": "8603207400", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, University Hospital of Messina"}, "56462570400": {"Name": "Di Rosa G.", "AuthorID": "56462570400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology of the Adult and Developmental Age \u2018Gaetano Barresi\u2019, Unit of Child Neurology and Psychiatry, University of Messina"}, "7006158742": {"Name": "Valenti A.", "AuthorID": "7006158742", "AffiliationID": "60012753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University Hospital of Messina"}, "6507973880": {"Name": "Salpietro V.", "AuthorID": "6507973880", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, University College of London"}}}
