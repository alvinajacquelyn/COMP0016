We prove that the indicator function of a generalized polytope P is a linear combination of indicator functions of simplices whose vertices are algebraic vertices of P. We also show that the indicator function of any generalized polyhedron is a linear combination, with integer coefficients, of indicator functions of cones with apices at algebraic vertices and line-cones. The concept of an algebraic vertex is closely related to the Fourier\u2013Laplace transform. We show that a point v is an algebraic vertex of a generalized polyhedron P if and only if the tangent cone of P, at v, has non-zero Fourier\u2013Laplace transform.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fourier\u2013Laplace transform", "Polytope algebra", "Tangent cones", "Vertices"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008168527", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"7007055298": {"Name": "Akopyan A.", "AuthorID": "7007055298", "AffiliationID": "60103776", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria)"}, "7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7103121308": {"Name": "Robins S.", "AuthorID": "7103121308", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Matematica e Estatistica, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
