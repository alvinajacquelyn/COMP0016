We previously reported a simple methodology for reducing these restrictions by the addition of a small amount of deuterated substrate. Herein, we evaluate the deuterium loadings that give the lowest errors in the determination of 2H KIEs. Our simulations indicate that our approach leads to a 4000-fold reduction in NMR time over natural abundance methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competition experiments at natural abundance and/or in isotopically enriched substrates", "Kinetic isotope effect", "Quantitative 2H NMR analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deuterium loading", "Isotopic enrichment", "Kinetic isotope effects", "Natural abundance", "NMR analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019115129", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56983007400": {"Name": "Colletto C.", "AuthorID": "56983007400", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "39162128800": {"Name": "Whitaker D.", "AuthorID": "39162128800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "6507507119": {"Name": "Larrosa I.", "AuthorID": "6507507119", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}}}
