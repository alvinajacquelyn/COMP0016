Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been implicated in this context, but there are conflicting reports as to whether it is a contributory or protective factor. Differential splicing of the VEGF-A gene produces multiple functional isoforms including VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b, a member of the inhibitory family. To date there is no clear information on the role of VEGF-A in IPF. Objectives: To establish VEGF-A isoform expression and functional effects in IPF. Methods: We used tissue sections, plasma, and lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF and control subjects. In a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model we used wild-type MMTV mice and a triple transgenic mouse SPC-rtTA+/- TetoCre LoxP-VEGF-A+/+ to conditionally induce VEGF-A isoform deletion specifically in the alveolar type II (ATII) cells of adult mice. Measurements and Main Results: IPF and normal lung fibroblasts differentially expressed and responded to VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b in terms of proliferation and matrix expression. Increased VEGF-A165b was detected in plasma of progressing patients with IPF. In a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, ATII-specific deficiency of VEGF-A or constitutive overexpression of VEGF-A165b inhibited the development of pulmonary fibrosis, as did treatment with intraperitoneal delivery of VEGF-A165b to wild-type mice. Conclusions: These results indicate that changes in the bioavailability of VEGF-A sourced from ATII cells, namely the ratio of VEGF-Axxxa to VEGF-Axxxb, are critical in development of pulmonary fibrosis and may be a paradigm for the regulation of tissue repair.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal models of pulmonary fibrosis", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "Vascular endothelial growth factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Lung", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Protein Isoforms", "Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028602209", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"16303098600": {"Name": "Barratt S.L.", "AuthorID": "16303098600", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Academic Respiratory Unit, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57194417452": {"Name": "Blythe T.", "AuthorID": "57194417452", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Academic Respiratory Unit, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "16233326400": {"Name": "Jarrett C.", "AuthorID": "16233326400", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Academic Respiratory Unit, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57193755891": {"Name": "Ourradi K.", "AuthorID": "57193755891", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Academic Respiratory Unit, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7201856714": {"Name": "Millar A.B.", "AuthorID": "7201856714", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Academic Respiratory Unit, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "36471089800": {"Name": "Shelley-Fraser G.", "AuthorID": "36471089800", "AffiliationID": "117670584", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Cheltenham and Gloucestershire NHS Trust"}, "24166167900": {"Name": "Day M.J.", "AuthorID": "24166167900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7403279604": {"Name": "Qiu Y.", "AuthorID": "7403279604", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Renal Unit, University of Bristol"}, "7102941685": {"Name": "Harper S.", "AuthorID": "7102941685", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Renal Unit, University of Bristol"}, "7006681013": {"Name": "Welsh G.I.", "AuthorID": "7006681013", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Renal Unit, University of Bristol"}, "56799189700": {"Name": "Maher T.M.", "AuthorID": "56799189700", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "14630870600": {"Name": "Oltean S.", "AuthorID": "14630870600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "57195526109": {"Name": "Hames T.J.", "AuthorID": "57195526109", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}, "8766774500": {"Name": "Scotton C.J.", "AuthorID": "8766774500", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7202955371": {"Name": "Bates D.O.", "AuthorID": "7202955371", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}}}
