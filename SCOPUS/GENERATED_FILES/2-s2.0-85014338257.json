Whereas the idea that a deficit of speech in noise perception is inherent to dyslexia is still debated, most studies have actually focused on the peripheral contribution to the dyslexics\u2019 difficulties of perceiving speech in noise. Here, we investigated the respective contribution of both peripheral and central noise in three groups of children: dyslexic, chronological age matched controls (CA), and reading-level matched controls (RL). In all noise conditions, dyslexics displayed significantly lower performance than CA controls. However, they performed similarly or even better than RL controls. Scrutinizing individual profiles failed to reveal a strong consistency in the speech perception difficulties experienced across all noise conditions, or across noise conditions and reading-related performances. Taken together, our results thus suggest that both peripheral and central interference contribute to the poorer speech in noise perception of dyslexic children, but that this difficulty is not a core deficit inherent to dyslexia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Dyslexia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Noise", "Perceptual Masking", "Phonetics", "Reading", "Speech", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014338257", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55490024400": {"Name": "Calcus A.", "AuthorID": "55490024400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "57190358546": {"Name": "Kolinsky R.", "AuthorID": "57190358546", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de Recherche en Neurosciences Cognitives (UNESCOG), Center for Research in Cognition & Neurosciences (CRCN), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "7102035644": {"Name": "Colin C.", "AuthorID": "7102035644", "AffiliationID": "60033044", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Neurophysiologie Sensorielle et Cognitive, H\u00f4pital Brugmann"}, "7004387518": {"Name": "Deltenre P.", "AuthorID": "7004387518", "AffiliationID": "60033044", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Neurophysiologie Sensorielle et Cognitive, H\u00f4pital Brugmann"}}}
