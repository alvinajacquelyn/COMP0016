Two days of basic scientific and technical instructions with \u201chands-on\u201d tutorials were followed by 3 days of invited presentations from active researchers in this and associated fields augmented by round-table discussions and dialogue boards with specific themes. These included the use of PET/MRI in paediatric oncology and in adult neurology, oncology and cardiology, the development of multi-parametric analyses, and efforts to standardise PET/MRI examinations to allow pooling of data for evaluating the technology. A poll taken on the final day demonstrated that over 50 % of those present felt that while PET/MRI technology underwent an inevitable slump after its much-anticipated initial launch, it was now entering a period of slow, progressive development, with new key applications emerging. In particular, researchers are focusing on exploiting the complementary nature of the physiological (PET) and biochemical (MRI/MRS) data within the morphological framework (MRI) that these devices can provide. Much of the discussion was summed up on the final day when one speaker commented on the state of PET/MRI: \u201cthe real work has just started\u201d.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attenuation correction", "Cardiology", "Hybrid imaging", "Molecular imaging", "MRI", "Neurology", "Oncology", "Paediatric oncology", "PET", "PET/CT", "PET/MRI", "Quantification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cardiology", "Germany", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Medical Oncology", "Multimodal Imaging", "Neurology", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939954514", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7402156045": {"Name": "Bailey D.", "AuthorID": "7402156045", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60006974", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney"}, "7003748937": {"Name": "Antoch G.", "AuthorID": "7003748937", "AffiliationID": "60072305", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Clinic D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "7005739266": {"Name": "Bartenstein P.", "AuthorID": "7005739266", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ludwig Maximilians University"}, "56264183100": {"Name": "Barthel H.", "AuthorID": "56264183100", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Leipzig University"}, "23095212300": {"Name": "Purz S.", "AuthorID": "23095212300", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Leipzig University"}, "7005768679": {"Name": "Sabri O.", "AuthorID": "7005768679", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Leipzig University"}, "7005258890": {"Name": "Sattler B.", "AuthorID": "7005258890", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Leipzig University"}, "8140150600": {"Name": "Beer A.", "AuthorID": "8140150600", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Neuroradiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "7006047770": {"Name": "Bluemke D.", "AuthorID": "7006047770", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Radiology and Imaging Sciences, National Institutes of Health"}, "6701854037": {"Name": "Boellaard R.", "AuthorID": "6701854037", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "36049468200": {"Name": "Claussen C.", "AuthorID": "36049468200", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Radiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "56053305000": {"Name": "G\u00fcckel B.", "AuthorID": "56053305000", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Radiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "7201833135": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4fer J.", "AuthorID": "7201833135", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Radiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "14024984100": {"Name": "Schmidt H.", "AuthorID": "14024984100", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Radiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "55971064600": {"Name": "Franzius C.", "AuthorID": "55971064600", "AffiliationID": "109533170", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Morphological and Molecular Diagnostics (ZeMoDi), MR- and PET/MRI;
