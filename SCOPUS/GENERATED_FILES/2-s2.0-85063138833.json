This study aimed to apply a more robust naturalistic stepped wedge study design to compare the prevalence and types of prescribing errors for electronic prescribing and paper prescribing. Data were collected weekly during a phased electronic prescribing implementation across 20 wards in a large English hospital. We identified 511 (7.8%) erroneous orders in 6523 paper medication orders, and 312 (6.0%) in 5237 electronic prescribing orders. Logistic regression suggested no statistically significant effect of electronic prescribing use or of study week; patient and ward had significant effects. Errors involving incorrect doses and illegible or incomplete orders were less common with electronic prescribing; those involving duplication, omission, incorrect drug and incorrect formulation were more common. Actions are needed to mitigate these error types; future studies should give more consideration to the effects of patient and ward.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electronic prescribing", "hospitals", "patient safety", "prescribing errors", "stepped wedge study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063138833", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57194222242": {"Name": "Franklin B.D.", "AuthorID": "57194222242", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57202726231": {"Name": "Puaar S.", "AuthorID": "57202726231", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
