And vice versa? From the clearing of vegetation using fire to the emergence of agriculture and beyond, human societies have increasingly sustained themselves through practices that enhance environmental productivity through ecosystem engineering. At the same time, human societies have increased in scale and complexity from mobile bands of hunter-gatherers to telecoupled world systems. We propose that these long-term changes are coupled through positive feedbacks among social and environmental changes, coevolved primarily through selection acting at the group level and above, and that this can be tested by combining archeological evidence with mechanistic experiments using an agent-based virtual laboratory (ABVL) approach. A more robust understanding of whether and how cultural multi-level selection couples human social change with environmental transformation may help in addressing the long-term sustainability challenges of the Anthropocene.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modeling (ABM)", "Anthroecology", "Archaeology", "Social\u2013ecological systems (SES)", "Sociocultural niche construction (SNC)", "The extended evolutionary synthesis (EES)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034762883", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7201898915": {"Name": "Ellis E.C.", "AuthorID": "7201898915", "AffiliationID": "60024997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environmental Systems, University of Maryland, Baltimore County"}, "26039351200": {"Name": "Magliocca N.R.", "AuthorID": "26039351200", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Alabama"}, "26034718600": {"Name": "Stevens C.J.", "AuthorID": "26034718600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
