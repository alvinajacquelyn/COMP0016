Annual review of this disease is recommended to monitor the development of complications. We aim to provide a concise, evidence-based framework to assist clinicians during this annual review. We focus on the following areas: (A) what questions need to be asked during annual review, (B) which areas need emphasis on examination, (C) when is an investigation required and (D) referral to tertiary specialists and other members of the multidisciplinary team. It should also be noted that there are ongoing debates regarding screening intervals in certain areas. These include the frequency, modality of screening and degree of intervention for astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas. This review seeks to summarise the product of the ongoing debates, and provide evidence-based suggestions in light of the uncertainty.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Humans", "Tuberous Sclerosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929620783", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56651565200": {"Name": "Ng K.H.", "AuthorID": "56651565200", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "56477893500": {"Name": "Ng S.M.", "AuthorID": "56477893500", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7403268389": {"Name": "Parker A.", "AuthorID": "7403268389", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}}
