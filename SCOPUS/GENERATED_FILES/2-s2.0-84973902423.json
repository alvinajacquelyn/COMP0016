However, as an acute vasoactive, NRB has a rapid onset of action which makes it relatively unpalatable to rats, often leading to sublethal uptake and accompanying bait shyness. A series of NRB-derived pro-toxicants (3a \u2013 i, 4a \u2013 i, and 5a \u2013 i) were prepared in an effort to \u2018mask\u2019 this acute response and improve both palatability and efficacy. Their synthesis, in vitro biological evaluation (vasocontractile response in rat vasculature, stability in selected rat media) and palatability/efficacy in Sprague\u2013Dawley, wild Norway, and wild ship rats is described. Most notably, pro-toxicant 3d was revealed to be free of all pre-cleavage vasoconstrictory activity in rat caudal artery and was subsequently demonstrated to release NRB in the presence of rat blood, liver, and pancreatic enzymes. Moreover, it consistently displayed a high level of acceptance by rats in a two-choice bait-palatability and efficacy trial, with accompanying high mortality. On this evidence, fatty acid ester prodrugs would appear to offer a promising platform for the further development of NRB-derived toxicants with enhanced palatability and efficacy profiles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Esterase", "Lipase", "Norbormide", "Prodrug", "Rat toxicant", "Rodenticide"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973902423", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57199219419": {"Name": "Choi H.", "AuthorID": "57199219419", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "26429101700": {"Name": "Conole D.", "AuthorID": "26429101700", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "35777447500": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "35777447500", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "12764435100": {"Name": "Laita O.", "AuthorID": "12764435100", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "37123948500": {"Name": "Jay-Smith M.", "AuthorID": "37123948500", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "14051418500": {"Name": "Brimble M.", "AuthorID": "14051418500", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "6603931960": {"Name": "Rennison D.", "AuthorID": "6603931960", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "7201963147": {"Name": "Pagano M.", "AuthorID": "7201963147", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "56386043200": {"Name": "Ribaudo G.", "AuthorID": "56386043200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "6603731398": {"Name": "Cavalli M.", "AuthorID": "6603731398", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "56271110200": {"Name": "Bova S.", "AuthorID": "56271110200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "7103111641": {"Name": "Hopkins B.", "AuthorID": "7103111641", "AffiliationID": "60027842, 60017806", "AffiliationName": "Landcare Research, Canterbury Agriculture and Science Centre"}}}
