Although the quantity of data is limited, it is much more than has been published before. It allows a rule of thumb to be deduced: that the bistatic radar cross section is approximately the square root of its monostatic value when both values are measured in square metres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bistatic", "radar cross section", "ship"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bistatic", "Bistatic radar cross section", "Monostatic", "Rule of thumb", "Square roots", "Ultra-high frequency"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060164530", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"6603516262": {"Name": "Stove A.", "AuthorID": "6603516262", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "16021041700": {"Name": "Antoniou M.", "AuthorID": "16021041700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "16176669000": {"Name": "Tzagkas D.", "AuthorID": "16176669000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60026242", "AffiliationName": "Radar Sensing Team, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory"}}}
