Less is known about the impact of PFI on relatives\u2019 coping strategies in BD. Methods: A multicenter, controlled, outpatient trial funded by the Italian Ministry of Health and coordinated by the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Campania \u201cLuigi Vanvitelli\u201d has been conducted in patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) and their key relatives consecutively recruited in 11 randomly selected Italian community mental health centers. We aim to test the hypothesis that PFI improves problem-oriented coping strategies in relatives of BD-I patients compared to the Treatment As Usual (TAU) group. Results: The final sample was constituted of 123 patients and 139 relatives. At baseline assessment (T0), the vast majority of relatives already adopted problem-oriented coping strategies more frequently than the emotion-focused ones. At the end of the intervention, relatives receiving PFI reported a higher endorsement of adaptive coping strategies, such as \u201cmaintenance of social interests\u201d (odds ratio [OR]=0.309, CI=0.04\u20130.57; p=0.023), \u201cpositive communication with the patient\u201d (OR=0.295, CI=0.13\u20130.46; p=0.001), and \u201csearching for information\u201d (OR=0.443, CI=0.12\u20130.76; p=0.007), compared to TAU relatives, after controlling for several confounders. As regards the emotion-focused coping strategies, relatives receiving the experimental intervention less frequently reported to adopt \u201cresignation\u201d (OR=-0.380, CI=-0.68 to -0.08; p=0.014) and \u201ccoercion\u201d (OR=-0.268, CI=-0.46 to -0.08; p=0.006) strategies, compared to TAU relatives. Conclusion: PFI is effective in improving the adaptive coping strategies of relatives of BD-I patients, but further studies are needed for evaluating the long-term benefits of this intervention.",
