Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and its unique ability to reconstruct the OR in vivo were used to study structural maturation through analysis of DTI metrics in a cohort of 90 children aged 5\u201318 years. As the OR is at risk of damage during epilepsy surgery, we measured its position relative to characteristic anatomical landmarks. Anatomical distances, DTI metrics and volume of the OR were investigated for age, gender and hemisphere effects. We observed changes in DTI metrics with age comparable to known trajectories in other white matter tracts. Left lateralization of DTI metrics was observed that showed a gender effect in lateralization. Sexual dimorphism of DTI metrics in the right hemisphere was also found. With respect to OR dimensions, volume was shown to be right lateralised and sexual dimorphism demonstrated for the extent of the left OR. The anatomical results presented for the OR have potentially important applications for neurosurgical planning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Diffusion imaging", "DTI", "Epilepsy surgery", "Lateral geniculate nucleus", "Maturation", "Meyer\u2019s loop", "Neurosurgery planning", "Optic radiation", "Probabilistic tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anisotropy", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Tract"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84886194830", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"55656808100": {"Name": "Dayan M.", "AuthorID": "55656808100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Biophysics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Biophysics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "8944994900": {"Name": "Munoz M.", "AuthorID": "8944994900", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Castilla-La Mancha"}, "57203556574": {"Name": "Cooper J.", "AuthorID": "57203556574", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"}, "14626220800": {"Name": "Jentschke S.", "AuthorID": "14626220800", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Free University, Cluster of Excellence \u201cLanguages of Emotion\u201d"}, "56219505000": {"Name": "Chadwick M.", "AuthorID": "56219505000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cognitive, Perceptual, and Brain Sciences, UCL Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience"}, "7004489148": {"Name": "Vargha-Khadem F.", "AuthorID": "7004489148", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55897134500": {"Name": "Riney K.", "AuthorID": "55897134500", "AffiliationID": "60004905", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, Mater Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
