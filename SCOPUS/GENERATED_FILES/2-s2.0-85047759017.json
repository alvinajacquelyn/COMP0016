The excitation spectra have been investigated through the MIT by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Os L3 edge. Low resolution (\u0394E\u223c300meV) measurements over a wide range of energies reveal that local electronic excitations do not change appreciably through the MIT. This is consistent with a picture in which structural distortions do not drive the MIT. In contrast, high resolution (\u0394E\u223c56meV) measurements show that the well-defined, low-energy magnons in the insulating state weaken and dampen upon approaching the metallic state. Concomitantly, a broad continuum of excitations develops which is well described by the magnetic fluctuations of a nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid. By revealing the continuous evolution of the magnetic quasiparticle spectrum as it changes its character from itinerant to localized, our results provide unprecedented insight into the nature of the MIT in NaOsO3. In particular, the presence of weak correlations in the paramagnetic phase implies a degree of departure from the ideal Slater limit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047759017", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56735783700": {"Name": "Vale J.G.", "AuthorID": "56735783700", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Quantum Magnetism, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "55650461200": {"Name": "Donnerer C.", "AuthorID": "55650461200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56545670200": {"Name": "Pincini D.", "AuthorID": "56545670200", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7005535111": {"Name": "McMorrow D.F.", "AuthorID": "7005535111", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54884227900": {"Name": "Calder S.", "AuthorID": "54884227900", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Neutron Scattering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "54790575400": {"Name": "Christianson A.D.", "AuthorID": "54790575400", "AffiliationID": "60015574", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Tennessee"}, "8251441000": {"Name": "Shi Y.G.", "AuthorID": "8251441000", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Functional Materials, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "35520254400": {"Name": "Tsujimoto Y.", "AuthorID": "35520254400", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Functional Materials, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "7004349948": {"Name": "Yamaura K.", "AuthorID": "7004349948", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "26537759700": {"Name": "Moretti Sala M.", "AuthorID": "26537759700", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF, European Synchrotron"}, "7005818514": {"Name": "Van Den Brink J.", "AuthorID": "7005818514", "AffiliationID": "60007746", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Solid State Physics, IFW Dresden"}}}
