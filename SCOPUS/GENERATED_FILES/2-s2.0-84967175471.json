We have previously shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be labeled with SPIONs with no effect on cell proliferation or survival and that within an hour of systemic administration, they migrate to and integrate into tumors in vivo. Here, we report on some longer term (up to 3 weeks) post-integration characteristics of magnetically labeled human MSCs in an immunocompromized mouse model. We initially assessed how the size and coating of SPIONs dictated the loading capacity and cellular heating of MSCs. Ferucarbotran\u00ae was the best of those tested, having the best like-for-like heating capability and being the only one to retain that capability after cell internalization. A mouse model was created by subcutaneous flank injection of a combination of 0.5 million Ferucarbotran-loaded MSCs and 1.0 million OVCAR-3 ovarian tumor cells. After 2 weeks, the tumors reached ~100 \u00b5L in volume and then entered a rapid growth phase over the third week to reach ~300 \u00b5L. In the control mice that received no AMF treatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data showed that the labeled MSCs were both incorporated into and retained within the tumors over the entire 3-week period. In the AMF-treated mice, heat increases of ~4\u00b0C were observed during the first application, after which MRI indicated a loss of negative contrast, suggesting that the MSCs had died and been cleared from the tumor. This post-AMF removal of cells was confirmed by histological examination and also by a reduced level of subsequent magnetic heating effect. Despite this evidence for an AMF-elicited response in the SPION-loaded MSCs, and in contrast to previous reports on tumor remission in immunocompetent mouse models, in this case, no significant differences were measured regarding the overall tumor size or growth characteristics. We discuss the implications of these results on the clinical delivery of hyperthermia therapy to tumors and on the possibility that a preferred therapeutic route may involve AMF as an adjuvant to an autologous immune response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hyperthermia", "Mesenchymal stem cells", "MRI", "SPIONs", "Tumor therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Contrast Media", "Dextrans", "Female", "Humans", "Hyperthermia, Induced", "Magnetic Fields", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Magnetite Nanoparticles", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Mice, Nude", "Neoplasms, Experimental"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967175471", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "44761490900": {"Name": "Ordidge K.", "AuthorID": "44761490900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "17135062600": {"Name": "Loebinger M.", "AuthorID": "17135062600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56997607700": {"Name": "Kyrtatos P.", "AuthorID": "56997607700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "26432363000": {"Name": "Southern P.", "AuthorID": "26432363000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}}}
