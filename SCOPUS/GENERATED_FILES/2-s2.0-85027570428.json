Risks for many of the major NCDs are associated with the production, marketing and consumption of commercially produced food and drink, particularly those containing sugar, salt and transfats (in ultra-processed products), alcohol and tobacco. The problems inherent in primary prevention of NCDs have received relatively little attention from international organizations, national governments and civil society, especially when compared to the attention paid to secondary and tertiary prevention regimes (i.e. those focused on provision of medical treatment and long-term clinical management). This may in part reflect that until recently the NCDs have not been deemed a priority on the overall global health agenda. Low political priority may also be due in part to the complexity inherent in implementing feasible and acceptable interventions, such as increased taxation or regulation of access, particularly given the need to coordinate action beyond the health sector. More fundamentally, governing determinants of risk frequently brings public health into conflict with the interests of profit-driven food, beverage, alcohol and tobacco industries. Materials: We use a conceptual framework to review three models of governance of NCD risk: self-regulation by industry; hybrid models of public-private engagement; and public sector regulation. We analyse the challenges inherent in each model, and review what is known (or not) about their impact on NCD outcomes. Conclusion: While piecemeal efforts have been established, we argue that mechanisms to control the commercial determinants of NCDs are inadequate and efforts at remedial action too limited. Our paper sets out an agenda to strengthen each of the three governance models. We identify reforms that will be needed to the global health architecture to govern NCD risks, including to strengthen its ability to consolidate the collective power of diverse stakeholders, its authority to develop and enforce clear measures to address risks, as well as establish monitoring and rights-based accountability systems across all actors to drive measurable, equitable and sustainable progress in reducing the global burden of NCDs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Commercial drivers", "NCD governance", "Partnership", "Public-private regulation", "Self-regulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Disease", "Commerce", "Communicable Diseases", "Government Agencies", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Noncommunicable Diseases", "Public Health", "Risk", "Tobacco Industry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027570428", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35899779000": {"Name": "Buse K.", "AuthorID": "35899779000", "AffiliationID": "60009752", "AffiliationName": "UNAIDS"}, "55979473100": {"Name": "Tanaka S.", "AuthorID": "55979473100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005237779": {"Name": "Hawkes S.", "AuthorID": "7005237779", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
