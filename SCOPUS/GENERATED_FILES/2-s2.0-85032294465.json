It can present as an isolated problem (IGHD) or in combination with other pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD). Pituitary deficits can evolve at any time from GHD diagnosis. The number, severity and timing of occurrence of additional endocrinopathies are highly variable. The risk of progression from IGHD to CPHD in children varies depending on the etiology (idiopathic vs organic). The highest risk is displayed by children with abnormalities in the Hypothalamo-Pituitary (H-P) region. Heterogeneous data have been reported on the type and timing of onset of additional pituitary hormone deficits, with TSH deficiency being most frequent and Diabetes Insipidus the least frequent additional deficit in the majority, but not all, of the studies. ACTH deficiency may gradually evolve at any time during follow-up in children or adults with childhood onset IGHD, particularly (but not only) in presence of H-P abnormalities and/or TSH deficiency. Hence there is a need in these patients for lifelong monitoring for ACTH deficiency. GH treatment unmasks central hypothyroidism mainly in patients with organic GHD, but all patients starting GH should have their thyroid function monitored closely. Main risk factors for development of CPHD include organic etiology, H-P abnormalities (in particular pituitary stalk abnormalities, empty sella and ectopic posterior pituitary), midline brain (corpus callosum) and optic nerves abnormalities, genetic defects and longer duration of follow-up. The current available evidence supports longstanding recommendations for the need, in all patients diagnosed with IGHD, of a careful and indefinite follow-up for additional pituitary hormone deficiencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combined pituitary hormone deficiency", "Evolution", "Isolated growth hormone deficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adrenal Insufficiency", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Corpus Callosum", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Human Growth Hormone", "Humans", "Hypopituitarism", "Male", "Phenotype", "Pituitary Gland", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032294465", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"35329107200": {"Name": "Cerbone M.", "AuthorID": "35329107200", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, UCL Institute of Child Health and Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, UCL Institute of Child Health and Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
