Methods: A next-generation sequencing assay was developed to detect ten common CF mutations for exclusion of the paternal mutation in maternal plasma. Using uptake data from a study exploring views on NIPD for CF, total test-related costs were estimated for the current care pathway and compared with those incorporating NIPD. Results: The assay reliably predicted mutation status in all control and maternal plasma samples. Of carrier or affected adults with CF (n=142) surveyed, only 43.5% reported willingness to have invasive testing for CF with 94.4% saying they would have NIPD. Using these potential uptake data, the incremental costs of NIPD over invasive testing per 100 pregnancies at risk of CF are \u00a39025 for paternal mutation exclusion, and \u00a326510 for direct diagnosis. Conclusions: We have developed NIPD for risk stratification in around a third of CF families. There are economic implications due to potential increased test demand to inform postnatal management rather than to inform decisions around termination of an affected pregnancy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Costs and Cost Analysis", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Female", "Heterozygote Detection", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Maternal Serum Screening Tests", "Mutation", "Patient Preference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943348860", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7404448261": {"Name": "Hill M.", "AuthorID": "7404448261", "AffiliationID": "101110271", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "25822876800": {"Name": "Twiss P.", "AuthorID": "25822876800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23027459500": {"Name": "Drury S.", "AuthorID": "23027459500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204295860": {"Name": "Mckay F.", "AuthorID": "57204295860", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57208066633": {"Name": "Mason S.", "AuthorID": "57208066633", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9535391900": {"Name": "Jenkins L.", "AuthorID": "9535391900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "101110271", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "36093643600": {"Name": "Verhoef T.I.", "AuthorID": "36093643600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
