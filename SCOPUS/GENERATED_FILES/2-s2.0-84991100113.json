In vivo, A\u03b2 aggregation and plaque formation occur in the interstitial fluid of the brain extracellular matrix. This fluid communicates freely with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here, we examined the effect of human CSF on A\u03b2 aggregation kinetics in relation to AD diagnosis and carrier status of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele, the main genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. The aggregation of A\u03b2 was inhibited in the presence of CSF and, surprisingly, the effect was more pronounced in APOE \u03b54 carriers. However, by fractionation of CSF using size exclusion chromatography, it became evident that it was not the ApoE protein itself that conveyed the inhibition, since the retarding species eluted at lower volume, corresponding to a much higher molecular weight, than ApoE monomers. Cholesterol quantification and immunoblotting identified high-density lipoprotein particles in the retarding fractions, indicating that such particles may be responsible for the inhibition. These results add information to the yet unresolved puzzle on how the risk factor of APOE \u03b54 functions in AD pathogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Apolipoprotein \u03b54", "Cholesterol", "High density lipoproteins", "Inhibition", "Kinetics", "Neurofibrillary tangles", "Thioflavin T"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Chromatography, Gel", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Kinetics", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Prospective Studies", "Protein Multimerization", "Thiazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991100113", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"53880212700": {"Name": "Padayachee E.R.", "AuthorID": "53880212700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Lab, Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Lab, Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Lab, Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Lab, Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "57203198460": {"Name": "Bor\u00e9n J.", "AuthorID": "57203198460", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701588028": {"Name": "Molinuevo J.L.", "AuthorID": "6701588028", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Neurology Service, ICN Hospital Clinic i Universitari and Pasqual Maragall Foundation"}, "7102011511": {"Name": "Andreasen N.", "AuthorID": "7102011511", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatrics, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "35619990500": {"Name": "Cukalevski R.", "AuthorID": "35619990500", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "7004924118": {"Name": "Linse S.", "AuthorID": "7004924118", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}}}
