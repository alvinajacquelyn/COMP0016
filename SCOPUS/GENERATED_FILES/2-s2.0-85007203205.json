From a valuation perspective, environmental problems and conflicts originate from trade-offs between values. The urgency and importance to integrate nature's diverse values in decisions and actions stand out more than ever. Valuation, in its broad sense of \u2018assigning importance\u2019, is inherently part of most decisions on natural resource and land use. Scholars from different traditions -while moving from heuristic interdisciplinary debate to applied transdisciplinary science- now acknowledge the need for combining multiple disciplines and methods to represent the diverse set of values of nature. This growing group of scientists and practitioners share the ambition to explore how combinations of ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation tools can support real-life resource and land use decision-making. The current sustainability challenges and the ineffectiveness of single-value approaches to offer relief demonstrate that continuing along a single path is no option. We advocate for the adherence of a plural valuation culture and its establishment as a common practice, by contesting and complementing ineffective and discriminatory single-value approaches. In policy and decision contexts with a willingness to improve sustainability, integrated valuation approaches can be blended in existing processes, whereas in contexts of power asymmetries or environmental conflicts, integrated valuation can promote the inclusion of diverse values through action research and support the struggle for social and environmental justice. The special issue and this editorial synthesis paper bring together lessons from pioneer case studies and research papers, synthesizing main challenges and setting out priorities for the years to come for the field of integrated valuation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benefits of nature", "Decision support", "Ecosystem services", "Integrated valuation", "Intrinsic value", "Participation", "Quality of life", "Social and environmental justice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007203205", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"35077087200": {"Name": "Jacobs S.", "AuthorID": "35077087200", "AffiliationID": "60068586", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Nature and Society, Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)"}, "25629764100": {"Name": "Turkelboom F.", "AuthorID": "25629764100", "AffiliationID": "60068586", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Nature and Society, Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)"}, "6508175025": {"Name": "Dendoncker N.", "AuthorID": "6508175025", "AffiliationID": "60006635", "AffiliationName": "University of Namur, Department of Geography"}, "56197716600": {"Name": "Pipart N.", "AuthorID": "56197716600", "AffiliationID": "60006635", "AffiliationName": "University of Namur, Department of Geography"}, "55807401700": {"Name": "Brogna D.", "AuthorID": "55807401700", "AffiliationID": "60006635", "AffiliationName": "University of Namur, Department of Geography"}, "23028283000": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn-L\u00f3pez B.", "AuthorID": "23028283000", "AffiliationID": "60072202", "AffiliationName": "Leuphana University, Faculty of Sustainability, Institute of Ethics and Transdisciplinary Sustainability Research"}, "24175588700": {"Name": "Gomez-Baggethun E.", "AuthorID": "24175588700", "AffiliationID": "60020071", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA)"}, "11939299400": {"Name": "Barton D.N.", "AuthorID": "11939299400", "AffiliationID": "60020071", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA)"}, "56928414700": {"Name": "Boeraeve F.", "AuthorID": "56928414700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "TERRA -
