Current interventions concentrate on targeting the placental ischaemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress associated with an imbalance in angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors. Recent meta-analyses confirm that aspirin modestly reduces the risk for small-for-gestational-age pregnancy in high-risk women. A dose of \u2265100 mg starting by 16 weeks of gestation is recommended. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that low-molecular-weight heparin may prevent FGR; further research is needed to confirm efficacy. Once FGR is diagnosed, no treatment will improve foetal growth. Potential FGR therapies such as phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors or maternal VEGF gene therapy aim to improve poor placentation and/or uterine blood flow. Melatonin, creatine and N-acetyl cysteine have potential as novel neuroprotective and cardioprotective agents in FGR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aspirin", "Foetal growth restriction", "Low-molecular-weight heparin", "Pre-eclampsia", "Pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticoagulants", "Aspirin", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors", "Female", "Fetal Growth Retardation", "Gestational Age", "Healthy Diet", "Heparin", "Humans", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Risk Factors", "Uterus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045269820", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57073740600": {"Name": "Nawathe A.", "AuthorID": "57073740600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Medicine Unit, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Research & Development"}}}
