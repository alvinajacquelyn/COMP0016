In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has set criteria for selection of patients for DHC in MMCAI. We set out to survey the attitudes and practice of neurosurgeons and stroke physicians within the United Kingdom towards DHC in MMCAI. Methods An electronic survey of questions on management of MMCAI in various clinical scenarios was submitted to the academic committees of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the British Association of Stroke Physicians for approval before dissemination through the consultant members. Responses were collected over 2 months. Results A total of 78 responses, from 51 neurosurgeons and 27 stroke physicians, were included in final analysis. A total of 54% and 24% of all respondents would recommend DHC in patients aged 60\u201370 and 70\u201380 years, respectively; 60% would advocate surgery between 48 and 72 hours and 27% beyond 72 hours. A total of 36% indicated DHC with preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale 15/15. These findings do not conform to current NICE guidelines. Stroke physicians were statistically more likely to recommend DHC in patients older than 60 years (P = 0.032) and in those with dominant multiterritorial infarcts (P = 0.042) and accept a greater postoperative modified Rankin Scale (P = 0.034) compared with neurosurgeons. Conclusions In view of evidence from recent trials and differences in NICE guidelines and current clinical practice within the United Kingdom, based on our survey results, it is important to reevaluate NICE guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decompressive hemicraniectomy", "Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction", "National survey", "Neurosurgeons", "NICE guidelines", "Stroke physicians"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Decompressive Craniectomy", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Glasgow Coma Scale", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurosurgeons", "Physicians", "Stroke", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017383821", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57193891571": {"Name": "Basu P.", "AuthorID": "57193891571", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "57193206524": {"Name": "Jenkins H.", "AuthorID": "57193206524", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "57075824600": {"Name": "Tsang K.", "AuthorID": "57075824600", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "54954062300": {"Name": "Vakharia V.N.", "AuthorID": "54954062300", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}}}
