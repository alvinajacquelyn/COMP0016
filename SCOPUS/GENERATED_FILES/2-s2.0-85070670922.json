Therefore, a huge number of possible scenarios must be relevant for the real event. For advanced structural safety studies that involve refined computations and physical model testing, it is essential to select a set of realistic scenarios which must represent all the possible events but with a limited number which is needed to minimize the computational costs. This chapter presents practical methods to select a set of realistic scenarios but with a limited number by making use of probabilistic sampling techniques. The selected scenarios shall be used for advanced structural safety studies associated with limit states and risks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070670922", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
