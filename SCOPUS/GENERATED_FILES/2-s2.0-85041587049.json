In this study, the Trp53 status and functional response to Nutlin-3 and ionising radiation (IR) were determined in 6 adherent TH-MYCN transgenic cell lines using Sanger sequencing, western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Sensitivity to structurally diverse MDM2 inhibitors (Nutlin-3, MI-63, RG7388 and NDD0005) was determined using XTT proliferation assays. In total, 2/6 cell lines were Trp53 homozygous mutant (NHO2A and 844MYCN+/+) and 1/6 (282MYCN+/-) was Trp53 heterozygous mutant. For 1/6 cell lines (NHO2A), DNA from the corresponding primary tumour was found to be Trp53 wt. In all cases, the presence of a mutation was consistent with aberrant p53 signalling in response to Nutlin-3 and IR. In comparison to TP53 wt human neuroblastoma cells, Trp53 wt murine control and TH-MYCN cell lines were significantly less sensitive to growth inhibition mediated by MI-63 and RG7388. These murine Trp53 wt and mutant TH-MYCN cell lines are useful syngeneic, immunocompetent neuroblastoma models, the former to test p53-dependent therapies in combination with immunotherapies, such as anti-GD2, and the latter as models of chemoresistant relapsed neuroblastoma when aberrations in the p53 pathway are more common. The spontaneous development of Trp53 mutations in 3 cell lines from TH-MYCN mice may have arisen from MYCN oncogenic driven and/or ex vivo selection. The identified species-dependent selectivity of MI-63 and RG7388 should be considered when interpreting in vivo toxicity studies of MDM2 inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MDM2 inhibitors", "MI-63", "NDD0005", "Neuroblastoma", "Nutlin-3", "P53 pathway", "RG7388", "TH-MYCN"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Imidazoles", "Indoles", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein", "Neuroblastoma", "para-Aminobenzoates", "Piperazines", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2", "Pyrrolidines", "Radiation, Ionizing", "Signal Transduction", "Spiro Compounds", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041587049", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"23033789700": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "23033789700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Herschel Building"}, "57200548315": {"Name": "Reaves W.", "AuthorID": "57200548315", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Herschel Building"}, "6701720218": {"Name": "Tweddle D.A.", "AuthorID": "6701720218", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Herschel Building"}, "57188958306": {"Name": "Esfandiari A.", "AuthorID": "57188958306", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University"}, "7005709885": {"Name": "Lunec J.", "AuthorID": "7005709885", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University"}, "55220545000": {"Name": "Vu A.", "AuthorID": "55220545000", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "57208171054": {"Name": "Hogarty M.D.", "AuthorID": "57208171054", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}}}
