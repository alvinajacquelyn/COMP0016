The aim of this study was to assess the general and oral HRQoL of oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients 6 or more months after treatment and compare them with a population free from this disease. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out with patients treated for oral cancer at least 6 months post-treatment and a gender and age group matched control group. HRQoL was measured with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); oral HRQoL (OHRQoL) was evaluated using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP). Multivariable regression models assessed the association between the outcomes (SF-12, OHIP-14 and OIDP) and the exposure (patients versus controls), adjusting for sex, age, social class, functional tooth units and presence of illness. Results: For patients (n = 142) and controls (n = 142), 64.1% were males. The mean age was 65.2 (standard deviation (sd): 12.9) years in patients and 67.5 (sd: 13.7) years in controls. Patients had worse SF-12 Physical Component Summary scores than controls even in fully the adjusted model [\u03b2-coefficient = -0.11 (95% CI: -5.12-(-0.16)]. The differences in SF-12 Mental Component Summary were not statistically significant. Regarding OHRQoL patients had 11.63 (95% CI: 6.77-20.01) higher odds for the OHIP-14 and 21.26 (95% CI: 11.54-39.13) higher odds for OIDP of being in a worse category of OHRQoL compared to controls in the fully adjusted model. Conclusion: At least 6 months after treatment, oral cancer patients had worse OHRQoL, worse physical HRQoL and similar psychological HRQoL than the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["OHIP", "OIDP", "Oral cancer", "Quality of life", "SF-12"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude to Health", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Oral Health", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938909260", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57218437588": {"Name": "Barrios R.", "AuthorID": "57218437588", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Preventive and Community Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Granada"}, "55836792800": {"Name": "Bravo M.", "AuthorID": "55836792800", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Preventive and Community Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Granada"}, "6602316609": {"Name": "Gil-Montoya J.A.", "AuthorID": "6602316609", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Special Care in Dentistry and Gerodontology, School of Dentistry, University of Granada"}, "6508216423": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Lara I.", "AuthorID": "6508216423", "AffiliationID": "60018826", "AffiliationName": "Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, Servicio de Cirug\u00eda Maxilofacial, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"}, "45461110800": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Medina B.", "AuthorID": "45461110800", "AffiliationID": "60018826", "AffiliationName": "Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, Servicio de Cirug\u00eda Maxilofacial, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dental Public Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health, University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
