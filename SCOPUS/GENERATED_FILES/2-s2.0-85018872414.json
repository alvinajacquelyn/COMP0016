However, we lack knowledge of the population structure and how self-renewal and de novo influx contribute to the maintenance of memory compartments. Here, we characterise the kinetics and structure of murine CD4 T cell memory subsets by measuring the rates of influx of new cells and using detailed timecourses of DNA labelling that also distinguish the behaviour of recently divided and quiescent cells. We find that both effector and central memory CD4 T cells comprise subpopulations with highly divergent rates of turnover, and show that inflows of new cells sourced from the naive pool strongly impact estimates of memory cell lifetimes and division rates. We also demonstrate that the maintenance of CD4 T cell memory subsets in healthy mice is unexpectedly and strikingly reliant on this replenishment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Immunologic Memory", "Mice", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018872414", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57006602000": {"Name": "Gossel G.", "AuthorID": "57006602000", "AffiliationID": "60002896, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Hunter College, City University of New York"}, "35791457200": {"Name": "Cownden D.", "AuthorID": "35791457200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences University of Glasgow"}, "35742438800": {"Name": "Yates A.", "AuthorID": "35742438800", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences University of Glasgow"}, "18041591000": {"Name": "Hogan T.", "AuthorID": "18041591000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7006500719": {"Name": "Seddon B.", "AuthorID": "7006500719", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}}}
