It serves important roles in physiology by sculpting complex tissues during embryogenesis and by removing effete cells that have reached advanced age or whose genomes have been irreparably damaged. Apoptosis culminates in the rapid and decisive removal of cell corpses by efferocytosis, a term used to distinguish the engulfment of apoptotic cells from other phagocytic processes. Over the past decades, the molecular and cell biological events associated with efferocytosis have been rigorously studied, and many eat-me signals and receptors have been identified. The externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is arguably the most emblematic eat-me signal that is in turn bound by a large number of serum proteins and opsonins that facilitate efferocytosis. Under physiological conditions, externalized PS functions as a dominant and evolutionarily conserved immunosuppressive signal that promotes tolerance and prevents local and systemic immune activation. Pathologically, the innate immunosuppressive effect of externalized PS has been hijacked by numerous viruses, microorganisms, and parasites to facilitate infection, and in many cases, establish infection latency. PS is also profoundly dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment and antagonizes the development of tumor immunity. In this review, we discuss the biology of PS with respect to its role as a global immunosuppressive signal and how PS is exploited to drive diverse pathological processes such as infection and cancer. Finally, we outline the rationale that agents targeting PS could have significant value in cancer and infectious disease therapeutics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Apoptosis", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Autoimmunity", "Communicable Diseases", "Humans", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Neoplasms", "Phosphatidylserines", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959222190", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7006304072": {"Name": "Birge R.", "AuthorID": "7006304072", "AffiliationID": "60005292, 60005208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University Hospital Cancer Center, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School"}, "57201973570": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57201973570", "AffiliationID": "60005292, 60005208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University Hospital Cancer Center, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School"}, "55587603300": {"Name": "Calianese D.", "AuthorID": "55587603300", "AffiliationID": "60005292, 60005208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University Hospital Cancer Center, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School"}, "56222403300": {"Name": "Boeltz S.", "AuthorID": "56222403300", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine 3-Rheumatology and Immunology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), University Hospital Erlangen"}, "7003435673": {"Name": "Schett G.", "AuthorID": "7003435673", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine 3-Rheumatology and Immunology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), University Hospital Erlangen"}, "7201819676": {"Name": "Herrmann M.", "AuthorID": "7201819676", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine 3-Rheumatology and Immunology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), University Hospital Erlangen"}, "57141644600": {"Name": "Carlson J.", "AuthorID": "57141644600", "AffiliationID": "113181575", "AffiliationName": "Peregrine Pharmaceuticals"}, "57142012500": {"Name": "Hutchins J.", "AuthorID": "57142012500", "AffiliationID": "113181575", "AffiliationName": "Peregrine Pharmaceuticals"}, "6602121300": {"Name": "Freimark B.", "AuthorID": "6602121300", "AffiliationID": "113181575", "AffiliationName": "Peregrine Pharmaceuticals"}, "57142397300": {"Name": "Empig C.", "AuthorID": "57142397300", "AffiliationID": "113181575", "AffiliationName": "Peregrine Pharmaceuticals"}, "55317378200": {"Name": "Wanderley J.", "AuthorID": "55317378200", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"}, "7003296577": {"Name": "Barcinski M.", "AuthorID": "7003296577", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Biologia Celular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz"}, "6603804348": {"Name": "Brekken R.", "AuthorID": "6603804348", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695, 60009415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7410245196": {"Name": "Huang X.", "AuthorID": "7410245196", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695, 60009415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center"}, "57212237888": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "57212237888", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7006611132": {"Name": "Schroit A.", "AuthorID": "7006611132", "AffiliationID": "60092486, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Simmons Cancer Center, Department of Immunology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}}}
