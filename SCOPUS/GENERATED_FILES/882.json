All rights reserved.In this chapter, the isolation of primary mouse hepatocytes and their response to chemical treatment are described. We show that it is important to consider, in the experimental design, the sex of the animals to be used. We demonstrate this by measuring the effect of sex hormones or xenobiotics on the expression of fl avin-containing monooxygenase 5 in cultures of primary hepatocytes isolated from male and female mice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hormones", "Mouse hepatocyte isolation", "Mouse hepatocyte viability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Separation", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hepatocytes", "Male", "Mice"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955405156", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"55835744900": {"Name": "Houseman L.", "AuthorID": "55835744900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural, Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7402850232": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "7402850232", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural, Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57206407951": {"Name": "Phillips I.", "AuthorID": "57206407951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural, Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56425678900": {"Name": "Shephard E.", "AuthorID": "56425678900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural, Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
