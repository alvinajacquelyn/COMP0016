Quantifying the genetic effects of the 3 loci would specifically address the benefits of HbF increases in patients. Here,wehave applied statistical methods using the most representative variants: rs1427407 and rs6545816 in BCL11A, rs66650371 (3-bp deletion) and rs9376090 in HMIP-2A, rs9494142 and rs9494145 in HMIP-2B, and rs7482144 (Xmn1-HBG2 in the \u03b2-globin locus) to create g(HbF), a genetic quantitative variable for HbF in SCD. Only patients aged \u22655 years with complete genotype and HbF data were studied. Five hundred eighty-one patients with hemoglobin SS (HbSS) or HbS\u03b20 thalassemia formed the \"discovery\" cohort. Multiple linear regression modeling rationalized the 7 variants down to 4 markers (rs6545816, rs1427407, rs66650371, and rs7482144) each independently contributing HbF-boosting alleles, together accounting for 21.8% of HbF variability (r2) in the HbSS or HbS\u03b20 patients. The model was replicated with consistent r2 in 2 different cohorts: 27.5% in HbSC patients (N 5 186) and 23% in 994 Tanzanian HbSS patients. g(HbF), our 4-variant model, provides a robust approach to account for the genetic component of HbF in SCD and is of potential utility in sickle genetic and clinical studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "England", "Fetal Hemoglobin", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Hemoglobin, Sickle", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Models, Genetic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053472092", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"57190060772": {"Name": "Gardner K.", "AuthorID": "57190060772", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS), Foundation Trust"}, "57198179278": {"Name": "Silver N.", "AuthorID": "57198179278", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Red Cell Biology Programme, Rayne Institute"}, "22035945300": {"Name": "Rooks H.", "AuthorID": "22035945300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Red Cell Biology Programme, Rayne Institute"}, "57218391795": {"Name": "Angelis N.", "AuthorID": "57218391795", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Red Cell Biology Programme, Rayne Institute"}, "57203104735": {"Name": "Rees D.C.", "AuthorID": "57203104735", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS), Foundation Trust"}, "56844970200": {"Name": "Menzel S.", "AuthorID": "56844970200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Red Cell Biology Programme, Rayne Institute"}, "55954889600": {"Name": "Thein S.L.", "AuthorID": "55954889600", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS), Foundation Trust"}, "36186618500": {"Name": "Allman M.", "AuthorID": "36186618500", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS), Foundation Trust"}, "57205460835": {"Name": "Stuart-Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57205460835", "AffiliationID": "60176725", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust"}, "8562039100": {"Name": "Awogbade M.", "AuthorID": "8562039100", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS), Foundation Trust"}, "6507164711": {"Name": "Fulford T.", "AuthorID": "6507164711", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Ecology, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "36984246500": {"Name": "Nkya S.", "AuthorID": "36984246500", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "57200801395": {"Name": "Makani J.", "AuthorID": "57200801395", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "35071951600": {"Name": "Sangeda R.Z.", "AuthorID": "35071951600", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "35488523100": {"Name": "Mgaya J.", "AuthorID": "35488523100", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "23024734900": {"Name": "Howard J.", "AuthorID": "23024734900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6504693053": {"Name": "Kesse-Adu R.", "AuthorID": "6504693053", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507819503": {"Name": "Yeghen T.", "AuthorID": "6507819503", "AffiliationID": "60001497, 60176725", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Lewisham, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust"}, "57196028662": {"Name": "Patel H.", "AuthorID": "57196028662", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College"}, "57213081499": {"Name": "Newhouse S.", "AuthorID": "57213081499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
