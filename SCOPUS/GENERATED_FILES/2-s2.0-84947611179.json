The article will focus on the development and implementation of a viable workflow for the production of high-quality 3D models of museum objects, based on the 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry of selected ancient Egyptian artefacts. The development of a robust protocol for the complete process chain for imaging cultural heritage artefacts, from the acquisition of 2D and/or 3D images to the development of interactive applications for the public audience. Was A Specific Objective of the Proj.. the Workflow Devised by the Univ. Mus. Team Combines Ref. Photography and 3D Imaging with A Curatorial Rev. of the Actual Object to Its Digit. Counterpart. It Also Integrates Methodologies for Mng. the Accompanying Metadatasets to Record These Activities. As Final Stage Deliverables from the Proc., the Mus. is Making High-Qual. 3D Images of Artefacts from Its Collec. Available Through Creation and Dissemination of Digit. 3D Multiplatform Interactive Applic. in Order to Allow Remote Access and to Enhance the Mus.'s Pub. Engagement.
