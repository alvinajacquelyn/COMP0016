However, it is a priori unclear which contributions make more of an impact. Here, we examine stacked polyglutamine (polyQ) strands, a peptide repeat often found in amyloid aggregates. We investigate the role of hydrogen bond (HB) cooperativity, van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions, and quantum contributions to free energies, including anharmonicities through density functional theory and ab initio path integral simulations. Of these various factors, we find that the largest impact on structural stabilization comes from vdW interactions. HB cooperativity is the second largest contribution as the size of the stacked chain grows. Competing nuclear quantum effects make the net quantum contribution small but very sensitive to anharmonicities, vdW, and the number of HBs. Our results suggest that a reliable treatment of these systems can only be attained by considering all of these components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloid", "cooperativity", "electronic structure", "polyglutamine", "van der Waals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio path integral simulation", "amyloid", "Cooperativity", "Hydrogen bond cooperativity", "Nuclear quantum effects", "Polyglutamine", "Structural stabilization", "Van der waals", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Peptides", "Protein Conformation", "Quantum Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946552261", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57214957648": {"Name": "Rossi M.", "AuthorID": "57214957648", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "St. Edmund Hall"}, "56949706600": {"Name": "Fang W.", "AuthorID": "56949706600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
