Study design and methods: The Epidemiology and Survival of Transfusion Recipients (EASTR) Study was a multi-centre epidemiological study with prospective survival monitoring. Cross-sectional sampling of adult and paediatric transfusion recipients in 29 hospitals was used to select three separate cohorts of red cell (RBC), platelet (PLT) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) recipients between October 2001 and September 2002. This paper presents the analysis of results for children <16 years. Results: Children <16 years comprised 449 (5%) of the RBC, 362 (9%) of the FFP and 452 (13%) of the PLT recipients. In children 54% of RBC, 63% FFP and 45% PLT recipients were under 1 year of age and 57% RBC, 60% FFP and 52% PLT were male. Median (IQR) DEduring the study year was 3(2-8); 5(2-13) and 11(6-21) in the RBC, FFP and PLT cohorts, respectively. A total of 20% of RBC, 31% of FFP and 54% of PLT recipients had been exposed to >10 donors. Perinatal conditions were the commonest indication for transfusion in the RBC (36%) and FFP (44%) cohorts and comprised 31% of the PLT cohort. Medical conditions (48%), predominantly malignancy (33%), were the most frequent indication in the PLT cohort. The 10 year (95% CI) survival rates were 81% (77-85%), 72% (67-76%) and 71% (66-75%)for RBC, FFP and PLT cohorts, respectively. Conclusions: Around half of paediatric transfusion recipients are under 1 year of age. Exposure to components from multiple donors is common. At least 70% of paediatric recipients are long survivors and are at risk for late complications of transfusion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood transfusion", "Epidemiology", "Paediatric", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Blood Component Transfusion", "Blood Donors", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960379681", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7103279964": {"Name": "Morley S.L.", "AuthorID": "7103279964", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Blood Centre, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "57162357500": {"Name": "Hudson C.L.", "AuthorID": "57162357500", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Blood Centre, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "6602099128": {"Name": "Llewelyn C.A.", "AuthorID": "6602099128", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Blood Centre, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "35996461200": {"Name": "Williamson L.M.", "AuthorID": "35996461200", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Blood Centre, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "7202098046": {"Name": "Wells A.W.", "AuthorID": "7202098046", "AffiliationID": "60025263", "AffiliationName": "Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"}, "57198945382": {"Name": "Johnson A.L.", "AuthorID": "57198945382", "AffiliationID": "60030968, 60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, NHS Blood and Transplant"}}}
