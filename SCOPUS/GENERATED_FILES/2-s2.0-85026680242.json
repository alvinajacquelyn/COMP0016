Departments would benefit from understanding which characteristics of feedback support effective quality monitoring, professional behaviour change and service improvement. This study aimed to report the experience of anaesthetists participating in a long-term initiative to provide comprehensive personalized feedback to consultants on patient-reported quality of recovery indicators in a large London teaching hospital. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 consultant anaesthetists, six surgical nursing leads, the theatre manager and the clinical coordinator for recovery. Transcripts were qualitatively analysed for themes linked to the perceived value of the initiative, its acceptability and its effects upon professional practice. Results: Analysis of qualitative data from participant interviews suggested that effective quality indicators must address areas that are within the control of the anaesthetist. Graphical data presentation, both longitudinal (personal variation over time) and comparative (peer-group distributions), was found to be preferable to summary statistics and provided useful and complementary perspectives for improvement. Developing trust in the reliability and credibility of the data through co-development of data reports with clinical input into areas such as case-mix adjustment was important for engagement. Making feedback specifically relevant to the recipient supported professional learning within a supportive and open collaborative environment. Conclusions: This study investigated the requirements for effective feedback on quality of anaesthetic care for anaesthetists, highlighting the mechanisms by which feedback may translate into improvements in practice at the individual and peer-group level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Patient safety", "Patient satisfaction", "Patient-reported outcomes", "Perioperative care", "Quality improvement", "Quality indicators", "Quality of recovery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anesthetists", "Clinical Competence", "Feedback", "Humans", "Quality Indicators, Health Care", "Quality of Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026680242", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57191813530": {"Name": "D'Lima D.", "AuthorID": "57191813530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "18633472700": {"Name": "Arnold G.", "AuthorID": "18633472700", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57205449459": {"Name": "Brett S.J.", "AuthorID": "57205449459", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Perioperative Medicine and Critical Care Research, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6701752249": {"Name": "Bottle A.", "AuthorID": "6701752249", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "57202144888": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57202144888", "AffiliationID": "60007910", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Lancaster Infirmary"}, "57207537046": {"Name": "Benn J.", "AuthorID": "57207537046", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London"}}}
