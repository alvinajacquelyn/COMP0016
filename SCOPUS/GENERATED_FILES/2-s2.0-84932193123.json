The highly polymorphic nature of these enzymes has been linked to variability in antidepressant metabolism rates, leading to hope regarding the use of P450 genotyping to guide treatment. However, evidence that P450 genotypic differences underlie the variation in treatment outcomes is inconclusive. Objectives: We explored the links between both P450 genotype and serum concentrations of antidepressant with antidepressant side effects, using data from the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression Project (GENDEP), which is a large (n = 868), pharmacogenetic study of depressed individuals treated with escitalopram or nortriptyline. Methods: Patients were genotyped for the enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, and serum concentrations of both antidepressant and primary metabolite were measured after 8 weeks of treatment. Side effects were assessed weekly. We investigated associations between P450 genotypes, serum concentrations of antidepressants and side effects, as well as the relationship between P450 genotype and study discontinuation. Results: P450 genotype did not predict total side effect burden (nortriptyline: n = 251, p = 0.5638, \u03b2 = -0.133, standard error (SE) = 0.229; escitalopram: n = 340, p = 0.9627, \u03b2 = -0.004, SE = 0.085), study discontinuation (nortriptyline n = 284, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.300, p = 0.174; escitalopram n = 376, HR = 0.870, p = 0.118) or specific side effects. Serum concentrations of antidepressant were only related to a minority of the specific side effects measured: dry mouth, dizziness and diarrhoea. Conclusions: In this sample where antidepressant dosage is titrated using clinical judgement, P450 genotypes do not explain differences between patients in side effects with antidepressants. Serum drug concentrations appear to only explain variability in the occurrence of a minority of specific side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antidepressant", "Cytochrome P450 enzymes", "Drug metabolism", "Pharmacogenetics", "Side effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antidepressive Agents", "Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation", "Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic", "Citalopram", "Cohort Studies", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Depression", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Nortriptyline", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932193123", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55257500600": {"Name": "Hodgson K.", "AuthorID": "55257500600", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35171626800": {"Name": "Tansey K.E.", "AuthorID": "35171626800", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57201919550": {"Name": "Uher R.", "AuthorID": "57201919550", "AffiliationID": "60023750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie University"}, "7102548208": {"Name": "Craig I.W.", "AuthorID": "7102548208", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003415672": {"Name": "Aitchison K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003415672", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"}, "7102158824": {"Name": "Farmer A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102158824", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57203252012": {"Name": "McGuffin P.", "AuthorID": "57203252012", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "6602737481": {"Name": "Dernov\u0161ek M.Z.", "AuthorID": "6602737481", "AffiliationID": "110180855", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Clinic"}, "7004006411": {"Name": "Mors O.", "AuthorID": "7004006411", "AffiliationID": "123631074", "AffiliationName": "Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research"}, "7202945962": {"Name": "Hauser J.", "AuthorID": "7202945962", "AffiliationID": "60069010", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Psychiatric Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences"}, "7003619771": {"Name": "Souery D.", "AuthorID": "7003619771", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Psychologie M\u00e9dicale, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, PsyPluriel - Centre Europ\u00e9an de Psychologie M\u00e9dicale"}, "36046783700": {"Name": "Maier W.", "AuthorID": "36046783700", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn"}, "55933046400": {"Name": "Henigsberg N.", "AuthorID": "55933046400", "AffiliationID": "60006461, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Croatian Institute for Brain Research, Medical School, University of Zagreb"}, "16741658400": {"Name": "Rietschel M.", "AuthorID": "16741658400", "AffiliationID": "60005285", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetic Epidemiology in Psychiatry, Central Institute of Mental Health"}, "7801331319": {"Name": "Placentino A.", "AuthorID": "7801331319", "AffiliationID": "60011918", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric Unit (UOP 23), Department of Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry Unit Spedali Civili Hospital of Brescia"}}}
