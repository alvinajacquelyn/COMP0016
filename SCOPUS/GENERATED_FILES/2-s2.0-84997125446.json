Following on the work of Charles Tilly and others, it prioritizes relations and interactions in the dynamics of ethnic boundary preservation, rather than individual entities. The author first outlines the role of boundary activation mechanisms in ethnic conflict. The author then presents the interactions between elites and masses of ethnic groups in mixed settings that preserve coexistence, noting how a rupture of these interactions can lead to conflict. The aim of this orientation is to identify causal mechanisms and sequences in political processes. These mechanisms and sequences then serve as general statements that can be examined across a variety of settings. The author concludes with a sketch of how progress in the field will involve a stronger focus on local research. In particular, the revered ethnic and political demographics of ethnic enclaves are a fruitful area for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997125446", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"6602744400": {"Name": "Stroschein S.", "AuthorID": "6602744400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
