Design Retrospective case series. Methods A retrospective chart review of 4 patients diagnosed with late subconjunctival relapse of previously resected iris melanoma. Results Three female patients and 1 male patient underwent iris tumor resection and presented to our service with suspicious conjunctival lesions at a median of 22 years later (mean: 21 years). None showed intraocular relapse. Treatment of the conjunctival tumors included excisional biopsy (n = 4), followed by cryotherapy (n = 3) and/or brachytherapy (n = 3). In all cases, histopathology confirmed malignant melanoma, with no intraepithelial component or associated melanosis. Genetic sequencing (n = 3) showed wild-type BRAF and NRAS in all. GNA11 mutation was found in 1 case. On array-based comparative genomic hybridization (n = 3), gain of 6p was found in 2 cases and gain of 8 in 2. Overall, findings were strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of late extraocular relapse from previously resected iris melanoma. In a median of 2.5 years (mean: 7.7 years) from the subconjunctival relapse, no further episodes of intraocular/extraocular recurrence were recorded, and all patients were free from distant metastasis. Conclusions Patients undergoing iris melanoma resection are at risk of developing late solitary extraocular relapse even more than 30 years after surgery. In the absence of an intraocular component, diagnosis may be challenging, as tumors mimic a primary conjunctival lesion. Management by excisional biopsy followed by adjuvant therapy was successful, and histopathology and genetic analysis supported a diagnosis of extraocular uveal tumor spread rather than a primary conjunctival tumor.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brachytherapy", "Comparative Genomic Hybridization", "Conjunctival Neoplasms", "Cryotherapy", "Female", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits", "Humans", "Iris Neoplasms", "Male", "Melanoma", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026358234", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"35310047800": {"Name": "Fabian I.D.", "AuthorID": "35310047800", "AffiliationID": "60005681, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University"}, "6602525615": {"Name": "Thaung C.", "AuthorID": "6602525615", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56898992700": {"Name": "AlHarby L.", "AuthorID": "56898992700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "51864897600": {"Name": "Stacey A.W.", "AuthorID": "51864897600", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "56926100600": {"Name": "Arora A.K.", "AuthorID": "56926100600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "54790539900": {"Name": "Cohen V.M.L.", "AuthorID": "54790539900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6603976159": {"Name": "Sisley K.", "AuthorID": "6603976159", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology & Orthoptics, Department of Oncology & Metabolism, The Medical School, The University of Sheffield"}, "56346677200": {"Name": "Doherty R.E.", "AuthorID": "56346677200", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology & Orthoptics, Department of Oncology & Metabolism, The Medical School, The University of Sheffield"}, "6603505647": {"Name": "Mudhar H.S.", "AuthorID": "6603505647", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "National Specialist Ophthalmic Pathology Service, Department of Histopathology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}}}
