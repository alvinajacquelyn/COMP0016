However whilst a number of studies have investigated perception of relatively simple experimental stimuli in these individuals, little is known about multiple object and complex scene perception and the role of eye movements in posterior cortical atrophy. We embrace the distinction between high-level (top-down) and low-level (bottom-up) influences upon scanning eye movements when looking at scenes. This distinction was inspired by Yarbus (1967), who demonstrated how the location of our fixations is affected by task instructions and not only the stimulus' low level properties. We therefore examined how scanning patterns are influenced by task instructions and low-level visual properties in 7 patients with posterior cortical atrophy, 8 patients with typical Alzheimer's disease, and 19 healthy age-matched controls.Each participant viewed 10 scenes under four task conditions (encoding, recognition, search and description) whilst eye movements were recorded. The results reveal significant differences between groups in the impact of test instructions upon scanpaths. Across tasks without a search component, posterior cortical atrophy patients were significantly less consistent than typical Alzheimer's disease patients and controls in where they were looking. By contrast, when comparing search and non-search tasks, it was controls who exhibited lowest between-task similarity ratings, suggesting they were better able than posterior cortical atrophy or typical Alzheimer's disease patients to respond appropriately to high-level needs by looking at task-relevant regions of a scene. Posterior cortical atrophy patients had a significant tendency to fixate upon more low-level salient parts of the scenes than controls irrespective of the viewing task. The study provides a detailed characterisation of scene perception abilities in posterior cortical atrophy and offers insights into the mechanisms by which high-level cognitive schemes interact with low-level perception.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Eye tracking", "Neurodegenerative disorders", "Visual agnosia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Dementia", "Eye Movement Measurements", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occipital Lobe", "Parietal Lobe", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Space Perception", "Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921475744", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55036185800": {"Name": "Shakespeare T.", "AuthorID": "55036185800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55650633000": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "55650633000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26659237900": {"Name": "Pertzov Y.", "AuthorID": "26659237900", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "25630004900": {"Name": "Nicholas J.", "AuthorID": "25630004900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
