Using sub-grid physics recipes to post-process the outputs of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, a molecular gas phase is condensed out of the hot and partly ionized SPH gas. The gas is subjected to far-UV radiation fields and cosmic ray ionization rates which are set to scale with the local star formation rate volume density. Level populations and radiative transport of the CO lines are solved with the 3D radiative transfer code LIME. We have applied S\u00cdGAME to cosmological SPH simulations of three disc galaxies at z = 2 with stellar masses in the range ~0.5-2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and star formation rates ~40-140 M\u2299 yr-1. Global CO luminosities and line ratios are in agreement with observations of disc galaxies at z ~ 2 up to and including J = 3-2 but falling short of the few existing J=5-4 observations. The central 5 kpc regions of our galaxies have CO 3 - 2/1 - 0 and 7 - 6/1 - 0 brightness temperature ratios of ~0.55-0.65 and ~0.02-0.08, respectively, while further out in the disc the ratios drop to more quiescent values of ~0.5 and <0.01. Global CO-to-H2 conversion (\u03b1CO) factors are \u22431.5M\u2299 pc-2 (K km s-1)-1, i.e. ~2-3 times below the typically adopted values for disc galaxies, and aCO increases with radius, in agreement with observations of nearby galaxies. Adopting a top-heavy Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) mass spectrum does not significantly change the results. Steepening the GMC density profiles leads to higher global line ratios for Jup = 3 and CO-to-H2 conversion factors [\u22433.6M\u2299 pc-2 (K km s-1)-1].", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: high-redshift", "Galaxies: ISM", "ISM: clouds", "ISM: lines and bands", "Methods: numerical", "Radiative transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976870653", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55598525200": {"Name": "Olsen K.P.", "AuthorID": "55598525200", "AffiliationID": "60017041, 60095454, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004057375": {"Name": "Sommer-Larsen J.", "AuthorID": "7004057375", "AffiliationID": "109641717", "AffiliationName": "Marie Kruses Skole"}, "13005983900": {"Name": "Rasmussen J.", "AuthorID": "13005983900", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Technical University of Denmark"}, "7004109829": {"Name": "Toft S.", "AuthorID": "7004109829", "AffiliationID": "60017041, 60095454, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"}, "6602955688": {"Name": "Zirm A.", "AuthorID": "6602955688", "AffiliationID": "60017041, 60095454, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"}, "10339159000": {"Name": "Greve T.R.", "AuthorID": "10339159000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15822001000": {"Name": "Brinch C.", "AuthorID": "15822001000", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "DeIC, Technical University of Denmark"}}}
