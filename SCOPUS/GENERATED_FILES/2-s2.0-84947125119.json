We focus on the role of geography on university entry and aspirations due to the increasing requirement in society for a higher education qualification for access to prestigious positions in society. Using a large representative longitudinal database (N = 11,999; 50 % male; 27 % provincial or rural; 2 % Indigenous) of Australia youth we explore the association between distance to a university campus and the critical attainment outcomes of university entry and enrolment in an elite university as well as critical predictors of these outcomes in access to information resources (i.e., university outreach programs) and university aspirations. In doing so, we provide new insight into distance effects, and the extent that these are due to selection, cost, and community influence. Our findings suggest that distance is significantly associated with both university expectations and entrance, with an especially large impact upon young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds. However, we also find little evidence that distance is related to attending a university led information session. Our conclusion is that distance effects cannot be fully explained by selection in terms of academic achievement and socioeconomic status, and that anticipatory decisions and costs are the most likely drivers of the distance effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distance effects", "Institution choice", "University aspirations", "University entry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Academic Success", "Adolescent", "Aspirations (Psychology)", "Australia", "Educational Status", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Residence Characteristics", "Universities", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947125119", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"23470098500": {"Name": "Parker P.D.", "AuthorID": "23470098500", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Positive Psychology and Education, Faculty of Health Sciences, Australian Catholic University"}, "54418736800": {"Name": "Jerrim J.", "AuthorID": "54418736800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56960008800": {"Name": "Anders J.", "AuthorID": "56960008800", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "36924540400": {"Name": "Astell-Burt T.", "AuthorID": "36924540400", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and Geosciences, University of St Andrews"}}}
