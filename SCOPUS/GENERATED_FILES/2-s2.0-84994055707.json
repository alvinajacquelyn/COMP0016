Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is an important innate immune molecule, localized in pulmonary surfactant. SP-A binds to carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens in a calcium-dependent manner to enable neutralisation, agglutination and clearance of pathogens including RSV. SP-A forms trimeric units and further oligomerises through interactions between its N-terminal domains. Whilst a recombinant trimeric fragment of the closely related molecule (surfactant protein D) has been shown to retain many of the native protein's functions, the importance of the SP-A oligomeric structure in its interaction with RSV has not been determined. The aim of this study was to produce a functional trimeric recombinant fragment of human (rfh)SP-A, which lacks the N-terminal domain (and the capacity to oligomerise) and test its ability to neutralise RSV in an in vitro model of human bronchial epithelial infection. We used a novel expression tag derived from spider silk proteins (\u2018NT\u2019) to produce rfhSP-A in Escherichia coli, which we found to be trimeric and to bind to mannan in a calcium-dependent manner. Trimeric rfhSP-A reduced infection levels of human bronchial epithelial (AALEB) cells by RSV by up to a mean (\u00b1SD) of 96.4 (\u00b11.9) % at 5 \u03bcg/ml, which was significantly more effective than dimeric rfhSP-A (34.3 (\u00b120.5) %) (p < 0.0001). Comparatively, native human SP-A reduced RSV infection by up to 38.5 (\u00b128.4) %. For the first time we report the development of a functional trimeric rfhSP-A molecule which is highly efficacious in neutralising RSV, despite lacking the N-terminal domain and capacity to oligomerise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collectin", "Innate immunity", "Neutralisation", "NT domain", "Recombinant trimeric fragment", "Respiratory syncytial virus", "Surfactant protein A"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbohydrate Metabolism", "Carbohydrates", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Expression", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994055707", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"56996651600": {"Name": "Watson A.", "AuthorID": "56996651600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Clinical & Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "6603136795": {"Name": "Spalluto C.M.", "AuthorID": "6603136795", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Clinical & Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "6701613987": {"Name": "Staples K.J.", "AuthorID": "6701613987", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Clinical & Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "7202351234": {"Name": "Wilkinson T.", "AuthorID": "7202351234", "AffiliationID": "60021722, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "Southampton NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Southampton General Hospital"}, "35449178600": {"Name": "Madsen J.", "AuthorID": "35449178600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7202405777": {"Name": "Clark H.", "AuthorID": "7202405777", "AffiliationID": "60021722, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "Southampton NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Southampton General Hospital"}, "23027925900": {"Name": "Kronqvist N.", "AuthorID": "23027925900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division for Neurogeriatrics, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of NVS, Karolinska Institutet"}, "8394788600": {"Name": "Rising A.", "AuthorID": "8394788600", "AffiliationID": "60027152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences"}, "56519169400": {"Name": "Johansson J.", "AuthorID": "56519169400", "AffiliationID": "60027152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences"}, "57203087605": {"Name": "Griffiths M.", "AuthorID": "57203087605", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Leukocyte Biology, Imperial College London, Royal Brompton Campus"}, "57202565360": {"Name": "Holmskov U.", "AuthorID": "57202565360", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "7102982904": {"Name": "Sorensen G.L.", "AuthorID": "7102982904", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}}}
