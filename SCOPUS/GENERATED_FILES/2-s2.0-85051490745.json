In this paper, we report on-going work investigating a game prototype with haptic feedback for seven year old children's engagement with geometrical concepts as part of an iterative design study. Our findings include a new game play mode adopted by the children, that empowers the use of haptic feedback in game play and has the potential to enable the enactment of shape properties in the game play process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children's interaction", "Embodied cognition", "Haptic devices", "Learning", "Multisensory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Children's interaction", "Embodied cognition", "Haptic devices", "Learning", "Multisensory"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051490745", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"43461953000": {"Name": "Yiannoutsou N.", "AuthorID": "43461953000", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "36703985700": {"Name": "Johnson R.", "AuthorID": "36703985700", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "16234800800": {"Name": "Price S.", "AuthorID": "16234800800", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
