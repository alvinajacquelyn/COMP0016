Methods: A prospectively maintained database identified 174 patients who underwent Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy for cancer. Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were collected. X-tile software was used to identify the optimal resection point. Two models were analysed: single point resection with comparison of two groups (short and long), and two resection points with three groups (short, medium, and long) to provide a range. Results: The median PRM was 4.0 cm (interquartile range: 2.5\u20136.0 cm). After adjustment for significant confounders, multivariable Cox PH analysis demonstrated that the optimal resection margin was 1.7 cm, and in the three-group analysis the optimum PRM was between 1.7 and 3 cm. In the two-group analysis, the long margin had no effect on DFS (p = 0.37), but carried a significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.46, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.25\u20130.87, p = 0.02). In the three-group analysis, the medium and long groups had improved OS compared with the short group (on average 54 %, HR \u2265 0.45, p \u2264 0.04). The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were highest in the medium PRM group (48 and 57 % respectively). Conclusions: Optimal survival following oesophagectomy for cancer is achieved with a PRM > 1.7 cm, but a PRM > 3 cm does not yield a further survival advantage. Thus, the optimal PRM is likely to be between 1.7 and 3 cm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Aged", "Carcinoma, Small Cell", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophagectomy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Margins of Excision", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984630320", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"24460308700": {"Name": "Qureshi Y.", "AuthorID": "24460308700", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Royal London Hospital"}, "57201044059": {"Name": "Walker R.", "AuthorID": "57201044059", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Royal London Hospital"}, "57214157404": {"Name": "Hughes S.", "AuthorID": "57214157404", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Royal London Hospital"}, "23012898100": {"Name": "Sarker S.", "AuthorID": "23012898100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
