New York.It is not highly sophisticated, yet the N\u2192S acyl transfer reaction of a native peptide sequence potentially fills an important technology gap. While several routes to synthetic peptide thioesters exist, only one is routinely applicable for biologically derived samples. Using the naturally occurring amino acid cysteine as the sole activator for N\u2192S acyl transfer we have demonstrated transformation of synthetic and biologically derived precursors into thioesters for use in Native Chemical Ligation, providing a viable alternative for biological samples. Further refinement will be key to realising the full potential of this intriguing process, and increase the number of applications in peptide engineering and therapeutics. 1 Introduction 2 N\u2192S acyl transfer in 'normal' peptide sequences 3 Reduced reactivity of internal Xaa-Cys motifs as an advantage in head-to-tail peptide cyclisation 4 Reduced reactivity of internal Xaa-Cys motifs as an advantage in modification and cyclisation of biologically produced precursors 5 Hydrazinolysis of Xaa-Cys motifs and the acyl hydrazide as a stable thioester equivalent 6 Rapid thioester formation via an N\u2192Se acyl shift 7 Outlook and conclusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acyl transfer", "cyclic peptides", "native chemical ligation", "thioester"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018371370", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"15127363300": {"Name": "Macmillan D.", "AuthorID": "15127363300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
