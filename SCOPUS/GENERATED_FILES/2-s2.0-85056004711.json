Adaptive training based on working memory (WM) has been shown to ameliorate cognitive symptoms, although the effects at a neural level are unclear. The aim of this study was to expand the existing research on the effects of an adaptive WM rehabilitative intervention on brain functional activity in PwMS. A sample of eighteen PwMS performed an 8-week home-based cognitive rehabilitation treatment based on adaptive WM training. PwMS were assessed before and after treatment using a validated neuropsychological battery and undergoing an fMRI session while carrying out a cognitive task (i.e., Paced Visual Serial Addition Test - PVSAT). fMRI activations were compared to the activation pattern elicited by eighteen matched healthy subjects performing the same task. At baseline, we found abnormal brain activity during PVSAT in PwMS when compared to healthy subjects, with a pattern including several bilateral activation clusters. Following rehabilitation, PwMS improved cognitive performance, as evaluated by the neuropsychological battery, and showed a different activation map with clusters mainly located in the right cerebellum and in the left hemisphere. The only significant cluster in the right hemisphere was located in the inferior parietal lobule, and the BOLD signal extracted in this area significantly correlated with cognitive performance both before and after the treatment. We suggest that WM training can improve the cognitive performance and reduce the abnormal activation of PwMS by partially maintaining or even restoring brain cognitive function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive training", "Cognitive rehabilitation", "Cognitive reserve", "fMRI", "Multiple sclerosis", "Working memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebellum", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parietal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056004711", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"6602628313": {"Name": "Bonzano L.", "AuthorID": "6602628313", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Research Centre on Nervous System Diseases, University of Genoa"}, "23493507300": {"Name": "Pardini M.", "AuthorID": "23493507300", "AffiliationID": "60107402, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"}, "55774130800": {"Name": "Pedull\u00e0 L.", "AuthorID": "55774130800", "AffiliationID": "112645675", "AffiliationName": "Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Scientific Research Area"}, "7003456756": {"Name": "Bove M.", "AuthorID": "7003456756", "AffiliationID": "60107402, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"}, "16246150800": {"Name": "Tacchino A.", "AuthorID": "16246150800", "AffiliationID": "112645675", "AffiliationName": "Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Scientific Research Area"}, "6603621848": {"Name": "Zaratin P.", "AuthorID": "6603621848", "AffiliationID": "112645675", "AffiliationName": "Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Scientific Research Area"}, "6506371342": {"Name": "Brichetto G.", "AuthorID": "6506371342", "AffiliationID": "112645675", "AffiliationName": "Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Scientific Research Area"}, "55335518600": {"Name": "Battaglia M.A.", "AuthorID": "55335518600", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science, University of Siena"}}}
