Using LD score regression analysis, we show significant enrichment in PD heritability within regulatory sites for LPS-activated monocytes and that TLR4 expression is highest within human substantia nigra, the most affected brain region, suggesting a role for TLR4 inflammatory responses. We then performed extended incubation of cells with physiological concentrations of small alpha-synuclein oligomers observing the development of a TLR4-dependent sensitized inflammatory response with time, including TNF-\u03b1 production. ROS and cell death in primary neuronal cultures were significantly reduced by TLR4 antagonists revealing that an indirect inflammatory mechanism involving cytokines produced by glial cells makes a major contribution to neuronal death. Prolonged exposure to low levels of alpha-synuclein oligomers sensitizes TLR4 responsiveness in astrocytes and microglial, explaining how they become pro-inflammatory, and may be an early causative event in PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation", "Alpha-synuclein", "Innate immunity", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "TLR4"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Cell Death", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Microglia", "Neurons", "Parkinson Disease", "Substantia Nigra", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053549320", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55680859000": {"Name": "Hughes C.D.", "AuthorID": "55680859000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "22979848600": {"Name": "Hopkins L.", "AuthorID": "22979848600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7103310191": {"Name": "Bryant C.", "AuthorID": "7103310191", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "36542475200": {"Name": "Drews A.", "AuthorID": "36542475200", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "55657540300": {"Name": "Iljina M.", "AuthorID": "55657540300", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57199328063": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "57199328063", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "57149476800": {"Name": "Choi M.L.", "AuthorID": "57149476800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "9739583500": {"Name": "Gandhi S.", "AuthorID": "9739583500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57217124361": {"Name": "Ryten M.", "AuthorID": "57217124361", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "6603778116": {"Name": "Bot\u00eda J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603778116", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de la Informaci\u00f3n y las Comunicaciones, Universidad de Murcia"}, "56125286000": {"Name": "Gagliano S.A.", "AuthorID": "56125286000", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan"}}}
