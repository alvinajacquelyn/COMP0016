Methods and materials: All patients with intermediate-risk, stage III (LN positive) WT consecutively registered in the SIOP-WT-2001 study were included in this analysis. Endpoints were 5-year event-free survival (EFS), loco-regional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS). Results: Between June 2001 and May 2015, 2,569 patients with stage I to III WT after preoperative chemotherapy were registered in the SIOP-WT-2001 study. Five hundred and twenty-three (20%) had stage III disease, of which 113 patients had stage III due to positive LN only. Of those, 101 (89%) received radiotherapy, 36 of which (36%) received, apart from flank irradiation, a boost dose to the LN positive area. Four patients (4%) did not receive any adjuvant radiotherapy. In eight patients information on radiotherapy was not available. With a median follow-up of 71 months, no difference in 5-year EFS (84% vs. 83%, P = 0.77) and LRC (96% vs. 97%, P = 0.91) was observed between patients receiving a radiotherapy boost and those without boost, respectively. Five-year OS, including salvage therapy, was excellent (boost vs. no boost: 97% vs. 95%, P = 0.58). Conclusions: Outcome data demonstrate that omission of the radiotherapy boost to the loco-regional positive lymph nodes in patients with intermediate-risk, stage III WT who receive preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative flank irradiation (14.4 Gy) can be considered a safe approach for future SIOP protocols.", "AuthorKeywords": ["boost", "intermediate risk", "lymph node", "radiotherapy", "Wilms tumour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Dactinomycin", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Radiotherapy, Adjuvant", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Vincristine", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046076015", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"55918113700": {"Name": "D\u00e1vila Fajardo R.", "AuthorID": "55918113700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "16480496300": {"Name": "Janssens G.O.", "AuthorID": "16480496300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "57201778466": {"Name": "Oldenburger E.", "AuthorID": "57201778466", "AffiliationID": "100645993", "AffiliationName": "Radiation Oncology Department, Leuven Cancer Center"}, "35468349200": {"Name": "R\u00fcbe C.", "AuthorID": "35468349200", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radio-Oncology, University Hospital of Saarland"}, "36683049200": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Yurda M.", "AuthorID": "36683049200", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "56266131400": {"Name": "van Tinteren H.", "AuthorID": "56266131400", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7102206707": {"Name": "Bergeron C.", "AuthorID": "7102206707", "AffiliationID": "60018084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Centre Leon Berard"}, "34975072100": {"Name": "Graf N.", "AuthorID": "34975072100", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, University Hospital of Saarland"}, "7801560923": {"Name": "van Grotel M.", "AuthorID": "7801560923", "AffiliationID": "117390213", "AffiliationName": "Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Paediatric Oncology"}, "6602159710": {"Name": "van den Heuvel-Eibrink M.M.", "AuthorID": "6602159710", "AffiliationID": "117390213", "AffiliationName": "Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Paediatric Oncology"}, "56785190000": {"Name": "Saunders D.", "AuthorID": "56785190000", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology.
