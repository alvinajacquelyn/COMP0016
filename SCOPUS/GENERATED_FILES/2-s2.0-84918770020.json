Balanced activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the direct and the indirect pathways is essential for normal striatal function. This balance is disrupted in Parkinson's disease and in l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID), a common motor complication of current pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease.Methods Electrophysiological recordings were performed in mouse cortico-striatal slice preparation. Synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation, was investigated. Specific pharmacological inhibitors or genetic manipulations were used to modulate the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras-ERK) pathway, a signal transduction cascade implicated in behavioral plasticity, and synaptic activity in different subpopulations of striatal neurons was measured.Results We found that the Ras-ERK pathway, is not only essential for long-term potentiation induced with a high frequency stimulation protocol (HFS-LTP) in the dorsal striatum, but also for its reversal, synaptic depotentiation. Ablation of Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (Ras-GRF1), a neuronal activator of Ras proteins, causes a specific loss of HFS-LTP in the medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway without affecting LTP in the indirect pathway. Analysis of LTP in animals with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions (6-OHDA) rendered dyskinetic with chronic L-DOPA treatment reveals a complex, Ras-GRF1 and pathway-independent, apparently stochastic involvement of ERK.Conclusions These data not only demonstrate a central role for Ras-ERK signaling in striatal LTP, depotentiation, and LTP restored after L-DOPA treatment but also disclose multifaceted synaptic adaptations occurring in response to dopaminergic denervation and pulsatile administration of L-DOPA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depotentiation", "L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia", "Long-term depression (LTD)", "Long-term potentiation (LTP)", "Ras-ERK signaling", "Ras-GRF1", "Striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antiparkinson Agents", "Butadienes", "Cerebral Cortex", "Corpus Striatum", "Dopamine", "Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Levodopa", "Mice, Knockout", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Nitriles", "Oxidopamine", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "ras-GRF1", "Tissue Culture Techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918770020", "SubjectAreas": [["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"14010573000": {"Name": "Cerovic M.", "AuthorID": "14010573000", "AffiliationID": "60103762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Neurology (INSPE), Division of Neuroscience, IRCCS"}, "8368293600": {"Name": "Hardingham N.", "AuthorID": "8368293600", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom"}, "37121979900": {"Name": "Heuer A.", "AuthorID": "37121979900", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom"}, "12784889500": {"Name": "Bagetta V.", "AuthorID": "12784889500", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Santa Lucia, IRCCS"}, "55335727500": {"Name": "Pendolino V.", "AuthorID": "55335727500", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Santa Lucia, IRCCS"}, "12784449700": {"Name": "Ghiglieri V.", "AuthorID": "12784449700", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Santa Lucia, IRCCS"}, "6506477346": {"Name": "Giamp\u00e0 C.", "AuthorID": "6506477346", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Santa Lucia, IRCCS"}, "7102418853": {"Name": "Calabresi P.", "AuthorID": "7102418853", "AffiliationID": "60003003, 60001261", "AffiliationName": "Clinica Neurologica, University of Perugia, Ospedale S.
