One of two studies involving offline digital interventions (Klein and Card, 2011), two of three online web-based interventions (Bull et al., 2012; Mevissen et al., 2011) and one of two interventions involving printed materials (Scholes et al., 2003) were found to be effective for reducing self-reported sexual risk behavior patterns in young people.\u201d Updated references are given below: \u201cDermen, K.H., Thomas, S.N., 2011.
