Issues around the development of foetal personhood, the medical management of the pregnant body and the social role of the pregnant woman are explored. Findings suggest that Qatari women are expected to be calm vessels for their growing baby and should avoid certain foods and behaviours. These ideas of risk avoidance are linked to indigenous knowledge around a mother's influence on a child's health and traits. Motherhood holds a particularly important place in Qatari culture and in Islam, and women are ultimately responsible for protecting and promoting fertility and for producing healthy children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Miscarriage", "Pregnancy", "Qatar", "Risk", "Women's health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015253313", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"23028373000": {"Name": "Kilshaw S.", "AuthorID": "23028373000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "55494852500": {"Name": "Miller D.", "AuthorID": "55494852500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "57193612607": {"Name": "Omar N.", "AuthorID": "57193612607", "AffiliationID": "60072750", "AffiliationName": "Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "24484724200": {"Name": "Major S.", "AuthorID": "24484724200", "AffiliationID": "60072750", "AffiliationName": "Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57193510080": {"Name": "Mohsen M.", "AuthorID": "57193510080", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford University"}, "6507864087": {"Name": "Al Tamimi H.", "AuthorID": "6507864087", "AffiliationID": "60072743", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation"}, "8842160400": {"Name": "El-Taher F.", "AuthorID": "8842160400", "AffiliationID": "60072743", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation"}, "57193607698": {"Name": "Sole K.", "AuthorID": "57193607698", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "University of Oslo"}}}
