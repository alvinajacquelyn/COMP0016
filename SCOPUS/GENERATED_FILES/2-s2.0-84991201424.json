Diagnosis has often been a difficult task, due to the wide range in age of onset of NP-C and clinical presentation of the disease, combined with the complexity of the cell biology (filipin) laboratory testing, even in combination with genetic testing. This has led to substantial delays in diagnosis, largely depending on the access to specialist centres and the level of knowledge about NP-C of the physician in the area. In recent years, advances in mass spectrometry has allowed identification of several sensitive plasma biomarkers elevated in NP-C (e.g. cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol, lysosphingomyelin isoforms and bile acid metabolites), which, together with the concomitant progress in molecular genetic technology, have greatly impacted the strategy of laboratory testing. Specificity of the biomarkers is currently under investigation and other pathologies are being found to also result in elevations. Molecular genetic testing also has its limitations, notably with unidentified mutations and the classification of new variants. This review is intended to increase awareness on the currently available approaches to laboratory diagnosis of NP-C, to provide an up to date, comprehensive and critical evaluation of the various techniques (cell biology, biochemical biomarkers and molecular genetics), and to briefly discuss ongoing/future developments. The use of current tests in proper combination enables a rapid and correct diagnosis in a large majority of cases. However, even with recent progress, definitive diagnosis remains challenging in some patients, for whom combined genetic/biochemical/cytochemical markers do not provide a clear answer. Expertise and reference laboratories thus remain essential, and further work is still required to fulfill unmet needs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Filipin", "Lysosphingomyelin", "Niemann-Pick disease type C", "NPC1 gene", "NPC2 gene", "Oxysterol"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Bile Acids and Salts", "Biomarkers", "Carrier Proteins", "Cholestanes", "Genetic Testing", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C", "Phosphorylcholine", "Sphingosine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991201424", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"7005465373": {"Name": "Vanier M.T.", "AuthorID": "7005465373", "AffiliationID": "60012357", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Gillet-M\u00e9rieux, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie Est, Hospices Civils de Lyon"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57197281204": {"Name": "Bauer P.", "AuthorID": "57197281204", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7102780743": {"Name": "Coll M.J.", "AuthorID": "7102780743", "AffiliationID": "105998865", "AffiliationName": "CIBERER"}, "35894644700": {"Name": "Burlina A.", "AuthorID": "35894644700", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Division of Inherited Metabolic Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital"}, "55907064300": {"Name": "Hendriksz C.J.", "AuthorID": "55907064300", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "University of Pretoria, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health"}, "7006527032": {"Name": "Latour P.", "AuthorID": "7006527032", "AffiliationID": "60012357", "AffiliationName": "UF de Neurog\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie Est, Hospices Civils de Lyon"}, "26642869000": {"Name": "Goizet C.", "AuthorID": "26642869000", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM Unit 1211, University of Bordeaux"}, "55429588700": {"Name": "Welford R.W.D.", "AuthorID": "55429588700", "AffiliationID": "60002683", "AffiliationName": "Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd."}, "55303140900": {"Name": "Kolb S.A.", "AuthorID": "55303140900", "AffiliationID": "60002683", "AffiliationName": "Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd."}, "55196533700": {"Name": "Marquardt T.", "AuthorID": "55196533700", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Inborn Errors of Metabolism, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}}}
