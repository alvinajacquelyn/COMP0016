Service provision increased literacy by 62%, enhanced income by 36%, and reduced health costs by 26%. Evidence suggests that a gender-sensitive consideration of infrastructure is necessary and that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach will not suffice. We provide evidence that infrastructure investment is critical for well-being of slum dwellers and women in particular.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gender", "Health", "India", "Infrastructure", "Poverty", "Slums"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908374920", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"26031677400": {"Name": "Parikh P.", "AuthorID": "26031677400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190371154": {"Name": "Fu K.", "AuthorID": "57190371154", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57201570526": {"Name": "George G.", "AuthorID": "57201570526", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "37047555100": {"Name": "Parikh H.", "AuthorID": "37047555100", "AffiliationID": "110069586", "AffiliationName": "Himanshu Parikh Consulting Engineers"}, "6505820815": {"Name": "McRobie A.", "AuthorID": "6505820815", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University"}}}
