Around 40% of the GNPs survived the high spraying temperatures and were distributed along the splat-interfaces, forming a percolated network. These YAS-GNP coatings are potentially interesting in thermal protection systems and electromagnetic interference shields for aerospace applications; therefore silicon carbide (SiC) materials at the forefront of those applications were employed as substrates. Whereas the YAS coatings are nonconductive, the YAS-GNP coatings showed in-plane electrical conductivity (\u223c10<sup>2</sup> S\u00b7m<sup>-1</sup>) for which a low percolation limit (below 3.6 vol %) is inferred. Indentation tests revealed the formation of a highly damaged indentation zone showing multiple shear displacements between adjacent splats probably favored by the graphene sheets location. The indentation radial cracks typically found in brittle glass coatings are not detected in the hybrid coatings that are also more compliant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electrical conductivity", "electromagnetic interference shielding", "graphene nanoplatelets", "heat resistant glass", "hybrid coatings", "strain tolerance", "thermal protection", "thermal spraying"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical conductivity", "Electromagnetic interference shielding", "Graphene nanoplatelets", "Heat resistant", "Hybrid coating", "Strain tolerance", "Thermal protection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939857447", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7402249990": {"Name": "Garcia E.", "AuthorID": "7402249990", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV-CSIC)"}, "36721979400": {"Name": "Nistal A.", "AuthorID": "36721979400", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV-CSIC)"}, "7003462423": {"Name": "Osendi M.", "AuthorID": "7003462423", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV-CSIC)"}, "7003944724": {"Name": "Miranzo P.", "AuthorID": "7003944724", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV-CSIC)"}, "56414346800": {"Name": "Khalifa A.", "AuthorID": "56414346800", "AffiliationID": "60113387", "AffiliationName": "Aernnova Engineering Solutions Ib\u00e9rica"}, "6507198163": {"Name": "Essa Y.", "AuthorID": "6507198163", "AffiliationID": "60113387", "AffiliationName": "Aernnova Engineering Solutions Ib\u00e9rica"}, "56414870300": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn De La Escalera F.", "AuthorID": "56414870300", "AffiliationID": "60113387", "AffiliationName": "Aernnova Engineering Solutions Ib\u00e9rica"}}}
