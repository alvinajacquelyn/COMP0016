Ch\u00e1vez as a martyr, as the second Bol\u00edvar, as a saint, as a spirit, is becoming part of the religious and social life of a great number of people. Despite being dead, he continues to shape Venezuelan revolutionary selves. An examination of Ch\u00e1vez's legacy through the lens of divine kinship provides important clues to understanding how charisma is embodied in people and things and circulates through networks of kinship (and fictive kinship) from gods, spirits, and ancestors to democratically appointed leaders and their ordinary followers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charisma", "Electoral representation", "Kinship", "Popular religion", "The New Man"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007047587", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"23980713800": {"Name": "Michelutti L.", "AuthorID": "23980713800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
