In our conditions, the molten salt acted as solvent and reducing agent for the precipitation and formation of Co-based nano-structures. It was observed that in the Co@Co(OH)2 core-shell nanostructure, Co cores can act as a conductive medium to improve the utilization of Co(OH)2 due to the superior electrical conductivity of Co metal and its high surface area. It was also found that the as-prepared Co@Co(OH)2 exhibited high electrochemical performance as a cathode material in asymmetric supercapacitors, yielding specific capacitance values of up to ~410 F g\u22121 at 2 A g\u22121 with a retention rate of 90 % after 2500 cycles. The achievement of high capacitance coupled to a low cost method represents an important step forward in the development of promising electrode materials for alkaline supercapacitor cathodes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cobalt hydroxide", "Core-shell", "Molten salt", "Supercapacitor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetric supercapacitor", "Cobalt hydroxides", "Core shell", "Core shell nano structures", "Electrochemical performance", "High specific capacitances", "Molten salt", "Super capacitor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988360746", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57189061214": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57189061214", "AffiliationID": "60003640", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Northwest Normal University"}, "26436412000": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "26436412000", "AffiliationID": "60003640", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Northwest Normal University"}, "54415016600": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "54415016600", "AffiliationID": "60003640", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Northwest Normal University"}, "12802385800": {"Name": "Ji S.", "AuthorID": "12802385800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191248248": {"Name": "Xu R.", "AuthorID": "57191248248", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003706028": {"Name": "Pollet B.", "AuthorID": "7003706028", "AffiliationID": "117389613", "AffiliationName": "Power and Water t/a KP2M Ltd"}}}
