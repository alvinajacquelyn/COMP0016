In this context, this paper mobilizes the potential of urban climate modelling and remote sensing to improve the understanding of urban health risk variations in Sub-Saharan Africa. The combination of Stewart and Oke's (2012) universal classification of Local Climate Zones with very high resolution satellite imagery is explored for the parameterization of a simple urban canopy model (TERRA_URB) over two cities: Kampala (Uganda) and Dakar (Senegal). Key challenges, such as data scarcity and performing analyses on multi spatio-temporal scales are emphasized. Applications for a better understanding of links between urban climates and intra-urban health issues in highly dynamic urban environments are illustrated and discussed taking intra-urban malaria risk as an example.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058947176", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"57190129457": {"Name": "Brousse O.", "AuthorID": "57190129457", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "55257694800": {"Name": "Wouters H.", "AuthorID": "55257694800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Hydrology and Water Management, Ghent University"}, "6701895637": {"Name": "van Lipzig N.P.M.", "AuthorID": "6701895637", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "57194724716": {"Name": "Georganos S.", "AuthorID": "57194724716", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Environment and Society (DGES), Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "15058526100": {"Name": "Vanhuysse S.", "AuthorID": "15058526100", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Environment and Society (DGES), Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "7202905674": {"Name": "Wolff E.", "AuthorID": "7202905674", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Environment and Society (DGES), Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "25647575500": {"Name": "Demuzere M.", "AuthorID": "25647575500", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Hydrology and Water Management, Ghent University"}, "16307405100": {"Name": "Linard C.", "AuthorID": "16307405100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, UNamur"}, "50461289000": {"Name": "Dujardin S.", "AuthorID": "50461289000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, UNamur"}}}
