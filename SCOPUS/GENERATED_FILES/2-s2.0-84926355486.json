A microprinting technique using a computer-driven micropipette has been developed to deposit patterns of ND monolayers from an unreactive water/glycerol ND ink to 5-\u03bcm resolution. The concentration and composition of the ND solution were optimized to realize high-density monolayers of NDs and consistent ND printing. Subsequent nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) patterns grown using chemical vapor deposition showed a high level of compliance with the printed ND pattern. This \"direct-write\", bottom-up, and additive process offers a versatile and simple alternative to pattern diamond. The process has the particular advantage that it does not require lithography or destructive processing such as reactive-ion etching (RIE) and, pertinently, does not involve reactive chemicals that could alter the surface chemistry of NDs. Furthermore, given that this process obviates the use of conventional lithography, substrates that are not suitable for lithographic processing (e.g., excessively small or three-dimensional structured substrates) can be inscribed with ND patterns. The technique also allows for the growth of discrete, localized, single-crystal nanodiamonds with applications in quantum technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diamond", "direct-write", "microwave plasma-enhanced CVD", "nanodiamond", "patterning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conventional lithography", "Direct write", "Lithographic processing", "Micro electromechanical system (MEMS)", "Microwave plasma-enhanced CVD", "Nanocrystalline diamond films", "Nanocrystalline diamonds", "patterning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926355486", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57208041325": {"Name": "Taylor A.C.", "AuthorID": "57208041325", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35975864500": {"Name": "Edgington R.", "AuthorID": "35975864500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "22992826600": {"Name": "Jackman R.B.", "AuthorID": "22992826600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
