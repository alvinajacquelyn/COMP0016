The authors therefore sought to measure vessel caliber in eyes with vasculitis. Methods: Retrospective case-control study. Vasculitis was confirmed using fluorescein angiography. Vessel calibers were measured using validated semiautomated software. Results: There were 21 eyes from 15 patients with vasculitis and 33 control eyes from 21 control subjects. Most cases were diagnosed with idiopathic vasculitis. All had periphlebitis, and one eye also had arteritis. After adjustment for age and gender, mean arteriolar caliber was 143 m (95% confidence interval [CI], 134-152) in cases and 158 m (95% CI, 151-165) in controls (P 0.01). Venular caliber was similar in cases (229 m; 95% CI, 215-243) and controls (228 m; 95% CI, 217-234; P 0.91), whereas arteriole-to-venule ratio was smaller in cases (0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.66) compared with controls (0.70; 95% CI, 0.02-0.11; P 0.004). Conclusion: Retinal vasculitis was associated with narrower arteriolar caliber, whereas venular caliber was similar to controls. This resulted in a smaller arteriole-to-venule ratio in eyes with vasculitis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arteritis", "inflammation", "periphlebitis", "retinal vessel", "vasculitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arterioles", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Photography", "Retinal Artery", "Retinal Vasculitis", "Retinal Vein", "Retrospective Studies", "Venules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926174670", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"12796147900": {"Name": "Liew G.", "AuthorID": "12796147900", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60003992", "AffiliationName": "Center for Vision Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.A.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Kean P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.A.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7003910861": {"Name": "Westcott M.C.", "AuthorID": "7003910861", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55712827400": {"Name": "Lee R.W.J.", "AuthorID": "55712827400", "AffiliationID": "60016719, 60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Eye Hospital, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.E.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "36503895600": {"Name": "Cosatto V.F.", "AuthorID": "36503895600", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60003992", "AffiliationName": "Center for Vision Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney"}, "7201883710": {"Name": "Tan A.G.", "AuthorID": "7201883710", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60003992", "AffiliationName": "Center for Vision Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney"}, "7402933815": {"Name": "Mitchell P.", "AuthorID": "7402933815", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60003992", "AffiliationName": "Center for Vision Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney"}, "24725877200": {"Name": "Zarranz-Ventura J.", "AuthorID": "24725877200", "AffiliationID": "60016719, 60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Eye Hospital, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
