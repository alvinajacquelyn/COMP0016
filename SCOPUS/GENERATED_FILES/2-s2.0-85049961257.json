We firstly split the antennas into two groups, one for radar and the other for communication. With this separated deployment, the radar signal is designed to fall into the null-space of the downlink communication channel. The communication beamformer is optimized such that the obtained beampattern matches the radar's beampattern while satisfying the performance requirements of the downlink users. We further consider a second operational option, where all the antennas transmit a joint waveform that is shared by both radar and communications, and formulate an appropriate beampattern while guaranteeing the downlink cellular transmission. Numerical results show that both methods are able to realize the simultaneous radar detection and wireless information transfer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Downlink communications", "Information transfers", "Joint beamforming", "Multi input multi output", "Multiuser communication", "Numerical results", "Performance requirements", "Radar communication"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049961257", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35766946500": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "35766946500", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36043733600": {"Name": "Hanzo L.", "AuthorID": "36043733600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}}}
