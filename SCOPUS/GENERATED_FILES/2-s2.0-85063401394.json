Background: Down syndrome (DS), caused by chromosome 21 trisomy, is associated with an ultra-high risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), driven by amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene triplication. Understanding relevant molecular differences between those with DS, those with sporadic AD (sAD) without DS, and controls will aid in understanding AD development in DS. We explored group differences in plasma concentrations of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and tau (as their accumulation is a characteristic feature of AD) and cytokines (as the inflammatory response has been implicated in AD development, and immune dysfunction is common in DS). Methods: We used ultrasensitive assays to compare plasma concentrations of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptides A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b2 42 , total tau (t-tau), and the cytokines IL1\u03b2, IL10, IL6, and TNF\u03b1 between adults with DS (n = 31), adults with sAD (n = 27), and controls age-matched to the group with DS (n = 27), and explored relationships between molecular concentrations and with age within each group. In the group with DS, we also explored relationships with neurofilament light (NfL) concentration, due to its potential use as a biomarker for AD in DS. Results: A\u03b2 40 , A\u03b2 42 , and IL1\u03b2 concentrations were higher in DS, with a higher A\u03b2 42 /A\u03b2 40 ratio in controls. The group with DS showed moderate positive associations between concentrations of t-tau and both A\u03b2 42 and IL1\u03b2. Only NfL concentration in the group with DS showed a significant positive association with age. Conclusions: Concentrations of A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b2 42 were much higher in adults with DS than in other groups, reflecting APP gene triplication, while no difference in the A\u03b2 42 /A\u03b2 40 ratio between those with DS and sAD may indicate similar processing and deposition of A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b2 42 in these groups. Higher concentrations of IL1\u03b2 in DS may reflect an increased vulnerability to infections and/or an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders, while the positive association between IL1\u03b2 and t-tau in DS may indicate IL1\u03b2 is associated with neurodegeneration. Finally, NfL concentration may be the most suitable biomarker for dementia progression in DS. The identification of such a biomarker is important to improve the detection of dementia and monitor its progression, and for designing clinical intervention studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid", "Biomarker", "Cytokines", "Dementia", "Down syndrome", "Interleukin 1\u03b2", "Plasma", "Tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Biomarkers", "Cytokines", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "tau Proteins", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063401394", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"48663029800": {"Name": "Startin C.M.", "AuthorID": "48663029800", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium)"}, "57189298391": {"Name": "Hamburg S.", "AuthorID": "57189298391", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium)"}, "55849059400": {"Name": "Hithersay R.", "AuthorID": "55849059400", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium)"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium (London Down Syndrome Consortium)"}, "14520663000": {"Name": "Wiseman F.K.", "AuthorID": "14520663000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36437536800": {"Name": "Mok K.Y.", "AuthorID": "36437536800", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55498735800": {"Name": "Ashton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55498735800", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Centre for Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603434972": {"Name": "Hye A.", "AuthorID": "6603434972", "AffiliationID": "60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "6701565311": {"Name": "Lle\u00f3 A.", "AuthorID": "6701565311", "AffiliationID": "60009466", "AffiliationName": "Memory Unit, Neurology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau"}, "7005575001": {"Name": "Lovestone S.", "AuthorID": "7005575001", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "35412328100": {"Name": "Parnetti L.", "AuthorID": "35412328100", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Memory Disturbances, Laboratory of Clinical Neurochemistry, Section of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia"}, "57203069236": {"Name": "Fisher E.", "AuthorID": "57203069236", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003483313": {"Name": "Nizetic D.", "AuthorID": "7003483313", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003735726": {"Name": "Tybulewicz V.", "AuthorID": "7003735726", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003649617": {"Name": "Karmiloff-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "7003649617", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56764220000": {"Name": "Al-Janabi T.", "AuthorID": "56764220000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57205657310": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "57205657310", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
