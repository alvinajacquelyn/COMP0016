There are no existing longitudinal studies of inflammatory markers and atopic disorders in childhood and risk of hypomanic symptoms in adulthood. This study examined if childhood: (1) serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP); and (2) asthma and/or eczema are associated with features of hypomania in young adulthood. Method. Participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective general population UK birth cohort, had non-fasting blood samples for IL-6 and CRP measurement at the age of 9 years (n = 4645), and parents answered a question about doctor-diagnosed atopic illness before the age of 10 years (n = 7809). These participants completed the Hypomania Checklist at age 22 years (n = 3361). Results. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, past psychological and behavioural problems, body mass index and maternal postnatal depression, participants in the top third of IL-6 values at 9 years, compared with the bottom third, had an increased risk of hypomanic symptoms by age 22 years [adjusted odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-2.85, p < 0.001]. Higher IL-6 levels in childhood were associated with adult hypomania features in a dose-response fashion. After further adjustment for depression at the age of 18 years this association remained (adjusted odds ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.03-2.81, p = 0.038). There was no evidence of an association of hypomanic symptoms with CRP levels, asthma or eczema in childhood. Conclusions. Higher levels of systemic inflammatory marker IL-6 in childhood were associated with hypomanic symptoms in young adulthood, suggesting that inflammation may play a role in the pathophysiology of mania. Inflammatory pathways may be suitable targets for the prevention and intervention for bipolar disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atopic disorders", "cohort studies", "hypomania", "inflammation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Asthma", "Bipolar Disorder", "C-Reactive Protein", "Child", "Eczema", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980349780", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36518630100": {"Name": "Hayes J.F.", "AuthorID": "36518630100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "7101639320": {"Name": "Osborn D.P.J.", "AuthorID": "7101639320", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "24461777700": {"Name": "Khandaker G.M.", "AuthorID": "24461777700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57212280457": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "57212280457", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "12760252100": {"Name": "MacKay D.", "AuthorID": "12760252100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "24469036100": {"Name": "Smith D.J.", "AuthorID": "24469036100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "6603745740": {"Name": "Zammit S.", "AuthorID": "6603745740", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
