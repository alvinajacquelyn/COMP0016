We investigate three different methods to gain information on the phase coherence length of the nanowires: first through the study of universal conductance fluctuations as a function of both magnetic field and gate voltage and then through localisation effects. The analysis of these different quantum effects gave consistent results and a phase-coherence length in the hundred nanometre range was extracted for all nanowires below 10 K. This demonstrates the potential of catalyst-free nanowires as building blocks for future quantum electronics devices directly integrated with silicon circuits.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Building blockes", "Electron transport", "Gain information", "Phase-coherence length", "Phase-coherent transport", "Silicon (111) substrates", "Silicon circuits", "Universal conductance fluctuations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009726356", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55551940600": {"Name": "Sourribes M.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55551940600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}, "55551834500": {"Name": "Isakov I.", "AuthorID": "55551834500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}, "57188646362": {"Name": "Panfilova M.", "AuthorID": "57188646362", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}, "7005264376": {"Name": "Warburton P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005264376", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}}}
