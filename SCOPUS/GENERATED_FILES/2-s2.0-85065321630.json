Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Overcoming P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux is a strategy to improve the absorption and pharmacokinetics of its substrate drugs. Berberine inhibits P-gp and thereby increases the bioavailability of the P-gp substrate digoxin in rodents. However, the effects of berberine on P-gp in chickens are still unclear. Here, we studied the role of berberine in modulating broilers P-p expression and function through both in situ and in vitro models. In addition, molecular docking was applied to analyze the interactions of berberine with P-gp as well as with chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR). The results showed that the mRNA expression levels of chicken P-gp and CXR decreased in the ileum following exposure to berberine. The absorption rate constant of rhodamine 123 increased after berberine treatment, as detected using an in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model. Efflux ratios of P-gp substrates (tilmicosin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, ampicillin, and enrofloxacin) decreased and the apparent permeability coe_cients increased after co-incubation with berberine in MDCK-chAbcb1 cell models. Bidirectional assay results showed that berberine could be transported by chicken P-gp with a transport ratio of 4.20, and this was attenuated by verapamil (an inhibitor of P-gp), which resulted in a ratio of 1.13. Molecular docking revealed that berberine could form favorable interactions with the binding pockets of both CXR and P-gp, with docking scores of -7.8 and -9.5 kcal/mol, respectively. These results indicate that berberine is a substrate of chicken P-gp and down-regulates P-gp expression in chicken tissues, thereby increasing the absorption of P-gp substrates. Our findings suggest that berberine increases the bioavailability of other drugs and that drug-drug interactions should be considered when it is co-administered with other P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic windows.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Berberine", "Chicken", "Inhibition", "MDCK-chAbcb1 cell line", "P-glycoprotein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1", "Avian Proteins", "Berberine", "Chickens", "Dogs", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "RNA, Messenger", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065321630", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57207473510": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207473510", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University"}, "57184614700": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "57184614700", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University"}, "56037956800": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56037956800", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University"}, "57184487500": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "57184487500", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University"}, "57198506596": {"Name": "He F.", "AuthorID": "57198506596", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University"}, "57188659580": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57188659580", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "110023850", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University Business Academy"}}}
