The major issue now is the ability of textile specialists and archaeobotanists to distinguish the technology of splicing from draft-spun fibres. This paper defines the major types of splicing and proposes an explicit method to observe, identify and interpret spliced thread technology. The identification of spliced yarns is evaluated through the examination of textiles from Europe, Egypt and the Near East. Through the application of this method, we propose that the switch from splicing to draft spinning plant fibres occurred much later than previously thought. The ramifications of this shift in plant processing have profound implications for understanding the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire of this ubiquitous and time-consuming technology, which will have to be factored into social and economic reconstructions of the past.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Identification method", "Plant bast fibre", "SEM", "Spinning", "Splicing", "Technology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050668514", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"26323642300": {"Name": "Gleba M.", "AuthorID": "26323642300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}, "25921155900": {"Name": "Harris S.", "AuthorID": "25921155900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Humanities, University of Glasgow"}}}
