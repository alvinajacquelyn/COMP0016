However, there is growing evidence that the particular effects of these social traits may also depend on local environmental conditions. We investigated this by comparing the foraging behavior of wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, under natural conditions and in a field experiment where food was spatially clumped. Data were collected from 55 animals across two troops over a 5-month period, including over 900 agonistic foraging interactions and over 600 food patch visits in each condition. In both conditions, low-ranked individuals received more agonism, but this only translated into reduced foraging performances for low-ranked individuals in the high-competition experimental conditions. Our results suggest one possible reason for this pattern may be low-ranked individuals strategically investing social effort to negotiate foraging tolerance, but the rank-offsetting effect of this investment being overwhelmed in the higher-competition experimental environment. Our results also suggest that individuals may use imbalances in their social bonds to negotiate tolerance from others under a wider range of environmental conditions, but utilize the overall strength of their social bonds in more extreme environments where feeding competition is more intense. These findings highlight that behavioral tactics such as the strategic investment of social effort may allow foragers to mitigate the costs of low rank, but that the effectiveness of these tactics is likely to be limited in certain environments. Understanding how social effects on foraging behaviour depend on environmental conditions is important in assessing how the costs and benefits of sociality vary across environments and predicting how social animals might be affected by environmental change. We find evidence that chacma baboons are able to offset the foraging costs of low-rank using mitigation tactics such as the use of social bonds. However, the effectiveness of these tactic appears to have ecological limits as, whilst rank did not affect foraging performance in a low-competition environment, it did affect foraging performance in a high-competition environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dominance rank", "Field experiment", "Papio ursinus", "Primate", "Social bonds", "Social tactics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921435844", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"35974978800": {"Name": "Marshall H.", "AuthorID": "35974978800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter"}, "15831049200": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "15831049200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Large Animal Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "55675553300": {"Name": "Ashford A.", "AuthorID": "55675553300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ecology and Evolution, Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "6701682562": {"Name": "Rowcliffe J.", "AuthorID": "6701682562", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7004446420": {"Name": "Cowlishaw G.", "AuthorID": "7004446420", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
