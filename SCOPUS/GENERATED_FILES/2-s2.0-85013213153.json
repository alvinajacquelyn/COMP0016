In this report, we for the first time covalently conjugate photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) to polyethylene glycol modified layered double hydroxides and produce hybrid nanoflakes. These nanoflakes display many superior characteristics and lead to excellent in vivo photodynamic therapeutic efficiency and safety profiles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013213153", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55793238000": {"Name": "Yan L.", "AuthorID": "55793238000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "7003498439": {"Name": "Gou X.J.", "AuthorID": "7003498439", "AffiliationID": "60102085, 60073505", "AffiliationName": "Antibiotics Research and Re-evaluation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics (SIIA), Chengdu University"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55910834500": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "55910834500", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "40561309900": {"Name": "Lan M.", "AuthorID": "40561309900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "57189326302": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "57189326302", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "57216834875": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57216834875", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55451894000": {"Name": "Zhu G.", "AuthorID": "55451894000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55936425600": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "55936425600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Bioengineering, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}}}
