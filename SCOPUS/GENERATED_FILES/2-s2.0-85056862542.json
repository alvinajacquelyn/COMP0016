Its industrial use is as a light-weight structural material. As a powerful three-dimensional (3D) imaging tool at the nano-scale, the serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) was employed to investigate the specimens. After being 3D reconstructed, the images were visualized to identify preference for several specific intermetallics by quantitative analysis. It was found that these phases have certain relationships in spatial distribution and differences in spatial shapes. The spatial distribution of cracks was studied to understand their propagation and growth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D microstructure reconstruction", "Aluminum alloy", "Crack propagation", "Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM)", "Spatial morphology"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D microstructures", "Aluminum silicons", "Casting aluminum alloys", "Industrial use", "Phase distribution", "Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM)", "Spatial morphologies", "Three dimensional (3-D) imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056862542", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57200213841": {"Name": "Lu J.", "AuthorID": "57200213841", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "57212182785": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "57212182785", "AffiliationID": "60073652, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Performance Evolution and Control for Engineering Structures of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University"}, "23501649700": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "23501649700", "AffiliationID": "60073652, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Civil Engineering Materials (Tongji University), Ministry of Education"}, "57202745450": {"Name": "Yang F.", "AuthorID": "57202745450", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60025119, 60006221", "AffiliationName": "Division of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}}}
