We aim to bring together researchers, students and practitioners working on technical infrastructures, studies and designs of spatial interfaces, or domain specific multi-device applications that use space as a unit of analysis. We focus specifically on analysing how such interfaces, tools and tracking technology can be deployed \"in the wild\". The workshop will facilitate knowledge exchange about the current state of spatial and proxemic interactive systems, identify application domains and enabling technologies for cross-surface interactions in the wild, and establish a research community to develop effective strategies for successful design of cross-device interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Configuration", "Cross-surface interaction", "Multi-device interactions", "Multi-screen workplaces", "Multisurface interactions", "Proxemic interaction", "Spatial reconfigurations of displays", "Spatially distributed interfaces", "Ubicomp ecologies", "Wearable devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Configuration", "Distributed interfaces", "Multi screens", "Multi-devices", "Multi-surface interaction", "Proxemic interaction", "Surface interactions", "Ubicomp", "Wearable devices"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005939362", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"55247206500": {"Name": "Houben S.", "AuthorID": "55247206500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre, ICRI Cities"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre, ICRI Cities"}, "57200009317": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ning J.", "AuthorID": "57200009317", "AffiliationID": "60010413", "AffiliationName": "Expertise Centre for Digital Media, Hasselt University, tUL, iMinds"}, "25723878600": {"Name": "Vermeulen J.", "AuthorID": "25723878600", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"}, "23392583100": {"Name": "Klokmose C.", "AuthorID": "23392583100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University"}, "23398200600": {"Name": "Reiterer H.", "AuthorID": "23398200600", "AffiliationID": "60025525", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Konstanz"}}}
