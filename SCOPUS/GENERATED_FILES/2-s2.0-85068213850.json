Each user of such a platform has his own Wall and Newsfeed, as well as his own self-posting and re-posting activity. As a main result, using our developed model, we derive in closed form the probabilities that posts originating from a given user are found on the Wall and Newsfeed of any other. These probabilities are the solution of a linear system of equations. Conditions of existence of the solution are provided, and two ways of solving the system are proposed, one using matrix inversion and another using fixed-point iteration. Comparisons with simulations show the accuracy of our model and its robustness with respect to the modeling assumptions. Hence, this article introduces a novel measure which allows to rank users by their influence on the social platform, by taking into account not only the social graph structure, but also the platform design, user activity (self-and re-posting), as well as competition among posts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Developed model", "Fixed point iteration", "Linear system of equations", "Matrix inversions", "Model assumptions", "Performance analysis", "Platform design", "User activity"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068213850", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"17434191400": {"Name": "Giovanidis A.", "AuthorID": "17434191400", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60112307", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS-LIP6"}, "6602830271": {"Name": "Baynat B.", "AuthorID": "6602830271", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60112307", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS-LIP6"}, "57209608406": {"Name": "Vendeville A.", "AuthorID": "57209608406", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60112307", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS-LIP6"}}}
