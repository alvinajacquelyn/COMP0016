Here, we carried out a microscopy-based genome-wide human short interfering RNA screen and discovered a lysosome-localized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-like protein, GPR137B, that interacts with Rag GTPases, increases Rag localization and activity, and thereby regulates mTORC1 translocation and activity. High GPR137B expression can recruit and activate mTORC1 in the absence of amino acids. Furthermore, GPR137B also regulates the dissociation of activated Rag from lysosomes, suggesting that GPR137B controls a cycle of Rag activation and dissociation from lysosomes. GPR137B-knockout cells exhibited defective autophagy and an expanded lysosome compartment, similar to Rag-knockout cells. Like zebrafish RagA mutants, GPR137B-mutant zebrafish had upregulated TFEB target gene expression and an expanded lysosome compartment in microglia. Thus, GPR137B is a GPCR-like lysosomal regulatory protein that controls dynamic Rag and mTORC1 localization and activity as well as lysosome morphology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genome, Human", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Microglia", "Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065181989", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57208574849": {"Name": "Gan L.", "AuthorID": "57208574849", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "57213883062": {"Name": "Seki A.", "AuthorID": "57213883062", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "57191754918": {"Name": "Han K.", "AuthorID": "57191754918", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "8546094600": {"Name": "Hayer A.", "AuthorID": "8546094600", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "56861667400": {"Name": "Ge X.", "AuthorID": "56861667400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "57208586546": {"Name": "Lin J.", "AuthorID": "57208586546", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "35109042700": {"Name": "Dey G.", "AuthorID": "35109042700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "7403382771": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "7403382771", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University"}, "57037873400": {"Name": "Shen K.", "AuthorID": "57037873400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University"}, "43762044700": {"Name": "Iyer H.", "AuthorID": "43762044700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University"}, "7005855426": {"Name": "Talbot W.", "AuthorID": "7005855426", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University"}, "9275726200": {"Name": "Wollman R.", "AuthorID": "9275726200", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California"}}}
