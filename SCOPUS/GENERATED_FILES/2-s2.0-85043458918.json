Such a network can act like a 'swiss knife' for vision tasks; we call it an \"UberNet\" to indicate its overarching nature. The main contribution of this work consists in handling challenges that emerge when scaling up to many tasks. We introduce techniques that facilitate (i) training a deep architecture while relying on diverse training sets and (ii) training many (potentially unlimited) tasks with a limited memory budget. This allows us to train in an end-to-end manner a unified CNN architecture that jointly handles (a) boundary detection (b) normal estimation (c) saliency estimation (d) semantic segmentation (e) human part segmentation (f) semantic boundary detection, (g) region proposal generation and object detection. We obtain competitive performance while jointly addressing all tasks in 0.7 seconds on a GPU. Our system will be made publicly available.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary detection", "Competitive performance", "Convolutional neural network", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)", "Deep architectures", "High-level visions", "Semantic segmentation", "Unified architecture"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043458918", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"9250105400": {"Name": "Kokkinos I.", "AuthorID": "9250105400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research"}}}
