However, the findings of these studies vary by stage of disease and methodology. The recent description of the syndrome of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has refined our understanding of the natural history of cirrhosis. In this context, we review the regulatory mechanisms at play that contribute to the immune abnormalities described in advanced liver disease. Specifically, we review the evidence for epigenetic mechanisms regulating monocyte phenotype, and the role of checkpoint receptors on regulating innate and adaptive immune cell function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACLF", "Alcoholic hepatitis", "ALD", "ARLD", "Cirrhosis", "Immune checkpoint", "Innate immune cell", "Myeloid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Leukocyte Count", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Function Tests", "Macrophages", "Monocytes", "Phenotype", "Receptors, Immunologic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062194613", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"24436349800": {"Name": "Riva A.", "AuthorID": "24436349800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "55212366100": {"Name": "Mehta G.", "AuthorID": "55212366100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}}}
