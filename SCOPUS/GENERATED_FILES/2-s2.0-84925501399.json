All wild-type cases for IDH1 R132 substitutions were also tested for IDH2 R172 and R140 alterations. The primary tumour and the most recent relapse sample were tested for p16/CDKN2A by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation. An additional 120 central cartilaginous tumours from different patients were also tested for p16/CDKN2A copy number. The study shows that if an IDH1 mutation were detected in a primary central chondrosarcoma, it is always detected at the time of presentation, and the same mutation is detected in local recurrences and metastatic events. We show that p16/CDKN2A copy number variation occurs subsequent to the IDH1 mutation, and confirm that p16/CDKN2A copy number variation occurs in 75 % of high grade central chondrosarcomas, and not in low grade cartilaginous tumours. Finally, p16/CDKN2A copy number variation is seen in both the IDH1 wild-type and mutant cartilaginous central tumours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chondrosarcomas", "IDH1", "p16/CDKN2A", "Sarcoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bone Neoplasms", "Chondrosarcoma", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Genes, p16", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925501399", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6504346616": {"Name": "Amary M.F.", "AuthorID": "6504346616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7201887595": {"Name": "Ye H.", "AuthorID": "7201887595", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Surgery, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "56430548100": {"Name": "Forbes G.", "AuthorID": "56430548100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Surgery, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "57190488908": {"Name": "Damato S.", "AuthorID": "57190488908", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Surgery, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "22135639100": {"Name": "Maggiani F.", "AuthorID": "22135639100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Surgery, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "55424579500": {"Name": "Pollock R.", "AuthorID": "55424579500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Surgery, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "24391733800": {"Name": "Tirabosco R.", "AuthorID": "24391733800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Surgery, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "7006896813": {"Name": "Flanagan A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006896813", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Paul O\u2019Gorman UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
