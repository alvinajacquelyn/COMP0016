The potential to foster new forms of multisensory interaction through various sensor, mobile and haptic technologies is promising in providing new ways for young children to engage with key mathematical concepts. However, designing effective learning environments for real world classrooms is challenging, and requires a pedagogically, rather than technologically, driven approach to design. This paper describes initial work underpinning the development of a pedagogical framework, intended to inform the design of a multisensory serious gaming environment. It identifies the theoretical basis of the framework, illustrates how this informs teaching strategies, and outlines key technology research driven perspectives and considerations important for informing design. An initial table mapping mathematical concepts to design, a framework of considerations for design, and a process model of how the framework will continue to be developed across the design process are provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education", "Interaction design", "Participatory design", "Ubiquitous and mobile computing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Effective Learning Environment", "Embodied cognition", "Haptic technology", "Interaction design", "Mathematical concepts", "Multisensory interaction", "Participatory design", "Teaching strategy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046537502", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"16234800800": {"Name": "Price S.", "AuthorID": "16234800800", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London, Institute of Education"}, "57202955430": {"Name": "Duffy S.", "AuthorID": "57202955430", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London, Institute of Education"}, "23491803400": {"Name": "Gori M.", "AuthorID": "23491803400", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Robotics Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}}}
