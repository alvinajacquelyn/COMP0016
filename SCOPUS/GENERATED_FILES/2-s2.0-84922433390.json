All rights reserved.The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries-climate change and biosphere integrity-have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmosphere", "Biological Evolution", "Climate Change", "Earth (Planet)", "Fresh Water", "Humans", "Ozone Depletion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922433390", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7005295903": {"Name": "Steffen W.", "AuthorID": "7005295903", "AffiliationID": "60082291, 60008950", "AffiliationName": "Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University"}, "6603746245": {"Name": "Rockstr\u00f6m J.", "AuthorID": "6603746245", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University"}, "55096139600": {"Name": "Cornell S.E.", "AuthorID": "55096139600", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University"}, "23988425300": {"Name": "Fetzer I.", "AuthorID": "23988425300", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University"}, "16232203200": {"Name": "Biggs R.", "AuthorID": "16232203200", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Studies in Complexity, Stellenbosch University"}, "7006090884": {"Name": "Folke C.", "AuthorID": "7006090884", "AffiliationID": "60001785", "AffiliationName": "Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences"}, "6603004274": {"Name": "Reyers B.", "AuthorID": "6603004274", "AffiliationID": "60013272", "AffiliationName": "Natural Resources and the Environment, CSIR"}, "7202201972": {"Name": "Richardson K.", "AuthorID": "7202201972", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Center for Macroecology, Evolution, and Climate, University of Copenhagen, Natural History Museum of Denmark"}, "7201460901": {"Name": "Bennett E.M.", "AuthorID": "7201460901", "AffiliationID": "60059360", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Resource Sciences, McGill School of Environment, McGill University"}, "55630395300": {"Name": "Carpenter S.R.", "AuthorID": "55630395300", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin"}, "7102036739": {"Name": "De Vries W.", "AuthorID": "7102036739", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Systems Analysis Group, Wageningen University"}, "7005808757": {"Name": "De Wit C.A.", "AuthorID": "7005808757", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry, Stockholm University"}, "6602972127": {"Name": "Gerten D.", "AuthorID": "6602972127", "AffiliationID": "60025182", "AffiliationName": "Research Domain Earth System Analysis, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)"}, "36177721100": {"Name": "Heinke J.", "AuthorID": "36177721100", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization)"}, "7006595259": {"Name": "Mace G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006595259", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research (CBER), Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7202840787": {"Name": "Persson L.M.", "AuthorID": "7202840787", "AffiliationID": "60015157", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Environment Institute"}, "13406672500": {"Name": "Ramanathan V.", "AuthorID": "13406672500", "AffiliationID": "60115214", "AffiliationName": "TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) University"}, "23028472400": {"Name": "S\u00f6rlin S.", "AuthorID": "23028472400", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Division of History of Science, Technology and Environment, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}}}
