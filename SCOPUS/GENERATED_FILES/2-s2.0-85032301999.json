However, visualization of a massive number of images is a very time-consuming and tedious task for physicians (prone to human error). Thus, an automatic scheme for lesion detection in WCE videos is a potential solution to alleviate this problem. In this work, a novel statistical approach was chosen for differentiating ulcer and non-ulcer pixels using various color spaces (or more specifically using relevant color bands). The chosen feature vector was used to compute the performance metrics using SVM with grid search method for maximum efficiency. The experimental results and analysis showed that the proposed algorithm was robust in detecting ulcers. The performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 97.89%, 96.22%, and 95.09%, respectively, which is promising.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Color space selection", "Feature selection", "Grid search", "Overlapping area", "Statistical analysis", "Support vector machine", "Wireless capsule endoscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032301999", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56412524700": {"Name": "Suman S.", "AuthorID": "56412524700", "AffiliationID": "60001278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS"}, "21742658500": {"Name": "Hussin F.", "AuthorID": "21742658500", "AffiliationID": "60001278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS"}, "12800348400": {"Name": "Malik A.", "AuthorID": "12800348400", "AffiliationID": "60001278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS"}, "50561284200": {"Name": "Ho S.", "AuthorID": "50561284200", "AffiliationID": "60013665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Center"}, "12780634900": {"Name": "Hilmi I.", "AuthorID": "12780634900", "AffiliationID": "60013665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Center"}, "56256095500": {"Name": "Leow A.", "AuthorID": "56256095500", "AffiliationID": "60013665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Center"}, "7201860992": {"Name": "Goh K.", "AuthorID": "7201860992", "AffiliationID": "60013665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Center"}}}
