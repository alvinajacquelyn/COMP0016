Nowadays, there is a cumulative interest in enhancing multi-stakeholder decision-making processes, overtaking binding mercantile business, in water management domain. This requires the development of dynamic decision-aiding tools able to integrate the different problem frames held by the decision makers, to clarify the differences, to support the creation of collaborative decision-making processes and to provide shared platforms of interactions. In literature, these issues are faced by concepts such as Ostrom's action arena and Ostanello-Tsouki\u00e0s\u2019 interaction space (IS). The analysis of the interactions structure and of the different problem framing involved are fundamental premises for a successful debate for the management of a common-pool resource. Specifically, the present paper suggests a dynamic evolution of the IS, highlighting its criticalities. It develops an alternative perspective on the problem, using a System Dynamics Model (SDM), exploring how different actions can influence the decision-making processes of various stakeholders involved in the IS. The SDM has been implemented in a multi-stakeholders decision-making situation in order to support water management and groundwater protection in the agricultural systems in the Capitanata area (Apulia region, Southern Italy).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision analysis", "Interactions space", "Participatory modelling", "Sustainability", "System dynamics", "Water management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Decision Making", "Decision Support Techniques", "Environmental Policy", "Italy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049442191", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55872771600": {"Name": "Pluchinotta I.", "AuthorID": "55872771600", "AffiliationID": "60008924, 60105740, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "LAMSADE-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine, PSL Research University"}, "6602780125": {"Name": "Tsouki\u00e0s A.", "AuthorID": "6602780125", "AffiliationID": "60008924, 60105740, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "LAMSADE-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine, PSL Research University"}, "57220534275": {"Name": "Pagano A.", "AuthorID": "57220534275", "AffiliationID": "60102148", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Institute - National Research Council"}, "55708830500": {"Name": "Giordano R.", "AuthorID": "55708830500", "AffiliationID": "60102148", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Institute - National Research Council"}}}
