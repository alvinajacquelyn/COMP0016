With this approach, DNA probes complementary to target mRNAs trigger chain reactions in which metastable fluorophore-labeled DNA hairpins self-assemble into fluorescent amplification polymers. The formation of the specific polymers enhances greatly the sensitivity of multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization. In this study we describe the optimal parameters (hybridization chain reaction time and temperature, hairpin and salt concentration) for multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization via amplification of hybridization chain reaction for frozen tissue sections. The combined use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, together with other control experiments (sense probe, neutralization and competition, RNase treatment, and anti-sense probe without initiator) confirmed the high specificity of the fluorescence in situ hybridization used in this study. Two sets of three different mRNAs for oxytocin, vasopressin and somatostatin or oxytocin, vasopressin and thyrotropin releasing hormone were successfully visualized via this new method. We believe that this modified protocol for multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization via hybridization chain reaction would allow researchers to visualize multiple target nucleic acids in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain section", "Hybridization chain reaction", "Multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Frozen Sections", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Rats", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990909892", "SubjectAreas": [["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57188927068": {"Name": "Sui Q.q.", "AuthorID": "57188927068", "AffiliationID": "60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Second Military Medical University"}, "56518387600": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "56518387600", "AffiliationID": "60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Second Military Medical University"}, "7402284736": {"Name": "He C.", "AuthorID": "7402284736", "AffiliationID": "60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Second Military Medical University"}, "7102138871": {"Name": "Xiang Z.", "AuthorID": "7102138871", "AffiliationID": "60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Second Military Medical University"}, "36604831200": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "36604831200", "AffiliationID": "116766401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, The Third People\u2019s Hospital of Yancheng"}, "35217025200": {"Name": "Yuan H.", "AuthorID": "35217025200", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "7203075925": {"Name": "Knight G.E.", "AuthorID": "7203075925", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Neuroscience Centre, University College Medical School"}, "36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}}}
