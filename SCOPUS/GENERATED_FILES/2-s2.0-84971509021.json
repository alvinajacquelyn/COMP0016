To this end, key enabling technologies, such as heterogeneous networks (HetNets), massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and millimeter wave (mmWave) techniques, have been identified to bring 5G to fruition. Regardless of the technology adopted, a user association mechanism is needed to determine whether a user is associated with a particular base station (BS) before data transmission commences. User association plays a pivotal role in enhancing the load balancing, the spectrum efficiency, and the energy efficiency of networks. The emerging 5G networks introduce numerous challenges and opportunities for the design of sophisticated user association mechanisms. Hence, substantial research efforts are dedicated to the issues of user association in HetNets, massive MIMO networks, mmWave networks, and energy harvesting networks. We introduce a taxonomy as a framework for systematically studying the existing user association algorithms. Based on the proposed taxonomy, we then proceed to present an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art in user association algorithms conceived for HetNets, massive MIMO, mmWave, and energy harvesting networks. Finally, we summarize the challenges as well as opportunities of user association in 5G and provide design guidelines and potential solutions for sophisticated user association mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HetNets", "massive MIMO", "user association"], "IndexKeywords": ["Enabling technologies", "Heterogeneous network (HetNets)", "Hetnets", "Millimeter waves (mmwave)", "Research efforts", "Spectrum efficiency", "State of the art", "User associations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971509021", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55185074300": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "55185074300", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7601438779": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "7601438779", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602911293": {"Name": "Elkashlan M.", "AuthorID": "6602911293", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004473639": {"Name": "Schober R.", "AuthorID": "7004473639", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications (IDC), Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU)"}, "36043733600": {"Name": "Hanzo L.", "AuthorID": "36043733600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}}}
