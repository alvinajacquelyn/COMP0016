Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a wide spectrum of neuroimaging measures at the whole-brain, cervical, and CST level were analyzed in 195 patients with MS and 54 healthy controls. Motor function was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), 9-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, and Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale. Associations between damage in different parts of the motor system and motor functioning were assessed using stepwise linear regression. Results: Patients had an average disease duration of 19.98 (\u00b16.99) years and a median EDSS score of 4 (range: 1.0-8.0). EDSS score was associated with number of infratentorial and cervical cord lesions, lesion volume in the CST, and mean upper cervical cord area (adjusted R 2 0.403). Timed 25-Foot Walk Test score was associated with number of infratentorial lesions and cerebellar volume (adjusted R 2 0.150), 9-Hole Peg Test score with number of infratentorial lesions and thickness of the cortex connected to the CST (adjusted R 2 0.245), and Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale with number of infratentorial and cervical lesions, thickness of the cortex connected to the CST, and mean upper cervical cord area (adjusted R 2 0.354). Conclusions: Motor dysfunction in MS has a complex substrate that cannot be ascribed to a single neuroimaging finding, but is the consequence of infratentorial and spinal cord damage, as well as damage in the CST.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Skills Disorders", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neuroimaging", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937696171", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"16941642700": {"Name": "Daams M.", "AuthorID": "16941642700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "55653016200": {"Name": "Steenwijk M.", "AuthorID": "55653016200", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "8302719300": {"Name": "Wattjes M.", "AuthorID": "8302719300", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7006076844": {"Name": "Uitdehaag B.", "AuthorID": "7006076844", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "55189867500": {"Name": "Tewarie P.", "AuthorID": "55189867500", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "35200468000": {"Name": "Balk L.", "AuthorID": "35200468000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004423164": {"Name": "Killestein J.", "AuthorID": "7004423164", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7005232562": {"Name": "Pouwels P.", "AuthorID": "7005232562", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Physics and Medical Technology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}}}
