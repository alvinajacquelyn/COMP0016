PB has also diversified over its 30 years, with many contemporary experiments (referred to as PBs) only tangentially related to the original project to \u201cradically democratize democracy\u201d. We propose a taxonomy to distinguish the logics currently underpinning PB in practice: political (for radical democratic change), good governance (to improve links between the public and citizens\u2019 spheres), and technocratic (to optimize the use and transparency of public resources for citizens\u2019 benefit). Illustrating these competing rationales through contemporary experiences, we reflect on the contributions of the good governance and technocratic frameworks to managerial and state modernization. Undoubtedly, these help explain PB\u2019s growing attraction for proponents of the good governance agenda. However, rekindling PB\u2019s promise for democratic deepening, we argue, requires refocusing on its deliberative quality. We draw attention to civic education and empowerment of participants as key components of PB practices intent on opening pathways towards alternative political systems \u2013 indeed, of materializing Henri Lefebvre\u2019s \u201cright to the city\u201d.", "AuthorKeywords": ["democratization", "governance", "local governments", "participatory budgeting", "right to the city", "spatial justice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044958318", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"6603309100": {"Name": "Cabannes Y.", "AuthorID": "6603309100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23985320300": {"Name": "Lipietz B.", "AuthorID": "23985320300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, University College London"}}}
