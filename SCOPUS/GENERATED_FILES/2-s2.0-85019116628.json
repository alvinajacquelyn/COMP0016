To determine HIV-1 subtypes circulating in this population group and explore possible geographic differences, we analyzed HIV-1 sequences among drug users from Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu in Kenya. We sequenced gag and env from 55 drug users. Subtype analysis from 220 gag clonal sequences from 54 of 55 participants (median = 4/participant) showed that 44.4% were A, 16.7% were C, 3.7% were D, and 35.2% were intersubtype recombinants. Of 156 env clonal sequences from 48 of 55 subjects (median = 3/participant), 45.8% were subtype A, 14.6% were C, 6.3% were D, and 33.3% were recombinants. Comparative analysis of both genes showed that 30 (63.8%) participants had concordant subtypes, while 17 (36.2%) were discordant. We identified one genetically linked transmission pair and two cases of dual infection. These data are indicative of extensive HIV-1 intersubtype recombination in Kenya and suggest decline in subtype D prevalence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug users", "HIV-1 subtypes", "Intersubtype recombinants", "Kenya"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cities", "Coinfection", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Drug Users", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Female", "gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Kenya", "Male", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019116628", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56427744000": {"Name": "Gounder K.", "AuthorID": "56427744000", "AffiliationID": "60017135, 60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, Nelson R.
