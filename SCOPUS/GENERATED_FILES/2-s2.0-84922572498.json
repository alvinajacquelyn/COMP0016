Among these PEG linkers, only PEG\u223c4(OPCB)2 (4a) (OPCB: ester oxygen linked phenyl-C61-butyryl group) was successfully isolated from the crude product mixture in the fully end-capped form. Fully acylated PEG\u223c21(OPCB)3 (5) and PEG\u223c15(OPCB)4 (6) could not be separated chromatographically from incompletely reacted species due to the polydispersity in branch lengths. This purification challenge was overcome by using a monodisperse branched core, 1,3,5-tris(octagoloxymethyl)benzene [7, PEG24(OH)3] to give a monodisperse tris-fullerene homostar, PEG24(OPCB)3 (8). The structures of the bis- and tris-fullerene products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy with supporting FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopic analysis.
