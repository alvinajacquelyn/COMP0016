The use of electrosurgery carries with it inherent risks related to the use of an energy source within the abdomen. Inadvertent tissue injury due to the use of electrosurgical devices is rare, but is associated with a high morbidity and mortality if undetected. This paper describes a novel, yet simple method using instrument markers and image processing algorithms to reduce the risk of unsafe activation of electrosurgical instruments during laparoscopy. The method was tested in a simulated environment and measured against the decision of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Results showed that the position of an instrument in a visual field could be accurately determined using an image processing algorithm to ascertain whether it was safe for activation in agreement with the decisions made by manual inspection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diathermy", "Diathermy burn", "Electrosurgery", "Electrosurgical injury", "Laparoscopic surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Electrosurgery", "Equipment Design", "Laparoscopy", "Patient Safety", "electrosurgical injury", "Image processing algorithm", "Laparoscopic procedures", "Laparoscopic surgeons", "Laparoscopic surgery", "Manual inspection", "Safety mechanisms", "Simulated environment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964505061", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55950020500": {"Name": "van Duren B.H.", "AuthorID": "55950020500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics & Musculoskeletal Sciences, University College London"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics & Musculoskeletal Sciences, University College London"}, "55986352600": {"Name": "van Boxel G.I.", "AuthorID": "55986352600", "AffiliationID": "60005186", "AffiliationName": "Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57188976696": {"Name": "Newton N.", "AuthorID": "57188976696", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}}}
