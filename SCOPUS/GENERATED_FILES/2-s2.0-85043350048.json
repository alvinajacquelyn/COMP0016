Here, we studied the effects of CO liberated from CORM-401 on NO production, calcium signalling and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity in human endothelial cell line (EA.hy926). CORM-401 induced NO production and two types of calcium signalling: a peak-like calcium signal and a gradual increase in cytosolic calcium. CORM-401-induced peak-like calcium signal, originating from endoplasmic reticulum, was reduced by thapsigargin, a SERCA inhibitor, and by dantrolene, a ryanodine receptors (RyR) inhibitor. In contrast, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 did not significantly affect peak-like calcium signalling, but a slow and progressive CORM-401-induced increase in cytosolic calcium was dependent on store-operated calcium entrance. CORM-401 augmented coupling of endoplasmic reticulum and plasmalemmal store-operated calcium channels. Interestingly, in the presence of NO synthase inhibitor (l-NAME) CORM-401-induced increases in NO and cytosolic calcium were both abrogated. CORM-401-induced calcium signalling was also inhibited by superoxide dismutase (poly(ethylene glycol)-SOD). Furthermore, CORM-401 accelerated PPP, increased NADPH concentration and decreased the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG). Importantly, CORM-401-induced NO increase was inhibited by the PPP inhibitor 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN), but neither by dantrolene nor by an inhibitor of large-conductance calcium-regulated potassium ion channel (paxilline). The results identify the primary role of CO-induced NO increase in the regulation of endothelial calcium signalling, that may have important consequences in controlling endothelial function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calcium", "carbon monoxide", "endothelium", "nitric oxide", "pentose phosphate pathway"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium Signaling", "Carbon Monoxide", "Cell Line", "Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Nitric Oxide", "Pentose Phosphate Pathway", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043350048", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"35519725000": {"Name": "Kaczara P.", "AuthorID": "35519725000", "AffiliationID": "60021361", "AffiliationName": "Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics (JCET), Jagiellonian University"}, "56471857900": {"Name": "Proniewski B.", "AuthorID": "56471857900", "AffiliationID": "60021361", "AffiliationName": "Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics (JCET), Jagiellonian University"}, "55199908800": {"Name": "Kus K.", "AuthorID": "55199908800", "AffiliationID": "60021361", "AffiliationName": "Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics (JCET), Jagiellonian University"}, "7003634171": {"Name": "Chlopicki S.", "AuthorID": "7003634171", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57194546145": {"Name": "Lovejoy C.", "AuthorID": "57194546145", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003812361": {"Name": "Motterlini R.", "AuthorID": "7003812361", "AffiliationID": "60025066, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM Unit 955, Equipe 12, Faculty of Medicine, University Paris-Est"}}}
