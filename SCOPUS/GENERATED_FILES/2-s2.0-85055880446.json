Knowing the concentration of bilirubin in serum is important in evaluating the health of the liver, and for the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia (a condition that afflicts approximately 60% of full-term and 80% of pre-term newborns). This paper describes the design and fabrication of a potentiometric sensor for the determination of free bilirubin in serum. The sensor has a polymeric ion-selective membrane, and selectively measures free ionic bilirubin (\u201cunbound\u201d bilirubin \u2013 i.e., bilirubin not complexed to albumin or other complexing agents), in the presence of other anions \u2014 chloride, phosphate, pyruvate, deoxycholate, and lactate \u2014 also present in serum. The linear response range of the sensor (1.0 mM to 0.10 \u03bcM bilirubin, measured in a sodium phosphate buffer with pH 8.6) covers the clinically-relevant concentration of bilirubin in serum (5\u2013500 \u03bcM). Free bilirubin could be detected in human blood serum with this potentiometric sensor. The components of the potentiometric bilirubin sensor were embedded in a paper-based device to provide a sensor that is disposable and easy to use, and thus is suitable for applications at the point-of-care. The paper-based potentiometric bilirubin sensor exhibited a response range of 5.0\u20130.10 mM (sufficient to cover the clinically-relevant concentration of bilirubin in serum). Only 15 \u03bcL of sample is required for measurement of the concentration of free bilirubin, and the analysis can be performed in less than two minutes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Free bilirubin", "Ion-selective electrode", "Jaundice", "Liver damage", "Paper-based device", "Point-of-care diagnostics", "Potentiometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Free bilirubin", "Jaundice", "Liver damage", "Paper based devices", "Point of care diagnostic", "Potentiometry", "Bilirubin", "Biosensing Techniques", "Electrodes", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Hyperbilirubinemia", "Infant, Newborn", "Limit of Detection", "Male", "Paper", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Potentiometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055880446", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57201915114": {"Name": "Bell J.G.", "AuthorID": "57201915114", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University"}, "55698767900": {"Name": "Mousavi M.P.S.", "AuthorID": "55698767900", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University"}, "6603835532": {"Name": "Abd El-Rahman M.K.", "AuthorID": "6603835532", "AffiliationID": "60004782, 60010294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University"}, "57194707143": {"Name": "Tan E.K.W.", "AuthorID": "57194707143", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "55711979600": {"Name": "Whitesides G.M.", "AuthorID": "55711979600", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University of Warwick"}}}
