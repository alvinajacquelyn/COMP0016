Methods: Thirty-six CD patients (median age 26 years, 20 males) commencing anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy with concomitant baseline MRI enterography (MRE) were identified retrospectively. Patients\u2019 clinical course was followed and correlated with subsequent MREs. Scan order was randomised and MEGS (a global activity score) was applied by two blinded radiologists. A physician\u2019s global assessment of the disease activity (remission, mild, moderate or severe) at the time of MRE was assigned. The cohort was divided into clinical responders and non-responders and MEGS compared according to activity status and treatment response. Interobserver agreement was assessed. Results: Median MEGS decreased significantly between baseline and first follow-up in responders (28 versus 6, P < 0.001) but was unchanged in non-responders (26 versus 18, P = 0.28). The median MEGS was significantly lower in clinical remission (9) than in moderate (14) or severe (29) activity (P < 0.001). MEGS correlated significantly with clinical activity (r = 0.53; P < 0.001). Interobserver Bland-Altman limits of agreement (BA LoA) were -19.7 to 18.5. Conclusions: MEGS decreases significantly in clinical responders to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy but not in non-responders, demonstrates good interobserver agreement and moderate correlation with clinical disease activity. Key Points: \u2022 MRI scores of Crohn\u2019s activity are used increasingly in clinical practice and therapeutic trials. \u2022 Such scores have been advocated as biomarkers of therapeutic response. \u2022 MEGS reflects clinical response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy and the clinical classification of disease activity. \u2022 MEGS demonstrates good interobserver agreement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological therapy", "Crohn\u2019s disease", "Enterography", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Therapeutic monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Biomarkers", "Crohn Disease", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944571689", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35741623700": {"Name": "Prezzi D.", "AuthorID": "35741623700", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Imaging, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "37100960500": {"Name": "Bhatnagar G.", "AuthorID": "37100960500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "54400322900": {"Name": "Makanyanga J.", "AuthorID": "54400322900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "26027633500": {"Name": "Vega R.", "AuthorID": "26027633500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Services, University College Hospital"}}}
