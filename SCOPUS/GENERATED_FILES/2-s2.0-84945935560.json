Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in tumor glycolysis, controlling the balance between energy production and the synthesis of metabolic precursors. We report here the synthesis and evaluation of a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [11C]DASA-23, that provides a direct noninvasive measure of PKM2 expression in preclinical models of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In vivo, orthotopic U87 and GBM39 patient-derived tumors were clearly delineated from the surrounding normal brain tissue by PET imaging, corresponding to exclusive tumor-associated PKM2 expression. In addition, systemic treatment of mice with the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 resulted in complete abrogation of the PET signal in intracranial GBM39 tumors. Together, these data provide the basis for the clinical evaluation of imaging agents that target this important gatekeeper of tumor glycolysis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Carbon Radioisotopes", "Glycolysis", "Hexokinase", "Humans", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Pyruvate Kinase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945935560", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26641518000": {"Name": "Witney T.", "AuthorID": "26641518000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55612805100": {"Name": "James M.", "AuthorID": "55612805100", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University"}, "35801355800": {"Name": "Shen B.", "AuthorID": "35801355800", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "7401837542": {"Name": "Chang E.", "AuthorID": "7401837542", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "36663840400": {"Name": "Pohling C.", "AuthorID": "36663840400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "56183911700": {"Name": "Arksey N.", "AuthorID": "56183911700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "55359055300": {"Name": "Hoehne A.", "AuthorID": "55359055300", "AffiliationID": "109577531", "AffiliationName": "3B Pharmaceuticals GmbH"}, "6507905560": {"Name": "Shuhendler A.", "AuthorID": "6507905560", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "56937532200": {"Name": "Park J.", "AuthorID": "56937532200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "55957043300": {"Name": "Bodapati D.", "AuthorID": "55957043300", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "56937634800": {"Name": "Weber J.", "AuthorID": "56937634800", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "14021346200": {"Name": "Gowrishankar G.", "AuthorID": "14021346200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "7402367741": {"Name": "Rao J.", "AuthorID": "7402367741", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "7005101917": {"Name": "Chin F.", "AuthorID": "7005101917", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University"}, "7101904349": {"Name": "Gambhir S.", "AuthorID": "7101904349", "AffiliationID": "60091250, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Bioengineering and Materials Science and Engineering, Bio-X, Stanford University"}}}
