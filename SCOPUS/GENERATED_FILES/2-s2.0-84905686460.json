One of the main threats to this vulnerable population is mortalities through ship strikes. It is argued that a SPAMI network does not have the potential to effectively reduce the threat of ship strikes on a firm legal, scientific and political basis, particularly given uncertainty over fin whale seasonal movements. Instead, an alternative sectoral approach to landscape-scale protection is discussed. Building on examples from North America, it is proposed that a wider spatial scale threat-based approach should be adopted, and that a regional network of restrictions of shipping activities through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) will more effectively reduce the risk of ship-whale strikes. This is also more consistent with the ecosystem approach, since the emphasis is on ecological scales that cross administrative boundaries, even though it is within a single sector. It is concluded that mechanisms exist to address the challenges of implementing such an approach, and that sectoral measures through the IMO represent an important way forward for improving the conservation prospects for Mediterranean fin whales. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fin whales", "IMO", "Sectoral regulations", "SPAMI network", "Wide-ranging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84905686460", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55566361400": {"Name": "Geijer C.", "AuthorID": "55566361400", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Stockholm University"}, "55474784800": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "55474784800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
