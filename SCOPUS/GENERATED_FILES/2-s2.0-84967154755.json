All rights reserved.Rice husk from source in Cameroon was leached in HCl (5 M) to remove the most of metallic ingredients and then calcined at 600 \u00b0C in order to produce white rice husk ash. This white ash were applied for producing sodium waterglass with different molar ratios SiO2/Na2O (0.31; 0.47; 0.62; 0.78; 0.93; 1.09 and 1.25) and then used to synthesize metakaolin-based geopolymer cements. The obtained white rice husk ash shows the loss of crystalline mineral and reveals high amorphous silica with quartz as impurity. Geopolymers GPi (i varying from 1 to 7) were obtained using different synthesis sodium waterglass (NWG) with a mass ratio NWG/MK=0.87. It could be observed that the 28 days compressive strength (4/5/7/9/32/34/36 MPa) increase with increasing the molar ratios SiO2/Na2O defined in this work in the course GP1/GP2/GP3/GP4/GP5/GP6/GP7. The micrographs show the formation of more geopolymer gels when the molar ratios SiO2/Na2O in alkaline activators are between 0.93 and 1.25. Sodium waterglass from white rice husk ash proved to be an effective alkaline activator in geopolymers preparation. It can be concluded that it is possible to replace quartz sand and sodium carbonate which is responsible to greenhouse gas emitted during the production of commercial sodium silicate solution by using rice husk as silica sources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressive strength", "Geopolymers", "Metakaolin", "Rice husk", "Sodium hydroxide", "Sodium waterglass"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline activators", "Crystalline minerals", "Geopolymer cement", "Metakaolins", "Rice husk", "Sodium hydroxides", "Sodium silicate solutions", "White rice husk ashes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967154755", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"36775484500": {"Name": "Tchakout\u00e9 H.K.", "AuthorID": "36775484500", "AffiliationID": "60004935, 60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "56719117900": {"Name": "Kong S.", "AuthorID": "56719117900", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Inorganic Chemistry, University of Yaounde i, Faculty of Science, Department of Inorganic Chemistry"}, "56211635200": {"Name": "R\u00fcscher C.H.", "AuthorID": "56211635200", "AffiliationID": "60004935, 60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "55484588000": {"Name": "Ranjbar N.", "AuthorID": "55484588000", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaysia"}}}
