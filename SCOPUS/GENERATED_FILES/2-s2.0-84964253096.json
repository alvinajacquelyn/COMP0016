Comparisons are made between the ytterbium-based technology and titanium sapphire laser systems for time-resolved IR spectroscopy measurements. The 100 kHz probing system provides new capability in time-resolved multiple-probe experiments, as more information is obtained from samples in a single experiment through multiple-probing. This method uses the high repetition-rate probe pulses to repeatedly measure spectra at 10 \u03bcs intervals following excitation allowing extended timescales to be measured routinely along with ultrafast data. Results are presented showing the measurement of molecular dynamics over >10 orders of magnitude in timescale, out to 20 ms, with an experimental time response of <200 fs. The power of multiple-probing is explored through principal component analysis of repeating probe measurements as a novel method for removing noise and measurement artifacts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Laser", "Mid-infrared (Mid-IR)", "Multiple-probing", "Spectroscopy", "Time-resolved", "Ultrafast"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption spectrometers", "Mid infrared (mid IR)", "Multiple-probing", "Potassium-gadolinium tungstate", "Time-resolved", "Time-resolved IR spectroscopy", "Titanium sapphire laser", "Ultra-fast", "Equipment Design", "Lasers", "Principal Component Analysis", "Spectrophotometry, Infrared", "Tungsten Compounds", "Ytterbium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964253096", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"6603474634": {"Name": "Greetham G.M.", "AuthorID": "6603474634", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "21933651200": {"Name": "Donaldson P.M.", "AuthorID": "21933651200", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57204530674": {"Name": "Nation C.", "AuthorID": "57204530674", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6603168710": {"Name": "Sazanovich I.V.", "AuthorID": "6603168710", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7102140305": {"Name": "Clark I.P.", "AuthorID": "7102140305", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "35189646400": {"Name": "Shaw D.J.", "AuthorID": "35189646400", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, SUPA"}, "7403267977": {"Name": "Parker A.W.", "AuthorID": "7403267977", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7004415080": {"Name": "Towrie M.", "AuthorID": "7004415080", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
