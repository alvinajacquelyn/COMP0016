This workflow requires users to manually select the right render channels, prescribe channel-specific masks, and set appropriate edit parameters. Unfortunately, such edits cannot be easily reused for global variations of the original scene, such as a rigid-body transformation of the 3D objects or a modified viewpoint, which discourages iterative refinement of both global scene changes and image-based edits. We propose a method to automatically transfer such user edits across variations of object geometry, illumination, and viewpoint. This transfer problem is challenging since many edits may be visually plausible but nonphysical, with a successful transfer dependent on an unknown set of scene attributes that may include both photometric and non-photometric features. To address this challenge, we present a transfer algorithm that extends the image analogies formulation to include an augmented set of photometric and non-photometric guidance channels and, more importantly, adaptively estimate weights for the various candidate channels in a way that matches the characteristics of each individual edit. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of complex edit-transfer scenarios for creating high-quality product images.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Global variations", "High-quality products", "Iterative refinement", "Object geometries", "Photometric features", "Physically based", "Rigid body transformation", "Transfer problems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038947089", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56954660500": {"Name": "Hennessey J.W.", "AuthorID": "56954660500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7501790814": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "7501790814", "AffiliationID": "60076047", "AffiliationName": "Adobe Research"}, "7202346441": {"Name": "Russell B.", "AuthorID": "7202346441", "AffiliationID": "60076047", "AffiliationName": "Adobe Research"}, "55924548800": {"Name": "Shechtman E.", "AuthorID": "55924548800", "AffiliationID": "60076047", "AffiliationName": "Adobe Research"}, "7103161991": {"Name": "Mitra N.J.", "AuthorID": "7103161991", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
