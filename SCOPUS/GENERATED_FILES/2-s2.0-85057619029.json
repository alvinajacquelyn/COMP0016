It accounts for up to 6% of familial and approximately 1.5% of sporadic cases. LRRK2 has a kinase enzymatic domain which provides an attractive potential target for drug therapies and LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are in development. Prevalence of the p.G2019S has a variable ethnic and geographic distribution, the highest reported among Ashkenazi Jews (30% in patients with familial PD, 14% in sporadic PD, 2.0% in controls) and North African Berbers (37% in patients with familial PD, 41% in sporadic PD, and 1% in controls). Little is known about the frequency of the LRRK2 p.G2019S among populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Our group and others previously reported that the p.G2019S is absent in a small cohort of Nigerian PD patients and controls. Here we used Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assay to screen for the p.G2019S in a larger cohort of Black African PD patients (n = 126) and healthy controls (n = 54) from Nigeria. Our analysis confirmed that all patients and controls are negative for the p.G2019S mutation. This report provides further evidence that the LRRK2 p.G2019S is not implicated in PD in black populations from Nigeria and support the notion that p.G2019S mutation originated after the early human dispersal from sub-Saharan Africa. Further studies using larger cohorts and advance sequencing technology are required to underpin the genetic causes of PD in this region.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nigeria", "Parkinson Disease", "Point Mutation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Domains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057619029", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35580284300": {"Name": "Okubadejo N.U.", "AuthorID": "35580284300", "AffiliationID": "60026284, 60024019, 60006448", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Lagos and Lagos University Teaching Hospital"}, "35318197000": {"Name": "Ojo O.O.", "AuthorID": "35318197000", "AffiliationID": "60026284, 60024019, 60006448", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Lagos and Lagos University Teaching Hospital"}, "13007960600": {"Name": "Rizig M.", "AuthorID": "13007960600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "48761397800": {"Name": "Jonvik H.", "AuthorID": "48761397800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57220917878": {"Name": "Brown E.", "AuthorID": "57220917878", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "35318351400": {"Name": "Oshinaike O.", "AuthorID": "35318351400", "AffiliationID": "60026284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital"}}}
