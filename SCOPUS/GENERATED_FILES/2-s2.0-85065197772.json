Less is known about the psychological impact of delirium in patients and relatives. This study aimed to quantitatively describe distress related to postoperative delirium in older surgical patients and their relatives using the distress thermometer, examine the association between degree of distress and features of delirium on the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS), and examine the association between recall of delirium and features of delirium on the DRS. Methods: This prospective study recruited postoperative patients and their relatives following delirium. The distress thermometer was used to examine the degree of distress pertaining to delirium and was conducted during the hospitalization on resolution of delirium and then at 12-month follow-up. Associations between delirium-related distress in patient and relative participants and severity and features of delirium (DRS) were examined. Results: One hundred two patients and 49 relatives were recruited. Median scores on the distress thermometer in patients who recalled delirium were 8/10. Relatives also showed distress (median distress thermometer score of 8/10). Associations were observed between severity and phenotypic features of delirium (delusions, labile affect, and agitation). Distress persisted at 12 months in patients and relatives. Conclusion: Distress related to postoperative delirium can be measured using a distress thermometer. Alongside approaches to reduce delirium incidence, interventions to minimize distress from postoperative delirium should be sought. Such interventions should be developed through robust research and if effective administered to patients, relatives, or carers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carer and relative distress", "distress thermometer", "older people", "postoperative delirium", "psychological and emotional distress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anxiety", "Caregivers", "Delirium", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065197772", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57212783005": {"Name": "Partridge J.S.L.", "AuthorID": "57212783005", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "57208584234": {"Name": "Biswell E.", "AuthorID": "57208584234", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health and Ageing, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Older Persons Assessment Unit, Ground Floor Bermondsey Wing, Guy's Hospital"}, "7007148469": {"Name": "Harari D.", "AuthorID": "7007148469", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "6601975638": {"Name": "Dhesi J.K.", "AuthorID": "6601975638", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "34067584300": {"Name": "Crichton S.", "AuthorID": "34067584300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7403519729": {"Name": "Martin F.C.", "AuthorID": "7403519729", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Gerontology, King's College London"}}}
