For qubit systems subjected to unitary gates and projective measurements, we prove that any strategy in our game can be mapped to a strategy in the CHSH game, which implies that Tsirelson's bound also holds in our setting. More generally, we show that the optimal success probability depends on the reversible or irreversible character of the gates, the quantum or classical nature of the system, and the system dimension. We analyze the bounds obtained in light of Landauer's principle, showing the entropic costs of the erasure associated with the game. This demonstrates a connection between the reversibility in fundamental operations embodied by Landauer's principle and Tsirelson's bound that arises from the restricted physics of a unitarily evolving single-qubit system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clauser horne shimony holts", "Fundamental operations", "Landauer's principles", "Projective measurement", "Success probabilities", "System dimension", "Tsirelson's bounds", "Unitary gates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059414823", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57205283370": {"Name": "Henaut L.", "AuthorID": "57205283370", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "36522307000": {"Name": "Catani L.", "AuthorID": "36522307000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7102407945": {"Name": "Browne D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102407945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54387248300": {"Name": "Pappa A.", "AuthorID": "54387248300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55042480600": {"Name": "Mansfield S.", "AuthorID": "55042480600", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60112307", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6"}}}
