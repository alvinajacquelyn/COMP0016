The method combines the usual Galerkin/Least-Squares approach to achieve stability with a nonlinear consistent penalty term inspired by recent discretizations of contact problems to weakly enforce a positivity condition on the discrete solution. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of the discrete solution. Then we establish quasi-optimal error estimates for smooth solutions bounding the usual error terms in the Galerkin/Least-Squares error analysis together with the violation of the maximum principle by the discrete solution. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performances of the method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consistent penalty", "Discrete maximum principle", "Positivity preserving", "Stabilized finite element method", "Transport equation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Consistent penalty", "Discrete maximum principles", "Positivity preserving", "Stabilized finite element methods", "Transport equation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017284894", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7003701058": {"Name": "Ern A.", "AuthorID": "7003701058", "AffiliationID": "60085092, 60068569", "AffiliationName": "University Paris-Est, CERMICS (ENPC)"}}}
