The current experimental limit, |d\u03bc| < 1.9 \u00d7 10-19e\u00b7cm, was set by the BNL E821 experiment. This paper discusses how the new experiment at Fermilab, E989 [3], aims to decrease this by two orders of magnitude down to 10-21e\u00b7cm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969278949", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55032666400": {"Name": "Chislett R.", "AuthorID": "55032666400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}}}
