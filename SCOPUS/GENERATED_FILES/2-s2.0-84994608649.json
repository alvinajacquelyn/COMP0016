The bulk modulus, derived by fitting the equation of state to a second order Birch-Murnaghan equation-of-state, 157(5) GPa, is in excellent agreement with that deduced in a recent resonant ultrasound investigation. Experimental axial compressional moduli are in agreement with those calculated from the elastic stiffness coefficients derived by ab-initio calculation, although the experimental bulk modulus is significantly softer than that calculated. Following low temperature saturation for temperatures less than 40 K, the unit cell monotonically increases with a predicted high temperature limit in the volume expansivity of \u223c2.65 \u00d7 10\u22125 K\u22121. Axial linear thermal expansion coefficients are found to be in the order \u03b1b < \u03b1c < \u03b1a for all temperatures greater than 20 K with the b axis indicating a weak, low temperature negative expansion coefficient at low temperatures. The thermoelastic properties of SrZrO3 can be approximated by a two-term Debye model for the phonon density of states with Debye temperatures of 238(4) K and 713(6) K derived in a self-consistent manner by simultaneously fitting the isochoric heat capacity and the unit cell volume. Atomic displacement parameters have been fitted to a modified Debye model in which the zero-point term is an additional refinable variable and shows the cations and anions have well separated Debye temperatures, mirroring the need for two Debye-like distributions in the vibrational density of states. The temperature dependence of the crystal structure is presented in terms of the amplitudes of the seven symmetry-adapted basis vectors of the aristotype phase that are consistent with space group Pbnm, thus permitting a direct measure of the order parameter evolution in SrZrO3. The temperature variation of the in-phase tilt, which is lost at the phase transition at 973 K, is consistent with tricritical behaviour, in agreement with published results based on high temperature crystallographic data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crystal structure", "Neutron diffraction", "Perovskite", "SrZrO3", "Thermoelastic properties"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic displacement parameters", "Birch-Murnaghan equation of state", "Crystallographic properties", "Elastic stiffness coefficients", "Linear thermal expansion coefficients", "SrZrO", "Thermoelastic properties", "Vibrational density of state"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994608649", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus"}, "7102232119": {"Name": "Bull C.L.", "AuthorID": "7102232119", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus"}}}
