In terms of network theory they can be analysed in the so called primal space, where they display fractal properties and different allometries and where their size distribution follows the Zipf's law. Moreover, they can be analysed in the so called information space, where they display the typical properties of small world networks, such as fat tail distribution and high hierarchical and modular organization. In this paper we present results about the city boundary definition problem, that arise from universal properties emerging by applying percolation theory to the primal space. We discuss the results in respect to relevant allometries in the primal space.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["City boundaries", "Fractal properties", "Information spaces", "Modular organizations", "Percolation theory", "Transportation network", "Typical properties", "Universal properties"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928579785", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"15725393300": {"Name": "Masucci A.", "AuthorID": "15725393300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College of London"}, "24066273900": {"Name": "Arcaute E.", "AuthorID": "24066273900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College of London"}, "16319944300": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "16319944300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College of London"}, "7005713858": {"Name": "Batty M.", "AuthorID": "7005713858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College of London"}, "7801398143": {"Name": "Hatna E.", "AuthorID": "7801398143", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Modeling, Johns Hopkins University"}}}
