For well over a century, glial cells have been ascribed a mechanical role in the support of neural tissues, yet this idea has not been specifically tested in vivo. We report here that retinas devoid of MG rip apart, a defect known as retinoschisis. Using atomic force microscopy, we show that retinas without MG have decreased resistance to tensile stress and are softer than controls. Laser ablation of MG processes showed that these cells are under tension in the tissue. Thus, we propose that MG act like springs that hold the neural retina together, finally confirming an active mechanical role of glial cells in the CNS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ependymoglial Cells", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Retina", "Tensile Strength", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962421773", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57199302770": {"Name": "MacDonald R.", "AuthorID": "57199302770", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "15757923800": {"Name": "Randlett O.", "AuthorID": "15757923800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "56745740500": {"Name": "Oswald J.", "AuthorID": "56745740500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "6602281641": {"Name": "Franze K.", "AuthorID": "6602281641", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57203693369": {"Name": "Harris W.", "AuthorID": "57203693369", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "36560640300": {"Name": "Yoshimatsu T.", "AuthorID": "36560640300", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington"}}}
