All rights reserved.Sociology for Pharmacists: An Introduction is written specifically for professionals and students in pharmacy who are newcomers to the study of sociology. It introduces the key concepts of sociology and demonstrates their importance and application to pharmacy practice in the 21st century. It is unique in its role as the only text to introduce sociology specifically to pharmacists. Rather than an exhaustive treatment, the book provides a concise introduction to major perspectives in sociology-drawing on research evidence pertaining to health, illness, and professional practice-which will inform and enhance pharmacy practice. It offers an overview of sociology for rather than sociology of pharmacy, and will both inform practitioners and stimulate informed research into the social aspects of pharmacy practice. Key issues covered include: Key sociological concepts and perspectives Contemporary developments in pharmacy practice and pharmacy's professional status A review of research into the way people react to illness and look after their health How and why illness and disease are influenced by gender, ethnicity, and social class Health education and pharmacists' role in promoting health and ensuring appropriate medicine usage Social research methods Pharmacists are frequently encouraged to broaden their day-to-day practice. This timely book does just that by encouraging pharmacists to become more involved with advising clients, managing medicines, and supporting the promotion of health. In addition to providing an overview of these topics, the book also reviews the relevant research, and directs readers to further information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077622063", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7403523237": {"Name": "Taylor K.", "AuthorID": "7403523237", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "57204297367": {"Name": "Nettleton S.", "AuthorID": "57204297367", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Policy and Social Work, University of York"}, "16021785000": {"Name": "Harding G.", "AuthorID": "16021785000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary, University of London"}}}
