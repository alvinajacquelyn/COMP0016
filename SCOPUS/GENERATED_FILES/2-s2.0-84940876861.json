In fact, many studies on insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) show that pheromones can be highly dynamic traits that can express significant short-term plasticity across both abiotic and social environments. It is likely that this variability in CHC expression contributes to their important role in sexual signaling and mate choice. In this review, I discuss CHC plasticity and how this might influence sexual communication. I also highlight two important avenues for future research: examining plasticity in how individuals respond to CHC signals, and testing how sexual communication varies across abiotic and social environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CHCs", "Plasticity", "Sexual signals", "Social environment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940876861", "SubjectAreas": [["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"35848483900": {"Name": "Ingleby F.", "AuthorID": "35848483900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, John Maynard Smith Building"}}}
