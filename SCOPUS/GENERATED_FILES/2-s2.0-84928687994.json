The objective of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between vets (both neurology specialists and non-specialists) on the description and classification of videos depicting paroxysmal events, without knowing any results of diagnostic workup. An online questionnaire study was conducted, where participants watched 100 videos of dogs and cats exhibiting paroxysmal events and answered questions regarding: epileptic seizure presence (yes/no), seizure type, consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs. Agreement statistics (percentage agreement and kappa) calculated for each variable, with prevalence indices calculated to aid their interpretation. Results: Only a fair level of agreement (k = 0.40) was found for epileptic seizure presence. Overall agreement of seizure type was moderate (k = 0.44), with primary generalised seizures showing the highest level of agreement (k = 0.60), and focal the lowest (k =0.31). Fair agreement was found for consciousness status and the presence of autonomic signs (k = 0.21-0.40), but poor agreement for neurobehavioral signs (k = 0.16). Agreement for motor signs ranged from poor (k = \u2264 0.20) to moderate (k = 0.41-0.60). Differences between specialists and non-specialists were identified. Conclusions: The relatively low levels of agreement described here highlight the need for further discussions between neurology experts regarding classifying and describing epileptic seizures, and additional training of non-specialists to facilitate accurate diagnosis. There is a need for diagnostic tools (e.g. electroencephalogram) able to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agreement", "Canine", "Epilepsy", "Feline", "Kappa", "Paroxysmal event", "Seizure", "Video"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autonomic Nervous System", "Behavior, Animal", "Cat Diseases", "Cats", "Dog Diseases", "Dogs", "Movement", "Observer Variation", "Seizures", "Veterinarians", "Veterinary Medicine", "Video Recording"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928687994", "SubjectAreas": [["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"55200725900": {"Name": "Packer R.M.A.", "AuthorID": "55200725900", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College, Department of Clinical Science and Services"}, "56609956700": {"Name": "Hampel R.", "AuthorID": "56609956700", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College, Department of Clinical Science and Services"}, "56609640200": {"Name": "Hill M.", "AuthorID": "56609640200", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College, Department of Clinical Science and Services"}, "56609854800": {"Name": "Preston S.M.", "AuthorID": "56609854800", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College, Department of Clinical Science and Services"}, "25229222700": {"Name": "Taylor-Brown F.", "AuthorID": "25229222700", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College, Department of Clinical Science and Services"}, "7202998990": {"Name": "Volk H.A.", "AuthorID": "7202998990", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College, Department of Clinical Science and Services"}, "7003634339": {"Name": "Berendt M.", "AuthorID": "7003634339", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary Clinical and Animal Sciences"}, "7005889885": {"Name": "Bhatti S.", "AuthorID": "7005889885", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Department of Small Animal Medicine and Clinical Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine"}, "55861722100": {"Name": "Charalambous M.", "AuthorID": "55861722100", "AffiliationID": "60007776, 60021620", "AffiliationName": "Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine"}, "6603691893": {"Name": "Cizinauskas S.", "AuthorID": "6603691893", "AffiliationID": "102025729", "AffiliationName": "The Referral Animal Neurology Hospital Aisti"}, "57154430100": {"Name": "De Risio L.", "AuthorID": "57154430100", "AffiliationID": "60030557", "AffiliationName": "Animal Health Trust"}, "7005435399": {"Name": "Farquhar R.", "AuthorID": "7005435399", "AffiliationID": "118494927", "AffiliationName": "Fernside Veterinary Centre"}, "6701502795": {"Name": "Mandigers P.J.J.", "AuthorID": "6701502795", "AffiliationID": "60117221, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University, Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals"}, "8329774800": {"Name": "Pakozdy A.", "AuthorID": "8329774800", "AffiliationID": "60003417", "AffiliationName": "University of Veterinary Medicine, University Clinic for Small Animals, Clinical Department for Companion Animals and Horses"}, "6701849344": {"Name": "Rusbridge C.", "AuthorID": "6701849344", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172389", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey, School of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences"}, "8133291000": {"Name": "Stein V.M.", "AuthorID": "8133291000", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Department of Small Animal Medicine and Surgery"}, "56232907700": {"Name": "Tipold A.", "AuthorID": "56232907700", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Department of Small Animal Medicine and Surgery"}}}
