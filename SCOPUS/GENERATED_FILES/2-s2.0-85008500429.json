Two types of novel antimicrobial nanoparticles and poly(methylmethacrylate) polymer were used in this work. X-ray diffraction analysis of the nanoparticles revealed Ag, Cu and W are the main elements present in them. The concentration of the polymer solution and the nanoparticle concentration had a significant influence on the fibre diameter, pore size and morphology. Fibres with a diameter in the range of 6\u201320 \u03bcm were spun using 20 wt% polymer solutions containing 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 wt% nanoparticles under 0.3 MPa working pressure and a rotational speed of 36,000 rpm. Continuous, bead-free fibre morphologies were obtained for each case. The pore size in the fibres varied between 36 and 300 nm. Successful incorporation of the nanoparticles in polymer fibres was confirmed by energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The fibres were also gyrospun on to metallic discs to prepare filters which were tested for their antibacterial activity on a suspension of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nanoparticle loaded fibres showed higher antibacterial efficacy than pure poly(methylmethacrylate) fibres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial", "Fibres", "Filters", "Gyrospun", "Nanoparticle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-bacterial activity", "Antibacterial efficacy", "Antimicrobial", "Gyrospun", "Hybrid nanoparticle", "Nanoparticle concentrations", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Working pressures", "Anti-Infective Agents", "Humidity", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Nanoparticles", "Polymers", "Pressure", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Stainless Steel", "Temperature", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008500429", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57192871183": {"Name": "Eranka Illangakoon U.", "AuthorID": "57192871183", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "22935212900": {"Name": "Mahalingam S.", "AuthorID": "22935212900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205124254": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "57205124254", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56954553500": {"Name": "Cheong Y.K.", "AuthorID": "56954553500", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire"}, "23020031700": {"Name": "Ren G.G.", "AuthorID": "23020031700", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire"}, "40661103700": {"Name": "Cloutman-Green E.", "AuthorID": "40661103700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Virology, Infection Prevention Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192877547": {"Name": "Canales E.", "AuthorID": "57192877547", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "18435943500": {"Name": "Ciric L.", "AuthorID": "18435943500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
