Study Design: Data were analyzed from 12,836 women undergoing operation in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Outcomes measured were; 30-day postoperative mortality, composite and specific morbidities (cardiac, respiratory, central nervous system, renal, wound, sepsis, venous thrombosis, or major bleeding). Multivariate logistic regression models were performed using adjusted odds ratios (OR<inf>adj</inf>) to assess the independent effects of preoperative anaemia (hematocrit <36.0%) on outcomes, effect estimates were performed before and after adjustment for perioperative transfusion requirement. Results: The prevalence of preoperative anaemia was 23.9% (95%CI: 23.2-24.7). Adjusted for confounders by multivariate logistic regression; preoperative anaemia was independently and significantly associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (OR: 2.40, 95%CI: 1.06-5.44) and composite morbidity (OR: 1.80, 95%CI: 1.45-2.24). This was reflected by significantly higher adjusted odds of almost all specific morbidities including; respiratory, central nervous system, renal, wound, sepsis, and venous thrombosis. Blood Transfusion increased the effect of preoperative anaemia on outcomes (61% of the effect on mortality and 16% of the composite morbidity). Conclusions: Preoperative anaemia is associated with adverse post-operative outcomes in women undergoing gynecological surgery. This risk associated with preoperative anaemia did not appear to be corrected by use of perioperative transfusion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anemia", "Blood Transfusion", "Female", "Gynecologic Surgical Procedures", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Preoperative Period", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940069464", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56427569500": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "56427569500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "16301178800": {"Name": "Gurusamy K.S.", "AuthorID": "16301178800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "24335608600": {"Name": "Musallam K.M.", "AuthorID": "24335608600", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}, "25645419200": {"Name": "Nassif J.", "AuthorID": "25645419200", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}, "6507574366": {"Name": "Ghazeeri G.", "AuthorID": "6507574366", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}, "7006802042": {"Name": "Seoud M.", "AuthorID": "7006802042", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}, "15127113200": {"Name": "Jamali F.R.", "AuthorID": "15127113200", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}}}
