Our aim is to optimize the EE of the system whilst satisfying the constraints on maximum transmit power, minimum data rate and minimum harvested energy per-terminal. The considered EE optimization problem is formulated and then transformed according to the duality of broadcast channels (BC) and multiple access channels (MAC). The corresponding non-linear and non-convex optimization problem, involving joint optimization of power allocation and time switching factor, is difficult to solve directly. In order to tackle this problem, we develop a dual-layer algorithm where a convex programming-based Dinkelbach's method is proposed to optimize the power allocation in the inner-layer and an efficient search method is then applied to optimize the TS factor in the outer-layer. Numerical results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that significant performance gain over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme in terms of EE can be achieved by the proposed algorithm in a SWIPT-enabled NOMA system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Broadcast channels", "Dinkelbach's methods", "Energy-efficient resource allocation", "Information and power transfers", "Joint optimization", "Multiple access channels", "Nonconvex optimization", "Optimization problems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063527351", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56331385900": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "56331385900", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology"}, "57205715420": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "57205715420", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology"}, "7003869058": {"Name": "So D.", "AuthorID": "7003869058", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "23007808700": {"Name": "Alsusa E.", "AuthorID": "23007808700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "45562028800": {"Name": "Zhao N.", "AuthorID": "45562028800", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}}}
