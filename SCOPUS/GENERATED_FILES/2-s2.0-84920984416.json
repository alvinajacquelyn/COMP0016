The ability to detect deviations from norms and to adapt to norms in a changing environment is therefore important to individuals\u2019 normal social functioning. Previous neuroimaging studies have highlighted the involvement of the insular and ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) cortices in representing norms. However, the necessity and dissociability of their involvement remain unclear. Using model-based computational modeling and neuropsychological lesion approaches,weexamined the contributions of the insula andvmPFCtonormadaptation in sevenhumanpatients with focal insula lesions and six patients with focal vmPFC lesions, in comparison with forty neurologically intact controls and six brain-damaged controls. There were three computational signals of interest as participants played a fairness game (ultimatum game): sensitivity to the fairness of offers, sensitivity to deviations from expected norms, and the speed at which people adapt to norms. Significant group differences were assessed using bootstrapping methods. Patients with insula lesions displayed abnormally low adaptation speed to norms, yet detected norm violations with greater sensitivity than controls. Patients with vmPFC lesions did not have such abnormalities, but displayed reduced sensitivity to fairness and were more likely to accept the most unfair offers. These findings provide compelling computational and lesion evidence supporting the necessary, yet dissociable roles of the insula and vmPFC in norm adaptation in humans: the insula is critical for learning to adapt when reality deviates from norm expectations, and that the vmPFC is important for valuation of fairness during social exchange.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain lesion", "Computational modeling", "Decision-making", "Insular cortex", "Social norms", "Ventromedial prefrontal cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Aged", "Brain Damage, Chronic", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Organ Specificity", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Social Norms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920984416", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"16232881500": {"Name": "Gu X.", "AuthorID": "16232881500", "AffiliationID": "60138707", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}, "57215763733": {"Name": "Hula X.", "AuthorID": "57215763733", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7004572764": {"Name": "Montague P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004572764", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}, "6506984553": {"Name": "Lohrenz T.M.", "AuthorID": "6506984553", "AffiliationID": "60138707", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}, "55361373000": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "55361373000", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "56401943500": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56401943500", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "56480920400": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "56480920400", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "55464027300": {"Name": "Gao Z.", "AuthorID": "55464027300", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "57206471338": {"Name": "Knight R.T.", "AuthorID": "57206471338", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of California"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
