Aging Cell published by the Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Mutations in cerebral cavernous malformation 3 gene are known to result in development of vascular malformations and have recently been proposed to also give rise to meningiomas. We report in this study that lack of CCM3 unexpectedly impairs the senescence response of cells, and this is related to the inability of CCM3-deficient cells to induce the C/EBP\u03b2 transcription factor and implement the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Induction of C/EBP\u03b2 and cytokines is also impaired in the absence of CCM3 in response to cytokines in nonsenescent cells, pointing to it being a primary defect and not secondary to impaired senescence. CCM3-deficient cells also have a defect in autophagy at late passages of culture, and this defect is also not dependent on impaired senescence, as it is evident in immortal cells after nutrient starvation. Further, these two defects may be related, as enforcing autophagy in CCM3-deficient late passage cells increases C/EBP\u03b2 cytokine expression. These results broaden our knowledge on the mechanisms by which CCM3 deficiency results in disease and open new avenues of research into both CCM3 and senescence biology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autophagy", "CEBPb", "PDCD10", "SASP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Autophagy", "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta", "Cell Aging", "Cell Line", "Cytokines", "Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924253264", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57192005232": {"Name": "Guerrero A.", "AuthorID": "57192005232", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Cell Proliferation Group, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "55178180700": {"Name": "Iglesias C.", "AuthorID": "55178180700", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, CIMUS, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria IDIS, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "55877545000": {"Name": "Floridia E.", "AuthorID": "55877545000", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, CIMUS, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria IDIS, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "6603836066": {"Name": "Pombo C.", "AuthorID": "6603836066", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, CIMUS, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria IDIS, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "6602825552": {"Name": "Zalvide J.", "AuthorID": "6602825552", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, CIMUS, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria IDIS, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "55933404300": {"Name": "Raguz S.", "AuthorID": "55933404300", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Cell Biology, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College"}, "7201625551": {"Name": "Gil J.", "AuthorID": "7201625551", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Cell Proliferation Group, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}}}
