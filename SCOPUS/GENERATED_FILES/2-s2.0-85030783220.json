The method makes use of a custom-designed laser ultrasound source which generates a large diameter (>1 cm) broadband monopolar plane wave with a continuous frequency content extending from \u2264330 kHz to \u224880 MHz. The plane wave is highly uniform in amplitude (\u00b15% over >8 mm) and phase (equivalent to <\u03bb/7 at 80 MHz over \u226511 mm). To measure directivity, the source is rotated around the receiver under test in a compact centimeter-scale setup. To demonstrate the method, it was used to measure the directivity of two broadband small aperture Fabry-Perot ultrasound sensors over an angular range of \u00b150\u00b0 at frequencies up to 80 MHz. Measurements were found to be highly repeatable with an estimated typical repeatability <4% in the range of 0.5-25 MHz. Due to the broad bandwidth, large size, and adjustable nature of the source, the method is widely applicable and could aid the characterization of receivers used in medical ultrasound, ultrasonic nondestructive testing. and ultrasound metrology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Broadband", "directional sensitivity", "directivity", "Fabry-Perot (FP)", "frequency response", "laser ultrasound (LUS)", "ultrasonic variables measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Broadband", "Broadband Communication", "Directional sensitivity", "Directivity", "Fabry-Perot", "Frequency measurements", "Laser ultrasound"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030783220", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"44061273200": {"Name": "Guggenheim J.", "AuthorID": "44061273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
