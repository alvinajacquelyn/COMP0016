Facilitating them in engineering education would benefit students by providing them a structure to think creatively and meaningfully in their education and future profession. At the same time, it would bring the much-needed awareness about design\u2019s deeper notion of being a systematic and creative problem solving approach among engineering students. This would increase the value of design in the community of engineers. A study to evaluate the need and relevance of design thinking and creative problem solving from the perspective of engineering students was conducted in the name of a \u2018pop-up class\u2019 for one week, without any credit incentives at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD). 30 3rd year Bachelor students from various technical fields (chemical, mechanical, civil, production engineering, textile, electrical engineering and engineering physics) participated in the study. They were introduced to the topic via a mix of theoretical lectures, case discussions and practical workshops. The workshop had been evaluated by the students with a questionnaire at the end of the study and subsequently analyzed. All respondents answered that Design Thinking and Creative Problem Solving are relevant for their education. 90% responded positively to the suggestion of introducing such a course in their education stating that it\u2019s important for engineers to know how to solve real world problems in a meaningful way, and by this to drive innovation. Although most students agreed that it should become a compulsory course, they feared for its value, when it would become grade oriented like other courses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Creative problem solving", "Design thinking", "Undergraduate engineering education"], "IndexKeywords": ["Creative problem-solving", "Design thinking", "Educational Institutes", "Engineering physics", "Indian institute of technologies", "Innovation Culture", "Real-world problem", "Undergraduate engineering educations"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040511824", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56644527100": {"Name": "Bhatnagar T.", "AuthorID": "56644527100", "AffiliationID": "60118051, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "6602889852": {"Name": "Badke-Schaub P.", "AuthorID": "6602889852", "AffiliationID": "60118051, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}}}
