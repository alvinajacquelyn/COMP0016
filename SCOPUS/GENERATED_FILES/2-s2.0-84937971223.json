BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.Objective To explore whether the increased risk of preterm birth following treatment for cervical disease is limited to the first birth following colposcopy. Design Nested case-control study. Setting Twelve NHS hospitals in England. Population All nonmultiple births from women selected as cases or controls from a cohort of women with both colposcopy and a hospital birth. Cases had a preterm (20-36 weeks of gestation) birth. Controls had a term birth (38-42 weeks) and no preterm. Methods Obstetric, colposcopy and pathology details were obtained. Main outcome measures Adjusted odds ratio of preterm birth in first and second or subsequent births following treatment for cervical disease. Results A total of 2798 births (1021 preterm) from 2001 women were included in the analysis. The risk of preterm birth increased with increasing depth of treatment among first births post treatment [trend per category increase in depth, categories <10 mm, 10-14 mm, 15-19 mm, \u226520 mm: odds ratio (OR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.12-1.36, P < 0.001] and among second and subsequent births post treatment (trend OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.56, P < 0.001). No trend was observed among births before colposcopy (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83-1.16, P = 0.855). The absolute risk of a preterm birth following deep treatments (\u226515 mm) was 6.5% among births before colposcopy, 18.9% among first births and 17.2% among second and subsequent births post treatment. Risk of preterm birth (once depth was accounted for) did not differ when comparing first births post colposcopy with second and subsequent births post colposcopy (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89-1.49). Conclusions The increased risk of preterm birth following treatment for cervical disease is not restricted to the first birth post colposcopy; it remains for second and subsequent births. These results suggest that once a woman has a deep treatment she remains at higher risk of a preterm birth throughout her reproductive life. Tweetable abstract Risk of preterm birth following large treatments for cervical disease remains for second and subsequent births.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia", "conisation", "large loop excision of the transformation zone", "preterm delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia", "Colposcopy", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Odds Ratio", "Pregnancy", "Premature Birth", "Risk Factors", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937971223", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"12239528800": {"Name": "Casta\u00f1on A.", "AuthorID": "12239528800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Bart's and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55480407400": {"Name": "Landy R.", "AuthorID": "55480407400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Bart's and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006366205": {"Name": "Sasieni P.", "AuthorID": "7006366205", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine"}, "56745864600": {"Name": "Brocklehurst P.", "AuthorID": "56745864600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health UCL"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health UCL"}, "57209051063": {"Name": "Evans H.", "AuthorID": "57209051063", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecology, Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust"}, "36132607200": {"Name": "Walker P.", "AuthorID": "36132607200", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecology, Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust"}, "7404363652": {"Name": "Singh N.", "AuthorID": "7404363652", "AffiliationID": "115149077", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cellular Pathology, Barts Health"}, "56231743100": {"Name": "Patnick J.", "AuthorID": "56231743100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, NHS Cancer Screening Programmes"}}}
