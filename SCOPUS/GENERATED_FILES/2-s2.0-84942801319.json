Published by Elsevier Inc.The development of co-electrospun (co-ES) hollow microfibrous assemblies of an appreciable thickness is critical for many practical applications, including filtration membranes and tissue-mimicking scaffolds. In this study, thick uniaxially aligned hollow microfibrous assemblies forming fiber bundles and strips were prepared by co-ES of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) as shell and core materials, respectively. Hollow microfiber bundles were deposited on a fixed rotating disc, which resulted in non-controllable cross-sectional shapes on a macroscopic scale. In comparison, fiber strips were produced with tuneable thickness and width by additionally employing an x-y translation stage in co-ES. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of cross-sections of fiber assemblies were analyzed to investigate the effects of production time (from 0.5 h to 12 h), core flow rate (from 0.8 mL/h to 2.0 mL/h) and/or translation speed (from 0.2 mm/s to 5 mm/s) on the pores and porosity. We observed significant changes in pore size and shape with core flow rate but the influence of production time varied; five strips produced under the same conditions had reasonably good size and porosity reproducibility; pore sizes didn't vary significantly from strip bottom to surface, although the porosity gradually decreased and then returned to the initial level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-electrospinning", "Cross-section", "Hollow microfibers", "Production time", "SEM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Co-electrospinning", "Cross-section", "Cross-sectional shape", "Filtration membranes", "Microfibers", "Polyethylene oxide (PEO)", "Production time", "Scanning electron microscopy image"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942801319", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"24333643200": {"Name": "Zhou F.L.", "AuthorID": "24333643200", "AffiliationID": "60172349", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre in Cambridge and Manchester"}, "24766914700": {"Name": "Parker G.J.M.", "AuthorID": "24766914700", "AffiliationID": "60172349", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre in Cambridge and Manchester"}, "55189010100": {"Name": "Hubbard Cristinacce P.L.", "AuthorID": "55189010100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7005544400": {"Name": "Eichhorn S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005544400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
