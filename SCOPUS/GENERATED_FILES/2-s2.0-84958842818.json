We looked at the association between expectations and stereotyping of loneliness in old age and actual self-reported loneliness status 8 years later in English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Method: Data from 4465 ELSA core members aged over 50 who responded to Waves 2 (2004) did not report loneliness in Wave 2, and responded to loneliness questions at least once between Waves 3 and 6 (2006-2012) were used in multivariable repeated measures logit regression analysis to estimate relationship between perceived stereotypes and expectation of loneliness in older age and actual loneliness reported within 8 years of follow-up. Results: Twenty-four per cent of respondents from the analytical sample agreed at Wave 2 that old age is time of loneliness and 33% expected to be lonely in old age. Loneliness was reported by 11.5% of respondents at Waves 3-6. Both stereotypes and expectation were significantly associated with later reported loneliness (OR 2.65 (95% CI 2.05-3.42) for stereotypes and 2.98 (95% CI 2.33-3.75) for expectations in age-sex adjusted analysis). Both variables significantly predicted future loneliness even when socio-demographic circumstances were taken into account and both variables were mutually adjusted although the effect was reduced (OR's 1.53 (95% CI 1.16-2.01) for stereotypes and 2.38 (95% CI 1.84-3.07) for expectations). Conclusions: Stereotypes and expectations related to loneliness in the old age were significantly associated with reported loneliness 8 years later. Interventions aimed at changing age-related stereotypes in population may have more impact on reducing loneliness than individually based services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["age-stereotypes", "ELSA", "expectation", "loneliness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Female", "Humans", "Life Change Events", "Loneliness", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Marital Status", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Regression Analysis", "Social Support", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Stereotyping"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958842818", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6602912581": {"Name": "Pikhartova J.", "AuthorID": "6602912581", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60166873", "AffiliationName": "College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "21647459300": {"Name": "Victor C.", "AuthorID": "21647459300", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60166873", "AffiliationName": "College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "7102305834": {"Name": "Bowling A.", "AuthorID": "7102305834", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
