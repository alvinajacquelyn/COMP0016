It is widely assumed that, since they are explicitly instructed to do, participants use mentalizing in this communicative task; they represent what the director can see, and therefore the DT provides important information about how and when mentalizing is used in adult life. We tested this view against a \u201csubmentalizing\u201d hypothesis suggesting that DT performance depends on object-centered spatial coding, without mentalizing. As predicted by the submentalizing account, we found that DT performance was unchanged when the director was replaced by an inanimate object, a camera, and that participants with autism spectrum disorders were unimpaired, relative to matched control participants, in both the director and camera conditions. In combination with recent critical analyses of \u201cimplicit mentalizing,\u201d these findings support the view that adults use mentalizing sparingly in psychological experiments and in everyday life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Director task", "Mentalizing", "Object-centered spatial coding", "Perspective-taking", "Submentalizing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Space Perception", "Theory of Mind", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928955136", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"54789267500": {"Name": "Santiesteban I.", "AuthorID": "54789267500", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55683296400": {"Name": "Shah P.", "AuthorID": "55683296400", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "17342102400": {"Name": "Bird G.", "AuthorID": "17342102400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56623762200": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "56623762200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7007120930": {"Name": "Heyes C.", "AuthorID": "7007120930", "AffiliationID": "60099141, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "All Souls College, University of Oxford"}}}
