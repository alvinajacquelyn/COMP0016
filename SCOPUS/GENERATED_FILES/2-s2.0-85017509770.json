Six male boxers were assessed while performing standardized prefight warm-up routines. Core and skin temperature measurements (Tcore and Tskin), heart rate, and upper- and lowerbody power output (PO) were assessed before and after warmup, during a 25-minutes GAP and after 3 3 2 minutes rounds of sparring. Reflected temperature (Tc) was also determined using high-resolution thermal images at fixed time-points to explore avenues for heat loss. Despite individual differences in warmup duration (range 7.4-18.5 minutes), increases in Tcore and Tskin occurred (p # 0.05). Corresponding increases (4.8%; p # 0.05) in countermovement jump (CMJ) height and upwardrightward shifts in upper-body force-velocity and power-velocity curves were observed. Athletes remained inactive during the 25- minutes GAP with a gradual and significant increase in Tc occurring by the end of GAP suggesting the likelihood of heat loss. Decreases in CMJ height and upper-body PO were observed after 15 minutes and 25 minutes GAP (p # 0.05). By the end of GAP period, all performance variables had returned to pre- warm-up values. Results suggest routine warm-ups undertaken by elite boxers have acute effects on power-generating capacity. Gradual decreases in performance variables are evident with inactivity and seem related to alterations in body temperature. Considering the constraints of major competitions and time spent in air conditioned holding areas before fights, practitioners should be aware of the potential of nullifying the warm-up effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Athlete preparation", "Body temperature", "Force", "Velocity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Athletes", "Athletic Performance", "Body Temperature", "Boxing", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Warm-Up Exercise"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017509770", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"34871750100": {"Name": "Cunniffe B.", "AuthorID": "34871750100", "AffiliationID": "60107252", "AffiliationName": "English Institute of Sport"}, "22941686000": {"Name": "Loosemore M.", "AuthorID": "22941686000", "AffiliationID": "120311213", "AffiliationName": "British Amateur Boxing Association"}, "57193915562": {"Name": "Ellison M.", "AuthorID": "57193915562", "AffiliationID": "120311213", "AffiliationName": "British Amateur Boxing Association"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}}}
