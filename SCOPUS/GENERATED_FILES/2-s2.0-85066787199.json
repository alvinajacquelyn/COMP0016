The belt is designed to measure the torso shape of a neonate and provide real-time boundary information to assist the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system to produce high quality lung respiration images. The system is fully integrated on a flexible printed circuit board which is encapsulated in a silicon wearable cover. During the live demonstration, while EIT images are reconstructed, the boundary shape can be changed to improve the image.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary information", "Boundary shapes", "Electrical impe dance tomography (EIT)", "Flexible printed circuit boards", "Fully integrated", "High quality", "Respiration monitoring", "Shape detection"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066787199", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56673175100": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "56673175100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "15922999900": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "15922999900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "8875838100": {"Name": "Bardill A.", "AuthorID": "8875838100", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University"}, "57190879088": {"Name": "De Gelidi S.", "AuthorID": "57190879088", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University"}, "6603764288": {"Name": "Bayford R.", "AuthorID": "6603764288", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University"}}}
