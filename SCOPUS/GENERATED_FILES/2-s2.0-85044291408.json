Objective: To determine whether AF ablation is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and stroke compared with medical therapy alone. Methods: Literature search looking for both randomized and observational studies comparing AF catheter ablation vs. medical management. Data pooled using random-effects. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) used as a measure of treatment effect. The primary and secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and occurrence of cerebrovascular events during follow-up, respectively. Results: Thirty studies were eligible for inclusion, comprising 78,966 patients (25,129 receiving AF ablation and 53,837 on medical treatment) and 233,990 patient-years of follow-up. The pooled data of studies revealed that ablation was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality: 5.7% vs. 17.9%; RR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.62, p < 0.001. In a sensitivity analysis by study design, a survival benefit of AF ablation was seen in randomized studies, with no heterogeneity (mortality risk 4.2% vs. 8.9%; RR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.39\u20130.79, p = 0.001, I2 = 0%), and also in observational studies, but with marked heterogeneity (6.1% vs. 18.3%; RR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.26\u20130.59, p < 0.001, I2 = 95%). The mortality benefit in randomized studies was mainly driven by trials performed in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure. The pooled risk of a cerebrovascular event was lower in patients receiving AF ablation (2.3% vs. 5.5%; RR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.46\u20130.70, p < 0.001, I2 = 62%), but no difference was seen in randomized trials (2.2% vs. 2.1%; RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.46\u20131.94, p = 0.87, I2 = 0%). Conclusions: Ablation of atrial fibrillation associates with a survival benefit compared with medical treatment alone, although evidence is restricted to the setting of heart failure and LV systolic dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ablation", "Atrial fibrillation", "Meta-analysis", "Mortality", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Catheter Ablation", "Humans", "Mortality", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Stroke", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044291408", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"37025430000": {"Name": "Barra S.", "AuthorID": "37025430000", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36674661200": {"Name": "Baran J.", "AuthorID": "36674661200", "AffiliationID": "60085376, 60069009", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Electrophysiology, Department of Cardiology, Grochowski Hospital, Postgraduate Medical School"}, "6601988933": {"Name": "Fynn S.", "AuthorID": "6601988933", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23102885200": {"Name": "Heck P.", "AuthorID": "23102885200", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102284681": {"Name": "Grace A.", "AuthorID": "7102284681", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35518549600": {"Name": "Agarwal S.", "AuthorID": "35518549600", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57042348100": {"Name": "Narayanan K.", "AuthorID": "57042348100", "AffiliationID": "120096580", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, MaxCure Hospitals"}, "12143483700": {"Name": "Marijon E.", "AuthorID": "12143483700", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University"}, "6701478201": {"Name": "Boveda S.", "AuthorID": "6701478201", "AffiliationID": "60007745", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Clinique Pasteur"}, "7004464272": {"Name": "Primo J.", "AuthorID": "7004464272", "AffiliationID": "120436300", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, V.
