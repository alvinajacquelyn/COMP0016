A microwave current was injected into a patterned CoFeB/Pt bi-layer grown on a glass substrate, simultaneously exerting spin-transfer torques through the spin-Hall effect and also causing Joule heating enabling the control of the device temperature. We measured the device temperature by using the device itself as a local temperature sensor. A clear reduction of CoFeB magnetisation was observed as the device temperature was increased allowing us to estimate the Curie temperature of our CoFeB film to be 920 K. The spin-Hall angle of Pt was quantified as (1.72 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10\u22122 at 300 K and was slightly increased to (1.75 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u22122 at 410 K. This simple method can be widely used for quantifying the spin-Hall angle of a large variety of materials at high temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High-temperature-measurement", "Magnetisation dynamics", "Spin-Hall-angle", "Spin-transfer-torque"], "IndexKeywords": ["Device temperature", "Glass substrates", "High temperature", "High temperature measurement", "On currents", "SIMPLE method", "Spin transfer torque", "Spin-Hall-angle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065476311", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57208665962": {"Name": "Phu P.", "AuthorID": "57208665962", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55806763000": {"Name": "Yamanoi K.", "AuthorID": "55806763000", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kyushu University"}, "22954040500": {"Name": "Rogdakis K.", "AuthorID": "22954040500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "24071155200": {"Name": "Kurebayashi H.", "AuthorID": "24071155200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57203520374": {"Name": "Ohnishi K.", "AuthorID": "57203520374", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Quantum Nano-Spin Sciences, Kyushu University"}, "55994426900": {"Name": "Kimura T.", "AuthorID": "55994426900", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Quantum Nano-Spin Sciences, Kyushu University"}, "35310510500": {"Name": "Hyodo J.", "AuthorID": "35310510500", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "INAMORI Frontier Research Center, Kyushu University"}, "16044223000": {"Name": "Yamazaki Y.", "AuthorID": "16044223000", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyushu University"}}}
