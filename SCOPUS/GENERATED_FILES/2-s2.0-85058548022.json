We hypothesised that loss of cardioprotective vagal tone [defined by impaired heart rate recovery \u226412 beats min \u22121 (HRR \u226412) 1 min after cessation of preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing] was associated with perioperative myocardial injury. Methods: We conducted a pre-defined, secondary analysis of a multi-centre prospective cohort study of preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Participants were aged \u226540 yr undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The exposure was impaired HRR (HRR\u226412). The primary outcome was postoperative myocardial injury, defined by serum troponin concentration within 72 h after surgery. The analysis accounted for established markers of cardiac risk [Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP)]. Results: A total of 1326 participants were included [mean age (standard deviation), 64 (10) yr], of whom 816 (61.5%) were male. HRR\u226412 occurred in 548 patients (41.3%). Myocardial injury was more frequent amongst patients with HRR\u226412 [85/548 (15.5%) vs HRR>12: 83/778 (10.7%); odds ratio (OR), 1.50 (1.08\u20132.08); P=0.016, adjusted for RCRI). HRR declined progressively in patients with increasing numbers of RCRI factors. Patients with \u22653 RCRI factors were more likely to have HRR\u226412 [26/36 (72.2%) vs 0 factors: 167/419 (39.9%); OR, 3.92 (1.84\u20138.34); P<0.001]. NT pro-BNP greater than a standard prognostic threshold (>300 pg ml \u22121 ) was more frequent in patients with HRR\u226412 [96/529 (18.1%) vs HRR>12 59/745 (7.9%); OR, 2.58 (1.82\u20133.64); P<0.001]. Conclusions: Impaired HRR is associated with an increased risk of perioperative cardiac injury. These data suggest a mechanistic role for cardiac vagal dysfunction in promoting perioperative myocardial injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B-type natriuretic peptide", "cardiopulmonary exercise testing", "heart rate", "myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery", "surgery", "troponin", "vagal function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Exercise Test", "Exercise Tolerance", "Female", "Heart", "Heart Injuries", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Peptide Fragments", "Postoperative Complications", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Preoperative Care", "Prospective Studies", "Surgical Procedures, Operative", "Treatment Outcome", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058548022", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"56684603900": {"Name": "Abbott T.E.F.", "AuthorID": "56684603900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "7005083648": {"Name": "Pearse R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005083648", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.L.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7003675957": {"Name": "Cuthbertson B.H.", "AuthorID": "7003675957", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "6603340036": {"Name": "Wijeysundera D.N.", "AuthorID": "6603340036", "AffiliationID": "60023022", "AffiliationName": "Toronto General Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
