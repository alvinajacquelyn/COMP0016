The evolution of superorganismality in insects is one such major transition, and is characterised by an extreme division of reproductive labour between ancestrally autonomous units, in the form of queen and worker castes. Here, we discuss the nature of plasticity in the emergence of castes across the major transition to superorganismality in insects. We identify key changes in plasticity which act at different levels of selection: a loss of reproductivity plasticity at the individual level is matched by a gain in plasticity at the colony level. Taking multi-level selection into consideration has important implications for formulating testable hypotheses regarding the nature of plasticity in a major transition from a lower to a higher level of biological complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Insecta", "Reproduction", "Selection, Genetic", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064377491", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"57208303845": {"Name": "Taylor B.A.", "AuthorID": "57208303845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College London"}, "7005759495": {"Name": "Sumner S.", "AuthorID": "7005759495", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College London"}, "7202271993": {"Name": "Reuter M.", "AuthorID": "7202271993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College London"}}}
