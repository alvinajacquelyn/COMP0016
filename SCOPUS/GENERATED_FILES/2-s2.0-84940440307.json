Additionally, the relative contributions of the questionnaire's 4 subscales were assessed. Two samples of Canadian university students completed the TEIQue-SF, along with measures of the Big Five, coping strategies (Sample 1 only), and emotion-laden criteria. The TEIQue-SF showed consistent incremental effects beyond the Big Five or the Big Five and coping strategies, predicting all 7 criteria examined across the 2 samples. Furthermore, 2 of the 4 TEIQue-SF subscales accounted for the measure's incremental validity. Although the findings provide good support for the validity and utility of the TEIQue-SF, directions for further research are emphasized. \u00a9 2015", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Emotional Intelligence", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Personality", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940440307", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"54913642400": {"Name": "Siegling A.", "AuthorID": "54913642400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}, "54913126200": {"Name": "Vesely A.", "AuthorID": "54913126200", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario"}, "7004876348": {"Name": "Saklofske D.", "AuthorID": "7004876348", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario"}}}
