However, in the acute phase of an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has been demonstrated to overestimate MI size and TEI. We aimed to identify the optimal cut-off of TEI by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for defining viability during the acute phase of an MI, using \u226450% TEI at follow-up as the reference standard. 40 STEMI patients reperfused by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) underwent a CMR at 4 \u00b1 2 days and 5 \u00b1 2 months. The large majority of segments with 1-25%TEI and 26-50%TEI that were viable acutely were also viable at follow-up (59/59, 100% and 75/82, 96% viable respectively). 56/84(67%) segments with 51-75%TEI but only 4/63(6%) segments with 76-100%TEI were reclassified as viable at follow-up. TEI on the acute CMR scan had an area-under-The-curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval of 0.82 to 0.91) and \u226475%TEI had a sensitivity of 98% but a specificity of 66% to predict viability at follow-up. Therefore, the optimal cut-off by CMR during the acute phase of an MI to predict viability was \u226475% TEI and this would have important implications for patients undergoing viability testing prior to revascularization during the acute phase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coronary Artery Bypass", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033468078", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloid Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "24077375900": {"Name": "Sirker A.", "AuthorID": "24077375900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "34970790200": {"Name": "Bhuva A.N.", "AuthorID": "34970790200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57190741709": {"Name": "Nordin S.", "AuthorID": "57190741709", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "26534328000": {"Name": "Herrey A.S.", "AuthorID": "26534328000", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55589453200": {"Name": "Knight D.S.", "AuthorID": "55589453200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloid Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
