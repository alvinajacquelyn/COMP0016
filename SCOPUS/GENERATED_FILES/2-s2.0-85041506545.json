By characterizing SH intra-population variation, we test current models to explain the Neanderthal origins. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional reconstructions of dentine surfaces of lower first and second molars were produced by micro-computed tomography. Landmarks and sliding semilandmarks were subjected to generalized Procrustes analysis and principal components analysis. Results: SH is often similar in shape to Neanderthals, and both groups are generally discernible from Homo sapiens. For example, the crown height of SH and Neanderthals is lower than for modern humans. Differences in the presence of a mid-trigonid crest are also observed, with contemporary Homo sapiens usually lacking this feature. Although SH and Neanderthals show strong affinities, they can be discriminated based on certain traits. SH individuals are characterized by a lower intra-population variability, and show a derived dental reduction in lower second molars compared to Neanderthals. SH also differs in morphological features from specimens that are often classified as Homo heidelbergensis, such as a lower crown height and less pronounced mid-trigonid crest in the Arago fossils. Discussion: Our results are compatible with the idea that multiple evolutionary lineages or populations coexisted in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, with the SH paradigm phylogenetically closer to Homo neanderthalensis. Further research could support the possibility of SH as a separate taxon. Alternatively, SH could be a subspecies of Neanderthals, with the variability of this clade being remarkably higher than previously thought.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dental anthropology", "European Pleistocene", "hominin taxonomy", "Neanderthal origins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anthropology, Physical", "Biological Evolution", "Dentin", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Molar", "Neanderthals", "Odontometry", "Principal Component Analysis", "Spain", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041506545", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"57200525168": {"Name": "Hanegraef H.", "AuthorID": "57200525168", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London (UCL)"}, "6505967345": {"Name": "Martin\u00f3n-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "6505967345", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH)"}, "56079325900": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez de Pinillos M.", "AuthorID": "56079325900", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH)"}, "7003670066": {"Name": "Berm\u00fadez de Castro J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003670066", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH)"}, "51763866100": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn-Franc\u00e9s L.", "AuthorID": "51763866100", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60008134, 60106840", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, CNRS, MCC, PACEA"}, "56004833400": {"Name": "Vialet A.", "AuthorID": "56004833400", "AffiliationID": "60028311", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Pr\u00e9histoire du Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Institut de Pal\u00e9ontologie Humaine"}, "6506247114": {"Name": "Arsuaga J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506247114", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centro Mixto UCM-ISCIII de Evoluci\u00f3n y Comportamiento Humanos"}}}
