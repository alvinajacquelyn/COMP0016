We developed the theory-driven \u00e2 Compassion Intervention' to enhance end-of-life care in advanced dementia. Objectives To (1) understand how the Intervention operated in nursing homes in different health economies; (2) collect preliminary outcome data and costs of an interdisciplinary care leader (ICL) to facilitate the Intervention; (3) check the Intervention caused no harm. Design A naturalistic feasibility study of Intervention implementation for 6 months. Settings Two nursing homes in northern London, UK. Participants Thirty residents with advanced dementia were assessed of whom nine were recruited for data collection; four of these residents' family members were interviewed. Twenty-eight nursing home and external healthcare professionals participated in interviews at 7 (n=19), 11 (n=19) and 15 months (n=10). Intervention An ICL led two core Intervention components: (1) integrated, interdisciplinary assessment and care; (2) education and support for paid and family carers. Data collected Process and outcome data were collected. Symptoms were recorded monthly for recruited residents. Semistructured interviews were conducted at 7, 11 and 15 months with nursing home staff and external healthcare professionals and at 7 months with family carers. ICL hours were costed using Department of Health and Health Education England tariffs. Results Contextual differences were identified between sites: Nursing home 2 had lower involvement with external healthcare services. Core components were implemented at both sites but multidisciplinary meetings were only established in nursing home 1. The Intervention prompted improvements in advance care planning, pain management and person-centred care; we observed no harm. Six-month ICL costs were \u00a318 255. Conclusions Implementation was feasible to differing degrees across sites, dependent on context. Our data inform future testing to identify the Intervention's effectiveness in improving end-of-life care in advanced dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult palliative care", "Change management", "Dementia", "MEDICAL EDUCATION & TRAINING"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Attitude to Health", "Caregivers", "Dementia", "Empathy", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Homes for the Aged", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Nursing Homes", "Patient Satisfaction", "Terminal Care", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023742357", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7403339089": {"Name": "Moore K.", "AuthorID": "7403339089", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6602211631": {"Name": "Candy B.", "AuthorID": "6602211631", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57211183430": {"Name": "Davis S.", "AuthorID": "57211183430", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56226371200": {"Name": "Gola A.", "AuthorID": "56226371200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55703138200": {"Name": "Harrington J.", "AuthorID": "55703138200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55588362000": {"Name": "Kupeli N.", "AuthorID": "55588362000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55576291300": {"Name": "Vickerstaff V.", "AuthorID": "55576291300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7403623810": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "7403623810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7005604974": {"Name": "Sampson E.", "AuthorID": "7005604974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57213716994": {"Name": "Leavey G.", "AuthorID": "57213716994", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Bamford Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing, University of Ulster"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care, Population Health, University College"}, "7005718930": {"Name": "Omar R.", "AuthorID": "7005718930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College"}}}
