However, their independent contribution and importance of duration of PA and ST bouts remain unclear. We investigated associations between objectively measured PA, ST and non-invasive vascular measures, markers of CVD risk.Cross-sectional study of 1216 men from the British Regional Heart Study, mean age 78.5 years, measured in 2010-2012. Carotid intima thickness (CIMT), distensibility coefficient (DC) and plaque presence were measured using ultrasound; pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and augmentation index (AIx) using a Vicorder. PA and ST were measured using hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers.After adjusting for covariates, each additional 1000 steps per day was associated with a 0.038 m/s lower cfPWV (95% CI = -0.076, 0.0003), 0.095 10-3 kPa-1 higher DC (95% CI = 0.006, 0.185), 0.26% lower AIx (95% CI = -0.40, -0.12) and a 0.005 mm lower CIMT (95% CI = -0.008, -0.001). Moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA) was associated with lower AIx and CIMT, light PA (LPA) with lower cfPWV and CIMT and ST with higher cfPWV, AIx and CIMT and lower DC. LPA and ST were highly correlated (r = -0.62). The independence of MVPA and ST or MVPA and LPA was inconsistent across vascular measures. Bout lengths for both PA and ST were not associated with vascular measures.In our cross-sectional study of older men, all PA regardless of intensity or bout duration was beneficially associated with vascular measures, as was lower ST. LPA was particularly relevant for cfPWV and CIMT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometer", "Cardiovascular disease", "Epidemiology", "Physical activity", "Sedentary behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Exercise", "Humans", "Male", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Risk Factors", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Vascular Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973615729", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57169774400": {"Name": "Parsons T.", "AuthorID": "57169774400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "22955304900": {"Name": "Ellins E.", "AuthorID": "22955304900", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University"}, "6603008454": {"Name": "Halcox J.", "AuthorID": "6603008454", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University"}, "57189336097": {"Name": "Smith K.", "AuthorID": "57189336097", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University"}, "7404437968": {"Name": "Lee I.", "AuthorID": "7404437968", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}}}
