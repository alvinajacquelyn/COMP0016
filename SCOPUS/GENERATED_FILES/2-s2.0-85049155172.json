Design Data from two British birth cohorts, the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD, n=4199) and the 2001 Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, n=9417), were used to estimate and compare associations of infant weight gain between ages 0 and 3 years with adolescent outcomes. Main outcome measures BMI Z-scores and overweight/obesity at ages 11 and 14 years. Results Infant weight gain, in Z-scores, was positively associated with adolescent BMI Z-scores in both cohorts. Non-linearity in the MCS meant that associations were only stronger than in the NSHD when infant weight gain was above '1 Z-score. Using decomposition analysis, between-cohort differences in association accounted for 20%-30% of the differences (secular increases) in BMI Z-scores, although the underlying estimates were not precise with 95% CIs crossing 0. Conversely, between-cohort differences in the distribution of infant weight gain accounted for approximately 9% of the differences (secular increases) in BMI Z-scores, and the underlying estimates were precise with 95% CI not crossing 0. Relative to normal weight gain (change of '0.67 to +0.67 Z-scores between ages 0 and 3 years), very rapid infant weight gain (>1.34), but not rapid weight gain (+0.67 to +1.34), was associated with higher BMI Z-scores more strongly in the MCS (\u03b2=0.790; 95% CI 0.717 to 0.862 at age 11 years) than in the NSHD (0.573; 0.466 to 0.681) (p<0.001 for between-cohort difference). The relationship of slow infant weight gain (< '0.67) with lower adolescent BMI was also stronger in the MCS. Very rapid or slow infant weight gain was not, however, more strongly associated with increased risk of adolescent overweight/obesity or thinness, respectively, in the more recently born cohort. Conclusions Greater infant weight gain, at the middle/upper end of the distribution, was more strongly associated with higher adolescent BMI among individuals born during (compared with before) the obesity epidemic. Combined with a secular change towards greater infant weight gain, these results suggest that there are likely to be associated negative consequences for population-level health and well-being in the future, unless effective interventions are developed and implemented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescent health", "epidemiology", "general paediatrics", "growth", "obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Birth Weight", "Body Mass Index", "Body-Weight Trajectory", "Child, Preschool", "Correlation of Data", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Pediatric Obesity", "Pediatrics", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "Weight Gain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049155172", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57192175387": {"Name": "Johnson W.", "AuthorID": "57192175387", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55790281500": {"Name": "Bann D.", "AuthorID": "55790281500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}}}
