Methods: In a prospective phase II trial (EXCITE), patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined non-metastatic rectal adenocarinoma threatening/involving the surgical resection plane received pelvic radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine, irinotecan and cetuximab. Resection was recommended 8 weeks later. The primary endpoint was histopathologically clear (R0) resection margin. Pre-planned retrospective DNA pyrosequencing (PS) and next generation sequencing (NGS) of KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF was performed on the pre-Treatment biopsy and resected specimen. Results: Eighty-Two patients were recruited and 76 underwent surgery, with R0 resection in 67 (82%, 90%CI: 73-88%) (four patients with clinical complete response declined surgery). Twenty-four patients (30%) had an excellent clinical or pathological response (ECPR). Using NGS 24 (46%) of 52 matched biopsies/resections were discrepant: Ten patients (19%) gained 13 new resection mutations compared to biopsy (12 KRAS, one PIK3CA) and 18 (35%) lost 22 mutations (15 KRAS, 7 PIK3CA). Tumours only ever testing RAS wild-Type had significantly greater ECPR than tumours with either biopsy or resection RAS mutations (14/29 [48%] vs 10/51 [20%], P0.008), with a trend towards increased overall survival (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05-1.03, P0.055). Conclusions: This regimen was feasible and the primary study endpoint was met. For the first time using pre-operative rectal CRT, emergence of clinically important new resection mutations is described, likely reflecting intratumoural heterogeneity manifesting either as treatment-driven selective clonal expansion or a geographical biopsy sampling miss.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Camptothecin", "Capecitabine", "Cetuximab", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Staging", "Postoperative Care", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Rectal Neoplasms", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033408230", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6602512786": {"Name": "Gollins S.", "AuthorID": "6602512786", "AffiliationID": "60010389", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, North Wales Cancer Treatment Centre"}, "24478125000": {"Name": "West N.", "AuthorID": "24478125000", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "39561471600": {"Name": "Southward K.", "AuthorID": "39561471600", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "52163667400": {"Name": "Hemmings G.", "AuthorID": "52163667400", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "36899320000": {"Name": "Tinkler-Hundal E.", "AuthorID": "36899320000", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "57214041028": {"Name": "Taylor M.", "AuthorID": "57214041028", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "56387004900": {"Name": "Bottomley D.", "AuthorID": "56387004900", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "7102105039": {"Name": "Chambers P.", "AuthorID": "7102105039", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "6701695217": {"Name": "Sebag-Montefiore D.", "AuthorID": "6701695217", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "St James' Institute of Oncology, University of Leeds"}, "56246027300": {"Name": "Myint A.S.", "AuthorID": "56246027300", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre"}, "7201859372": {"Name": "Saunders M.", "AuthorID": "7201859372", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6505978416": {"Name": "Susnerwala S.", "AuthorID": "6505978416", "AffiliationID": "60010985", "AffiliationName": "Royal Preston Hospital"}, "57203231963": {"Name": "Quirke P.", "AuthorID": "57203231963", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Pathology and Tumour Biology Level 4 Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St James University Hospital"}, "12765142300": {"Name": "Essapen S.", "AuthorID": "12765142300", "AffiliationID": "105496199", "AffiliationName": "St Luke's Cancer Centre"}, "57220456773": {"Name": "Samuel L.", "AuthorID": "57220456773", "AffiliationID": "60024626", "AffiliationName": "Aberdeen Royal Infirmary"}, "55914703000": {"Name": "Sizer B.", "AuthorID": "55914703000", "AffiliationID": "60004413", "AffiliationName": "Colchester General Hospital"}, "7801494450": {"Name": "Worlding J.", "AuthorID": "7801494450", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust"}, "57196459124": {"Name": "Lawrie E.", "AuthorID": "57196459124", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre, University College London"}, "56719092100": {"Name": "Lopes A.", "AuthorID": "56719092100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre, University College London"}, "6603703560": {"Name": "Beare S.", "AuthorID": "6603703560", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre, University College London"}}}
