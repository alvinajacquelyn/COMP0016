The article relies on a unique large-N dataset on the functioning and staffing of EU government affairs. The analysis shows that companies delegate government affairs functions to in-house managers with specific competences, who stay in office for long periods and who have an extensive knowledge of the core competences of the company, thanks to their educational background and work experience in the private sector. These findings suggest that how companies strategically manage and staff government affairs in Brussels rests on the distinct structure of business\u2013government relations in the EU, which are based on the exchange of technical information and the establishment of credibility and long-run trust arrangements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["business and government", "corporate political activity (CPA)", "government affairs", "lobbying"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041375497", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)", "BUSI", "1401"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"7102713711": {"Name": "Coen D.", "AuthorID": "7102713711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56047074000": {"Name": "Vannoni M.", "AuthorID": "56047074000", "AffiliationID": "60021796", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e0 Bocconi"}}}
