Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) have severe face recognition problems, which may be linked to deficits in the perceptual processing of identity-related information from the eyes. We tested this hypothesis by measuring N170 components in DP participants and age-matched controls in response to face images where the contrast polarity of the eyes and of other face parts was independently manipulated. In different trials, participants fixated either the eye region or the lower part of a face. In the Control group, contrast-reversal of the eyes resulted in enhanced and delayed N170 components, irrespective of the contrast of other face parts and of gaze location. In the DP group, these effects of eye contrast on N170 amplitudes were strongly and significantly reduced, demonstrating that perceptual face processing in DP is less well tuned to contrast information from the eye region. Inverting the contrast of other parts of the face affected N170 amplitudes only when fixation was outside the eye region. This effect did not differ between the two groups, indicating that DPs are not generally insensitive to the contrast polarity of face images. These results provide new evidence that a selective deficit in detecting and analysing identity-related information provided by contrast signals from the eye region may contribute to the face recognition impairment in DP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contrast inversion", "Developmental prosopagnosia", "Face perception", "Face recognition", "N170 component"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Eye", "Face", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Photic Stimulation", "Prosopagnosia", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971617630", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56684209300": {"Name": "Fisher K.", "AuthorID": "56684209300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}, "55250224100": {"Name": "Towler J.", "AuthorID": "55250224100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}, "7005587916": {"Name": "Eimer M.", "AuthorID": "7005587916", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}}}
