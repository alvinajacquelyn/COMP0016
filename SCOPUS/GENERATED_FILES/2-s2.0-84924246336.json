We used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to study a cohort of nine Portuguese families who were identified during a nationwide, population-based, systematic survey as displaying a consistent phenotype of recessive ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA). The integration of data from these analyses led to the identification of the same homozygous PNKP (polynucleotide kinase 3\u2032-phosphatase) mutation, c.1123G>T (p.Gly375Trp), in three of the studied families. When analyzing this particular gene in the exome sequencing data from the remaining cohort, we identified homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in five other families. PNKP is a dual-function enzyme with a key role in different pathways of DNA-damage repair. Mutations in this gene have previously been associated with an autosomal-recessive syndrome characterized by microcephaly; early-onset, intractable seizures; and developmental delay (MCSZ). The finding of PNKP mutations associated with recessive AOA extends the phenotype associated with this gene and identifies a fourth locus that causes AOA. These data confirm that MCSZ and some forms of ataxia share etiological features, most likely reflecting the role of PNKP in DNA-repair mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Apraxias", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cogan Syndrome", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "DNA Repair Enzymes", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Microcephaly", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias", "Spinocerebellar Degenerations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924246336", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57200436456": {"Name": "Bras J.", "AuthorID": "57200436456", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56528431600": {"Name": "Darwent L.", "AuthorID": "56528431600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56528302500": {"Name": "Orme T.", "AuthorID": "56528302500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57200994996": {"Name": "Guerreiro R.", "AuthorID": "57200994996", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14022380700": {"Name": "Alonso I.", "AuthorID": "14022380700", "AffiliationID": "60105804, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, University of Porto"}, "7003345497": {"Name": "Barbot C.", "AuthorID": "7003345497", "AffiliationID": "60105804, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, University of Porto"}, "7005499969": {"Name": "Sequeiros J.", "AuthorID": "7005499969", "AffiliationID": "60105804, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, University of Porto"}, "7006153343": {"Name": "Coutinho P.", "AuthorID": "7006153343", "AffiliationID": "60105804, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, University of Porto"}, "55453277700": {"Name": "Costa M.M.", "AuthorID": "55453277700", "AffiliationID": "60014749", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Pedro Hispano, Unidade Local de Sa\u00fade de Matosinhos"}}}
