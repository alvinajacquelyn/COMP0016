Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the most effective way to reduce the risk of TB in HIV-1 co-infected people. Studying protective, ART-induced, immune restoration in HIV-1 infected individuals sensitised by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can thus help identify mechanisms of protection against TB. In order to understand ART-mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected adults, we investigated the expression of 30 genes in whole blood from HIV-1 infected patients during the first 6 months of ART-induced immune reconstitution. The 30 selected genes were previously described to be differentially expressed between sorted Mtb specific central and effector memory CD4 T cells. HIV-1 infected persons sensitised by Mtb were recruited in Khayelitsha, South Africa, when initiating ART. RNA was extracted from whole blood at initiation and 1, 3 and 6 months of ART. qRT-PCR was used to determine gene expression and three reference \u2018housekeeping\u2019 genes were used to calculate the fold change in the expression of each gene relative to day 0 of ART. Results were assessed longitudinally. We observed a decrease in the expression of a number of genes at 6 months of ART, reflecting a decrease in immune activation. However, following correction for multiple comparisons and increasing CD4 counts, only the decrease in CD27 gene expression remained statistically significant. While not statistically significant, a number of genes also showed increased expression at various timepoints, illustrating the broad regeneration of the T cell pool in HIV-1 infected adults on ART. Our findings generate hypotheses underlying ART-induced protective immune reconstitution and may pave the way for future studies to evaluate ART mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected persons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Coinfection", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunization", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Male", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Treatment Outcome", "Tuberculosis", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059229551", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57060448800": {"Name": "Jhilmeet N.", "AuthorID": "57060448800", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "57213673329": {"Name": "Lowe D.", "AuthorID": "57213673329", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "14028976400": {"Name": "Riou C.", "AuthorID": "14028976400", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "8206812200": {"Name": "Coussens A.", "AuthorID": "8206812200", "AffiliationID": "60027468", "AffiliationName": "Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"}, "56736504900": {"Name": "Goliath R.", "AuthorID": "56736504900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "7402272158": {"Name": "Wilkinson R.", "AuthorID": "7402272158", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7103117847": {"Name": "Wilkinson K.", "AuthorID": "7103117847", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "6506142685": {"Name": "Scriba T.", "AuthorID": "6506142685", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}}}
