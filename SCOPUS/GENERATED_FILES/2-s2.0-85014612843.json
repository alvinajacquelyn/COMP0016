The system consists of tyramine-conjugated gelatin and hydroxyphenyl acetamide chitosan derivative. Both are soluble and stable at physiologic conditions, which is a key factor for retaining viable cells and active growth factor. In situ gelation involved enzymatic crosslinking using horseradish peroxidase as a catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Gel formation occurred within 30-90 s by controlling the concentration of polymers. PDGF release showed adequate release kinetics within the intended period of time and hADSC showed good compatibility with the hydrogel formulation based on the in vitro assay and subcutaneous implantation into BALB/c-nu/nu nude female mice. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed viability of delivered hADSC. Histological analysis showed no immune reaction and confirmed blood vessel formation. The results implicate the hydrogel as a promising delivery vehicle or carrier of both cell and growth factor, which support vascularization for tissue engineering applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adipose stem cells", "cell delivery", "co-delivery", "enzymatic crosslinking", "injectable hydrogel", "vascularization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose stem cells", "Cell delivery", "Co deliveries", "Enzymatic crosslinking", "Injectable hydrogels", "Vascularization", "Acetamides", "Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cells, Cultured", "Chitosan", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Gelatin", "Humans", "Hydrogels", "Materials Testing", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Nude", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Tyramine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014612843", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56266492200": {"Name": "Linh N.", "AuthorID": "56266492200", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "55980248700": {"Name": "Abueva C.", "AuthorID": "55980248700", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Regenerative Medicine, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "7405436570": {"Name": "Lee B.", "AuthorID": "7405436570", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}}}
