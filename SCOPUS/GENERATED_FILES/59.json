All rights reserved.The population of children born with the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) continues to expand, and the oldest ART offspring are now entering adult life. Perinatal and birth outcomes have been studied thoroughly but there is a great emphasis on the need for future study of long-term outcomes. The health and prognosis of these offspring is increasingly relevant to: (i) ART-conceived children and their parents; (ii) couples considering fertility treatment; and (iii) the general population. This chapter summarizes current evidence regarding the health of children conceived following ART, encompassing perinatal and neonatal outcomes, congenital malformations, neuro-developmental outcome, physical health, psychosocial well-being, and the risk of cancer. Current evidence suggests that ART increases the risk of higher order pregnancies, prematurity and low birth weight, together with their associated health risks. Reassuringly, the evidence points away from increased cancer risks or neuro-cognitive problems. A number of unknowns remain, including future fertility, risk of cerebral palsy, and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, it is essential that follow-up of ART children continues as they progress through adolescence into adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ART", "Children", "Fertility", "Follow-up", "ICSI", "IVF", "Long-term outcome", "Prognosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948117693", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"23967807400": {"Name": "Abdel-Mannan O.", "AuthorID": "23967807400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "General and Adolescent Paediatric Unit, Institute of Child Health"}, "7005644774": {"Name": "Sutcliffe A.", "AuthorID": "7005644774", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "General and Adolescent Paediatric Unit, Institute of Child Health"}}}
