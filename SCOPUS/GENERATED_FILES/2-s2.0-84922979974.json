The orphan chemoattractant receptor GPR15 mediates regulatory T cell homing and immunosuppression in the mouse colon. We show that GPR15 is also expressed by mouse TH17 and TH1 effector cells and is required for colitis in a model that depends on the trafficking of these cells to the colon. In humans GPR15 is expressed by effector cells, including pathogenic TH2 cells in ulcerative colitis, but is expressed poorly or not at all by colon regulatory T (Treg) cells. The TH2 transcriptional activator GATA-3 and the Treg-associated transcriptional repressor FOXP3 robustly bind human, but not mouse, GPR15 enhancer sequences, correlating with receptor expression. Our results highlight species differences in GPR15 regulation and suggest it as a potential therapeutic target for colitis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Colitis", "Colon", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Humans", "Mice", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing", "Receptors, Peptide", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922979974", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"8161318000": {"Name": "Nguyen L.P.", "AuthorID": "8161318000", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research"}, "9037245000": {"Name": "Habtezion A.", "AuthorID": "9037245000", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University, School of Medicine"}, "7404098216": {"Name": "Pan J.", "AuthorID": "7404098216", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research"}, "6507942346": {"Name": "Hadeiba H.", "AuthorID": "6507942346", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research"}, "36893293500": {"Name": "O'hara E.", "AuthorID": "36893293500", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research"}, "56464279800": {"Name": "Ebtikar A.", "AuthorID": "56464279800", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research"}, "7102193127": {"Name": "Butcher E.C.", "AuthorID": "7102193127", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University, School of Medicine"}, "37030904800": {"Name": "Dinh T.T.", "AuthorID": "37030904800", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University, School of Medicine"}, "24390236700": {"Name": "Hertweck A.", "AuthorID": "24390236700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7004044168": {"Name": "Jenner R.G.", "AuthorID": "7004044168", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55312614700": {"Name": "G\u00f6kmen M.R.", "AuthorID": "55312614700", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunobiology, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital, King's College London"}, "7006574717": {"Name": "Lord G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006574717", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunobiology, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital, King's College London"}}}
