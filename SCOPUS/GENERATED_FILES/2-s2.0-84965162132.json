The concept of using a remote collection of survey data with Architectural Photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning has been accepted in several heritage locations worldwide. Additionally, the combination of the resulting information and Building Information Modelling has been developed as a technique to manage and document these historical buildings. In the last 20 years, several traditional approaches have been used to document, record, and survey heritage buildings in Historic Jeddah; however, these techniques have sometimes delivered unreliable information, taken a long time and inevitably omitted key details. This paper will focus on using Jeddah Historical Building Information Modelling; to produce complete engineering information and drawings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BIM", "Historical Jeddah", "JHBIM", "TLS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Architectural photogrammetries", "Building Information Modelling", "Engineering information", "Historical Jeddah", "JHBIM", "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia", "Terrestrial laser scanning", "Traditional approaches"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965162132", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"]], "AuthorData": {"56541473700": {"Name": "Baik A.", "AuthorID": "56541473700", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London UCL"}, "57147072600": {"Name": "Boehm J.", "AuthorID": "57147072600", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London UCL"}}}
