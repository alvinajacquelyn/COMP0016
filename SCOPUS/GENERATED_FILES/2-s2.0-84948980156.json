Harvey combined a review of long-term trends in painting, literature, photography, cinema, philosophy and social theory with a historical materialist analysis of economic transformation. He argued that there has been a seachange in cultural and political-economic practices since the early 1970s, linked to the emergence of new dominant ways in which we experience space and time, themselves the product of the gradual transition of capitalism from a Fordist to a 'flexible' regime of accumulation. The book quickly gained a wide appeal thanks to Harvey's innovative, cross-disciplinary, erudite yet accessible att empt to develop a combined analysis of economic, political and cultural change under conditions of capitalist globalization. It helped establish Harvey not just as one of the most influential figures in geography, but also as a recognized social theorist known in other disciplines. After a brief summary of the book, its reception and the debates which followed its publication, I focus on the book's 'urban' dimension and analyze its legacy for urban studies. In The Condition Harvey was one of the first scholars to highlight the mobilization of 'culture' in new strategies of urban (re)development and urban entrepreneurialism in 'post-industrial' cities, and thus of culture's fundamental role in the transformation of urban capitalism. In the conclusion of The Condition Harvey invited researchers working within urban political economy to give serious recognition to culture and to the production of images and discourses in urban development processes, a call taken up by a growing number of scholars. I discuss how this has inspired my work as a young researcher on urban politics, culture, place marketing and planning in European cities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948980156", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"20733551300": {"Name": "Colomb C.", "AuthorID": "20733551300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
