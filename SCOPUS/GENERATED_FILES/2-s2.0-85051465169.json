The line lists, OYT-35 and OYT-37, are suitable for temperatures up to T = 1200 K and consider transitions with rotational excitation up to J = 85 in the wavenumber range 0 - 6400 cm-1 (wavelengths\u03bb > 1.56\u03bcm). Over 166 billion transitions among 10.2 million energy levels have been calculated variationally for each line list using a new empirically refined potential energy surface, determined by refining to 739 experimentally derived energy levels up to J = 5, and an established ab initio dipole moment surface. The OYT line lists show excellent agreement with newly measured high-temperature infrared absorption cross-sections, reproducing both strong and weak intensity features across the spectrum. The line lists are available from the ExoMol database and the CDS database.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ISM: molecules", "Molecular data", "Opacity", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Stars: atmospheres"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051465169", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56678364300": {"Name": "Owens A.", "AuthorID": "56678364300", "AffiliationID": "60030635", "AffiliationName": "Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY"}, "27667898400": {"Name": "Yachmenev A.", "AuthorID": "27667898400", "AffiliationID": "60030635", "AffiliationName": "Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY"}, "7101780684": {"Name": "Thiel W.", "AuthorID": "7101780684", "AffiliationID": "60018135", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung"}, "57197593770": {"Name": "Fateev A.", "AuthorID": "57197593770", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Technical University of Denmark, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
