The science payload includes an optical camera, JANUS, which will perform imaging and mapping observations of Jupiter, its moons and icy rings. A 13 slot filter wheel will be used to provide spectral information in order for the JANUS experiment to study the geology and physical properties of Ganymede, Europa and Io, and to investigate processes and structures in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The sensor selected for JANUS is the back-Thinned CIS115, a 3 MPixel CMOS Image Sensor from e2v technologies. The CIS115 has a 4-Transistor pixel design with a pinned photodiode to improve signal to noise performance by reducing dark current and allowing for reset level subtraction. The JUICE mission will consist of an 8 year cruise phase followed by a 3 year science phase in the Jovian system. Models of the radiation environment throughout the JUICE mission predict that the End of Life (EOL) non-ionising damage will be equivalent to 1010 protons cm-2 (10 MeV) and the EOL ionising dose will be 100 krad(Si), once the shielding from the spacecraft and instrument design is taken into account. An extensive radiation campaign is therefore being carried out to qualify and characterise the CIS115 for JANUS, as well as other space and terrestrial applications. Radiation testing to take the CIS115 to twice the ionising dose and displacement damage levels was completed in 2015 and the change in sensor performance has been characterised. Good sensor performance has been observed following irradiation and a summary of the key results from the campaign using gamma irradiation (ionising dose) will be presented here, including its soft X-ray detection capabilities, flat-band voltage shift and readout noise. In 2016, further radiation campaigns on flight-representative CIS115s will be undertaken and their results will be disseminated in future publications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["4T", "CIS115", "CMOS APS", "displacement damage", "ionising damage", "JANUS"], "IndexKeywords": ["CIS115", "CMOS APS", "Displacement damages", "ionising damage", "JANUS"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992573931", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"54390046300": {"Name": "Soman M.", "AuthorID": "54390046300", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University"}, "55910612200": {"Name": "Allanwood E.", "AuthorID": "55910612200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University"}, "7202996580": {"Name": "Holland A.", "AuthorID": "7202996580", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University"}, "7007134520": {"Name": "Stefanov K.", "AuthorID": "7007134520", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University"}, "7005933791": {"Name": "Leese M.", "AuthorID": "7005933791", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University"}, "22984865200": {"Name": "Gow J.", "AuthorID": "22984865200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University"}, "55580955500": {"Name": "Pratlong J.", "AuthorID": "55580955500", "AffiliationID": "117260818", "AffiliationName": "Technologies"}, "55605774460": {"Name": "Smith D.", "AuthorID": "55605774460", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, Brunel University London"}}}
