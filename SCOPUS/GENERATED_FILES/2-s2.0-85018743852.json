Arthritis Care & Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American College of Rheumatology.Objective: B cell\u2013depletion therapy based on rituximab is a therapeutic option for refractory disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this observational study was to document long-term effects on B cell function by following serum immunoglobulin levels in patients with SLE treated with rituximab in routine clinical practice. Methods: We included 57 consecutive patients with SLE treated with rituximab and concomitant/sequential immunosuppressants and measured serum total IgG, IgM, and IgA and IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies, over a median of 48 months most recent followup. Flow cytometry was used prospectively to assess B cell phenotypes in 17 of 57 patients. Results: Twelve patients (21%) had persistent IgM hypogammaglobulinemia (<0.4 gm/liter), and 4 of 57 (5%) had low IgG (<7 gm/liter) at the most recent followup (range 12\u2013144 months). This was not associated with serious adverse events or high anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies (>1,000 IU/ml; normal <50 IU/ml). Factors predictive of low serum IgM included baseline serum IgM \u22640.8 gm/liter (receiver operator curve analysis) and subsequent therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; odds ratio 6.8, compared with other immunosuppressants). In patients maintaining normal IgM levels (9 of 17), the frequency of circulating IgD+CD27+ B cells was significantly higher (P = 0.05). At 12 months after rituximab, 7 of 30 SLE patients with baseline anti-dsDNA \u22641,000 IU/ml had lost seropositivity. Conclusion: Lower baseline serum IgM levels and sequential therapy with MMF were predictive of IgM hypogammaglobulinemia after rituximab in SLE, but this was not associated with higher levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies or an increased risk of infections. This provides useful directions for clinicians regarding rituximab and sequential immunosuppressive treatment for patients with SLE.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Biomarkers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin M", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Rituximab", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018743852", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"57200951428": {"Name": "Reddy V.", "AuthorID": "57200951428", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "6602679104": {"Name": "Leandro M.", "AuthorID": "6602679104", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "7003344107": {"Name": "Cambridge G.", "AuthorID": "7003344107", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "55321772700": {"Name": "Martinez L.", "AuthorID": "55321772700", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Hospital General Universitario, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n"}}}
