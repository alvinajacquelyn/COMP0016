A multi-method approach based on petrology, geochemistry and detrital zircon geochronology was used to define the provenance and transport history of these mainly Quaternary sands. A trend of progressive enrichment of ilmenite TiO2 content, from north to south, was observed. This reflects increased levels of weathering attributed to a wider coastal margin and shelf in the south combined with a succession of erosion and reburial events associated with interstadial and interglacial sea-level changes. Weathering took place during lowstands. Detrital zircon U\u2013Pb age signatures collected from 25 major river outlets along the coast of Vietnam helped to locate potential sand sources. Prominent age groups spanning 90\u2013120 Ma and 220\u2013250 Ma with a minor group at 400\u2013500 Ma are present in all of the detrital zircon U\u2013Pb age distributions of contemporary beach sands and Quaternary coastal dune placer deposits. Proterozoic grains are also present but constitute <10% of dated grains. The main source terrain for the placer sands is southern Vietnam where there are widespread outcrops of Mesozoic magmatic rocks. Detrital zircon U\u2013Pb age signatures from river sands that drain this area are identical to zircon age distributions in placer sands. River sands from northern Vietnam, the Mekong and its delta contain abundant Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons, which are largely absent from the placer sands, and so are ruled out as primary sources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ilmenite", "Provenance", "Seal-level change", "Vietnam", "Weathering", "Zircon U-Pb"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age distribution", "Coastal placer deposits", "Level change", "Multi-method approach", "Provenance", "Sealevel change", "Viet Nam", "Zircon U-Pb"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048950282", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"]], "AuthorData": {"57204884964": {"Name": "Nguyen H.H.", "AuthorID": "57204884964", "AffiliationID": "60187514", "AffiliationName": "Hanoi University of Mining and Geology"}, "56003358600": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "56003358600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "57190304698": {"Name": "Hoang L.V.", "AuthorID": "57190304698", "AffiliationID": "106652615", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Division of Vietnam"}, "57202640121": {"Name": "Vu S.T.", "AuthorID": "57202640121", "AffiliationID": "109496232", "AffiliationName": "Vietnam Administration of Sea and Islands"}}}
