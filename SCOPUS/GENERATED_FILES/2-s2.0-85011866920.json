Previous studies have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NFL) may serve this purpose. Methods: We cross-referenced the Swedish mortality registry with the laboratory database at Sahlgrenska University Hospital to produce a dataset of CSF NFL concentrations and mortality information for 715 MND patients, 87 FTD patients, and 107 healthy controls. Biomarker concentrations were analysed in relation to recorded cause of death and time of death. Results: MND patients had significantly higher CSF NFL concentrations than FTD patients. Both groups had significantly higher concentrations than the healthy controls (mean 709% increase in MND and 307% increase in FTD). Higher concentrations of CSF NFL were associated with shorter survival in both MND and FTD. Conclusions: The results of this study strengthen the notion of CSF NFL as a useful tool for determining disease intensity in MND and FTD patients. Further studies in patient cohorts with clinically subtyped and genetically classified diagnoses are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Biomarkers in CSF", "frontotemporal dementia", "motor neuron disease", "neurofilament light protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Neuron Disease", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Registries", "Survival Rate", "Sweden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011866920", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55345176500": {"Name": "Skillb\u00e4ck T.", "AuthorID": "55345176500", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}}}
