The Novel Assessment of Nutrition and Ageing (NANA) method is a touch-screen computer-based food record that enables older adults to record their dietary intakes. The objective of the present study was to assess the relative validity of the NANA method for dietary assessment in older adults. For this purpose, three studies were conducted in which a total of ninety-four older adults (aged 65-89 years) used the NANA method of dietary assessment. On a separate occasion, participants completed a 4 d estimated food diary. Blood and 24 h urine samples were also collected from seventy-six of the volunteers for the analysis of biomarkers of nutrient intake. The results from all the three studies were combined, and nutrient intake data collected using the NANA method were compared against the 4 d estimated food diary and biomarkers of nutrient intake. Bland-Altman analysis showed a reasonable agreement between the dietary assessment methods for energy and macronutrient intake; however, there were small, but significant, differences for energy and protein intake, reflecting the tendency for the NANA method to record marginally lower energy intakes. Significant positive correlations were observed between urinary urea and dietary protein intake using both the NANA and the 4 d estimated food diary methods, and between plasma ascorbic acid and dietary vitamin C intake using the NANA method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of computer-based dietary assessment in older adults, and suggest that the NANA method is comparable to the 4 d estimated food diary, and could be used as an alternative to the food diary for the short-term assessment of an individual's dietary intake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary assessments", "Older adults", "Technology", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Ascorbic Acid", "Biological Markers", "Computers", "Diet", "Diet Records", "Dietary Proteins", "Energy Intake", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Geriatric Assessment", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Nutrition Assessment", "Nutritional Status", "Reproducibility of Results", "Urea", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923576705", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56496642300": {"Name": "Timon C.M.", "AuthorID": "56496642300", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "UCD Institute of Food and Health, University College Dublin"}, "57196437487": {"Name": "Astell A.J.", "AuthorID": "57196437487", "AffiliationID": "60193816", "AffiliationName": "Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences"}, "55795533000": {"Name": "Hwang F.", "AuthorID": "55795533000", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading"}, "55728657800": {"Name": "Smith T.", "AuthorID": "55728657800", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading"}, "16400826100": {"Name": "Adlam T.D.", "AuthorID": "16400826100", "AffiliationID": "60017238", "AffiliationName": "Bath Institute of Medical Engineering, Wolfson Centre, Royal United Hospital"}, "56297305600": {"Name": "Maclean L.", "AuthorID": "56297305600", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60189574", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel Royal Hospital"}, "56496993300": {"Name": "Spurr D.", "AuthorID": "56496993300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Human Nutrition Unit, Department of Oncology, University of Sheffield"}, "9739525900": {"Name": "Forster S.E.", "AuthorID": "9739525900", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Human Nutrition Unit, Department of Oncology, University of Sheffield"}, "7403995130": {"Name": "Williams E.A.", "AuthorID": "7403995130", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Human Nutrition Unit, Department of Oncology, University of Sheffield"}}}
