We examined the influence of socioeconomic factors in childhood, middle-age and older age on oral health at older ages, and tested conceptual life-course models (sensitive period, accumulation of risk, social mobility) to determine which best described observed associations. Methods: A representative cohort of British men aged 71-92 in 2010-12 included socioeconomic factors in childhood, middle-age and older age. Oral health assessment at 71-92 years (n = 1622) included tooth count, periodontal disease and self-rated oral health (excellent/good, fair/poor) (n = 2147). Life-course models (adjusted for age and town of residence) were compared with a saturated model using Likelihood-ratio tests. Results: Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood, middle-age and older age was associated with complete tooth loss at 71-92 years-age and town adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) were 1.39 (1.02-1.90), 2.26 (1.70-3.01), 1.83 (1.35-2.49), respectively. Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood and middle-age was associated with poor self-rated oral health; adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) were 1.48 (1.19-1.85) and 1.45 (1.18-1.78), respectively. A sensitive period for socioeconomic disadvantage in middle-age provided the best model fit for tooth loss, while accumulation of risk model was the strongest for poor self-rated oral health. None of the life-course models were significant for periodontal disease measures. Conclusion: Socioeconomic disadvantage in middle-age has a particularly strong influence on tooth loss in older age. Poor self-rated oral health in older age is influenced by socioeconomic disadvantage across the life-course. Addressing socioeconomic factors in middle and older ages are likely to be important for better oral health in later life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Oral Health", "Periodontal Diseases", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Tooth Loss", "United Kingdom", "Vulnerable Populations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057762251", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"9743612700": {"Name": "Ramsay S.E.", "AuthorID": "9743612700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "56592813200": {"Name": "Papacosta A.O.", "AuthorID": "56592813200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "53865343000": {"Name": "Papachristou E.", "AuthorID": "53865343000", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology & Human Development, Institute of Education, UCL"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health UCL"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}}}
