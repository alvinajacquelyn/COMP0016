METHODS Patients registered with the United Kingdom Barrett's Oesophagus Registry from 9 United Kingdom centers were included. The outcome measures were (1) development of all grades of dysplasia; (2) development of high-grade of dysplasia or adenocarcinoma; and (3) development of adenocarcinoma. Prevalent cases and subjects with < 1 year of follow-up were excluded. The covariates examined were segment length, previous biopsy findings, age at surveillance, duration of surveillance, year of surveillance and gender. RESULTS One thousand and one hundred thirty six patients were included (total 6474 patient-years). Fifty-four patients developed adenocarcinoma (0.83% per annum), 70 developed high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma (1.1% per annum) and 190 developed any grade of dysplasia (3.5% per annum). High grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma increased with age and duration of surveillance. The risk of low-grade dysplasia development was not dependent on age at surveillance. Segment length and previous biopsy findings were also significant factors for development of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION The risk of development of low-grade dysplasia is independent of age at surveillance, but high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma were more commonly found at older age. Segment length and previous biopsy findings are also markers of risk. This study did not demonstrate stabilisation of the metaplastic segment with prolonged surveillance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrett's esophagus", "Dysplasia", "Epidemiology", "Esophageal neoplasms", "Public health", "Surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Barrett Esophagus", "Biopsy", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Progression", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophagoscopy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Precancerous Conditions", "Prevalence", "Registries", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Factors", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Watchful Waiting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008234039", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"27667553900": {"Name": "Gatenby P.", "AuthorID": "27667553900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL, Royal Free Campus"}, "56959880000": {"Name": "Bhattacharjee S.", "AuthorID": "56959880000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom Barrett's Oesophagus Registry, UCL"}, "56779631300": {"Name": "Wall C.", "AuthorID": "56779631300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom Barrett's Oesophagus Registry, UCL"}, "57210354319": {"Name": "Caygill C.", "AuthorID": "57210354319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom Barrett's Oesophagus Registry, UCL"}, "57207790053": {"Name": "Watson A.", "AuthorID": "57207790053", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom Barrett's Oesophagus Registry, UCL"}}}
