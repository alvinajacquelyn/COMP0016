The range of indications for liver transplantation is increasing but there is a mismatch between the numbers of available donations and current needs. Specific criteria for listing patients exist but, at minimum, the predicted mortality without transplantation must exceed that with transplantation, coupled with a 50% predicted 5-year survival following liver transplantation. The risk posed by liver disease must be weighed against the risk of liver transplantation, considering the patient's comorbidities, age, nutritional status and behavioural factors in a complex assessment process. This article reviews current UK practice in the selection and care of patients being assessed for liver transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Comorbidity", "Humans", "Liver Diseases", "Liver Transplantation", "Nutritional Status", "Patient Selection", "Preoperative Care", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis", "Tissue and Organ Procurement", "United Kingdom", "Waiting Lists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019081408", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55786156000": {"Name": "Halliday N.", "AuthorID": "55786156000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "34769374600": {"Name": "Westbrook R.H.", "AuthorID": "34769374600", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital, NHS Trust"}}}
