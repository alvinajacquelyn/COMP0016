This review examines whether the mirror system provides a unitary brain system, dedicated to imitation. The data suggests we can distinguish a visuomotor stream which permits both imitation and other visual-to-motor transformations, and also a top-down control mechanism. Working together, these systems permit both social and object-learning imitation to allow flexible human social behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922434605", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.F.d.C.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
