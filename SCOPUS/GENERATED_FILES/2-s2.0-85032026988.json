Unlike New Keynesian models that show similar price stickiness results, the market game model does not require enforcing menu costs or other additional restraints on price adjustment mechanisms in order to generate price stickiness. As such, we suggest that the market game model can provide a good micro-foundation for macroeconomic analysis. We then explicitly show the relationship between a typical firm's markup of price over marginal cost and its market share.", "AuthorKeywords": ["General equilibrium", "Market game", "Price rigidity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032026988", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57196149039": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "57196149039", "AffiliationID": "60015457", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Kansas"}, "57196151703": {"Name": "Korpeoglu C.G.", "AuthorID": "57196151703", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Management"}, "26326476000": {"Name": "Spear S.E.", "AuthorID": "26326476000", "AffiliationID": "60116234, 60027950", "AffiliationName": "Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University"}}}
