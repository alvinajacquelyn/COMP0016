All rights reserved.This article focuses on an emergent debate in organizational behavior concerning personality stability and change. We introduce foundational psychological research concerning whether individual personality, in terms of traits, needs, and personal constructs, is fixed or changeable. Based on this background, we review recent research evidence on the antecedents and outcomes associated with personality change. We build on this review of personality change to introduce new directions for personality research in organizational behavior. Specifically, we discuss how a view of personality as changeable contributes to key topics for organizational behavior research and how this new approach can help broaden and deepen the scope of personality theory and measurement. The study of personality change offers a range of new ideas and research opportunities for the study of organizational behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053817871", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"36505288600": {"Name": "Tasselli S.", "AuthorID": "36505288600", "AffiliationID": "60070152, 60022265", "AffiliationName": "Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University"}, "6603562680": {"Name": "Kilduff M.", "AuthorID": "6603562680", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}, "57190298822": {"Name": "Landis B.", "AuthorID": "57190298822", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}}}
