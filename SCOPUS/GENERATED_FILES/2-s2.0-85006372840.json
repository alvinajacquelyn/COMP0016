Using a longitudinal design and considering two children per family, we investigated mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 perceptions of coparenting as moderators of associations between their coercive parenting and children's disruptive behaviour. Methods: Mothers and fathers from 106 \u2018intact\u2019 families were included from the Twins, Family and Behaviour study. At Time 1 (Mchild age = 3 years 11 months, SDchild age = 4.44 months) parents reported on their coercive parenting and children's disruptive behaviour via questionnaire; at Time 2 (Mchild age = 4 years 8 months, SDchild age = 4.44 months) perceptions of coparenting and the marital relationship were collected by telephone interview. Questionnaire-based reports of children's disruptive behaviour were collected at follow-up (Mchild age = 5 years 11 months, SDchild age = 5.52 months). Multilevel modelling was used to examine child-specific and family-wide effects. Results: Conservative multilevel models including both maternal and paternal perceptions demonstrated that maternal perceptions of coparenting and overall coercive parenting interacted in their prediction of parent-reported child disruptive behaviour. Specifically, accounting for perceived marital quality, behavioural stability, and fathers\u2019 perceptions, only in the context of perceived higher quality coparenting was there a positive association between mother-reported overall coercive parenting and children's disruptive behaviour at follow-up. Conclusions: When combined with highly coercive parenting, maternal perceptions of high quality coparenting may be detrimental for children's adjustment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coercive parenting", "coparenting", "disruptive behaviour", "moderation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child Behavior", "Child, Preschool", "Fathers", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Marriage", "Mothers", "Parenting", "Problem Behavior", "Social Adjustment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006372840", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57191752981": {"Name": "Latham R.", "AuthorID": "57191752981", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psycholog, University of Susse"}, "57191749388": {"Name": "Mark K.", "AuthorID": "57191749388", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psycholog, University of Susse"}, "7103184743": {"Name": "Oliver B.", "AuthorID": "7103184743", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psycholog, University of Susse"}}}
