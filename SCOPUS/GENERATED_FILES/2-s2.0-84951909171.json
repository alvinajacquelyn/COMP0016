{"Title": "Osteoprotegerin (OPG), The Endogenous Inhibitor of Receptor Activator of NF-\u03baB Ligand (RANKL), is Dysregulated in BRCA Mutation Carriers", "Year": 2015, "Source": "EBioMedicine", "Volume": "2", "Issue": 10, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1331, "PageEnd": 1339, "CitedBy": 33, "DOI": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.037", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951909171&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015.Breast cancer development in BRCA1/. 2 mutation carriers is a net consequence of cell-autonomous and cell nonautonomous factors which may serve as excellent targets for cancer prevention. In light of our previous data we sought to investigate the consequences of the BRCA-mutation carrier state on RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) signalling. We analysed serum levels of RANKL, OPG, RANKL/OPG complex, oestradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) during menstrual cycle progression in 391 BRCA1/2-mutation carriers and 782 noncarriers. These studies were complemented by analyses of RANKL and OPG in the serum and mammary tissues of female cynomolgus macaques (n = 88) and serum RANKL and OPG in postmenopausal women (n = 150). BRCA-mutation carriers had lower mean values of free serum OPG in particular in BRCA1-mutation carriers (p = 0.018) compared with controls. Among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, lower OPG levels were associated with germline mutation locations known to confer an increased breast cancer risk (p = 0.003). P is associated with low OPG levels in serum and tissue, particularly in BRCA-mutation carriers (rho=-0.216; p=0.002). Serum OPG levels were inversely correlated (rho=-0.545, p<0.001) with mammary epithelial proliferation measured by Ki67 expression and increased (p=0.01) in postmenopause. The P-RANKL/OPG system is dysregulated in BRCA-mutation carriers. These and previously published data provide a strong rationale for further investigation of antiprogestogens or an anti-RANKL antibody such as denosumab for breast cancer prevention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations", "Breast cancer", "Cancer prevention", "Carcinogenesis", "OPG", "RANKL"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genes, BRCA1", "Genes, BRCA2", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome", "Heterozygote", "Hormones", "Humans", "Macaca fascicularis", "Mutation", "Osteoprotegerin", "Patient Outcome Assessment", "Postmenopause", "RANK Ligand", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951909171", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "16834524900": {"Name": "Burnell M.", "AuthorID": "16834524900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102793051": {"Name": "Fraser L.", "AuthorID": "7102793051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7203080137": {"Name": "Rosenthal A.N.", "AuthorID": "7203080137", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "26423945900": {"Name": "Philpott S.", "AuthorID": "26423945900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "6507446265": {"Name": "Reisel D.", "AuthorID": "6507446265", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "34975076100": {"Name": "Jacobs I.J.", "AuthorID": "34975076100", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "The University of New South Wales, UNSW"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7004813197": {"Name": "Dubeau L.", "AuthorID": "7004813197", "AffiliationID": "60022143, 60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Keck School of Medicine, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California"}, "35873382400": {"Name": "Cline M.", "AuthorID": "35873382400", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Section on Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "35447763800": {"Name": "Wood C.E.", "AuthorID": "35447763800", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Section on Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "56828449800": {"Name": "Pan Y.", "AuthorID": "56828449800", "AffiliationID": "60021048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Sciences, Amgen Inc"}, "56828847600": {"Name": "Yi P.C.", "AuthorID": "56828847600", "AffiliationID": "60021048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Sciences, Amgen Inc"}, "56388665700": {"Name": "Gareth Evans D.", "AuthorID": "56388665700", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genomic Medicine, Institute of Human Development, University of Manchester, St. Mary's Hospital"}, "6701416820": {"Name": "Dougall W.C.", "AuthorID": "6701416820", "AffiliationID": "60021048", "AffiliationName": "Therapeutic Innovation Unit (TIU), Amgen Inc."}}}
