The surface vibration on the CSAW devices was simulated using finite element analysis and characterised using laser vibrometry. Results showed that focused wave patterns and compact nodal distributions of vibration were formed at the centre of ZnO/Si CSAW device, which is contrast to an anisotropic wave distribution patterns generated by the same pattern of AIDTs fabricated on 128\u00b0 Y-cut LiNbO3. Simulation of liquid jetting induced by the isotropically focused CSAW was performed using coupled Volume of Fluid and Level-Set method. Results showed that a sharp and cylindrical liquid column was generated from the ZnO/Si CSAW device induced by acoustic energy coming from all directions within the plane due to the in-plane isotropic nature of the ZnO thin films. The simulation enabled us to capture the different streaming/jetting processes induced by the anisotropic distributions of acoustic pressure generated by the AIDTs on the 128\u00b0 Y-cut LiNbO3 CSAW device. The concentrated vertical droplet jetting behaviour from the ZnO/Si CSAW devices was investigated experimentally and supported the simulated results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Focused SAWs", "Isotropic", "Jetting", "Surface acoustic wave", "ZnO film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic distribution", "Cylindrical liquids", "Distribution patterns", "Inter-digitated transducers", "Isotropic", "Jetting", "Surface acoustic waves", "ZnO films"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061653137", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"25222867900": {"Name": "Jangi M.", "AuthorID": "25222867900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "54961968200": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "54961968200", "AffiliationID": "60000937", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Advanced Thin Films and Applications, College of Physics and Energy, Shenzhen University"}, "57204363403": {"Name": "Tao R.", "AuthorID": "57204363403", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria"}, "7404433406": {"Name": "Fu Y.", "AuthorID": "7404433406", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Rankine Building"}, "55574207230": {"Name": "Wilson R.", "AuthorID": "55574207230", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Rankine Building"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Rankine Building"}, "7401626391": {"Name": "Gibson D.", "AuthorID": "7401626391", "AffiliationID": "60097343", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Thin Films, Sensors & Imaging, Scottish Universities Physics Alliance, University of the West of Scotland"}}}
