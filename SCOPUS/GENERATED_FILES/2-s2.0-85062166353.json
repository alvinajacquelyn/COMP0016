It argues that the form and content of Blagden\u2019s diary developed in response to manuscript genres from a variety of contexts, including the medical training that Blagden undertook at the start of his career, the genre of the commonplace book, and contemporary travel narratives. Blagden was interested in the workings of memory and in the association of ideas. This paper reveals the diary\u2019s nature as an aid to memory and an information management tool. It argues that the diary assisted Blagden\u2019s attempts to secure the patronage of key figures in the eighteenth-century scientific world, including Joseph Banks, the Royal Society and a London-based network of aristocratic women. In exploring the development of the diary, the paper uncovers the role of a material object in aiding the management of patronage relationships central to the career of a significant but little-studied secretary of the Royal Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charles Blagden", "Information management", "Joseph Banks", "Patronage", "Royal Society"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062166353", "SubjectAreas": [["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57207031414": {"Name": "Wills H.", "AuthorID": "57207031414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
