However, the extent to which IR is associated with AD pathology in the cognitively asymptomatic stages of preclinical AD remains unclear. Objective: To determine the extent to which IR is linked with amyloid and tau pathology in late-middle-age. Method: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from 113 participants enrolled in theWisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention study (mean age = 60.6 years), were assayed for AD-related markers of interest: A\u03b242, P-Tau181, and T-Tau. IR was determined using the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Linear regression was used to test the effect of IR, and APOE\u03b54, on tau and amyloid pathology.We hypothesized that greater IR would be associated with higher CSF P-Tau181 and T-Tau, and lower CSF A\u03b242. Results: No significant main effects of HOMA-IR on P-Tau181, T-Tau, or A\u03b242 were observed; however, significant interactions were observed between HOMA-IR and APOE \u03b5 4 on CSF markers related to tau. Among APOE \u03b54 carriers, higher HOMAIR was associated with higher P-Tau181 and T-Tau. Among APOE \u03b54 non-carriers, HOMA-IR was negatively associated with P-Tau181 and T-Tau. We found no effects of IR on A\u03b242 levels in CSF. Conclusion: IR among asymptomatic APOE\u03b54 carriers was associated with higher P-Tau181 and T-Tau in late-middle age. The results suggest that IR may contribute to tau-related neurodegeneration in preclinical AD. The findings may have implications for developing prevention strategies aimed at modifying IR in mid-life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "apolipoprotein \u03b54", "cerebrospinal fluid", "glucose", "insulin", "insulin resistance", "tau protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Biomarkers", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Regression Analysis", "tau Proteins", "Wisconsin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930453413", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6507367402": {"Name": "Starks E.J.", "AuthorID": "6507367402", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "57214348238": {"Name": "Patrick O'grady J.", "AuthorID": "57214348238", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "12139793200": {"Name": "Hoscheidt S.M.", "AuthorID": "12139793200", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "55913313600": {"Name": "Racine A.M.", "AuthorID": "55913313600", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "7103143605": {"Name": "Carlsson C.M.", "AuthorID": "7103143605", "AffiliationID": "60073942", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Wm.
