However, most studies have used non-specific stimulation of cells rather than antigen-specific responses. Likewise, few studies have parsed out the direct effects of \u00df2AR stimulation on T cells versus indirect effects via adrenergic stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APC). Here we report the effect of salmeterol (Sal), a selective \u00df2AR agonist, on IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 and IFN-\u03b3+ CD8 T cells following stimulation with Cytomegalovirus lysate (CMVL-strain AD169) or individual peptides spanning the entire region of the HCMV pp65 protein (pp65). Cells were also stimulated with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Additionally, we investigated the effect of Epi and Sal on cytotoxic cell killing of transfected target cells at the single cell level using the CD107a assay. The results show that Sal reduced the percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 and IFN-\u03b3+ CD8 T cells both when applied directly to isolated T cells, and indirectly via treatment of APC. These inhibitory effects were mediated via a \u00df2 adrenergic-dependent pathway and were stronger for CD8 as compared to CD4 T cells. Similarly, the results show that Sal suppressed cytotoxicity of both CD8 T and NK cells in vitro following stimulation with Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with MICA*009 (T-CHO) and the human erythromyeloblastoid leukemic (K562) cell line. The inhibitory effect on cytotoxicity following stimulation with T-CHO was stronger in NK cells compared with CD8 T cells.Thus, targeting the \u00df2AR on lymphocytes and on APC leads to inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production and target cell killing. Moreover, there is a hierarchy of responses, with CD8 T cells and NK cells inhibited more effectively than CD4 T cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenergic agonists", "Catecholamines", "Immune function", "Lymphocytosis", "Sympathetic nervous system"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists", "Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Albuterol", "Animals", "Antigen-Presenting Cells", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Cytomegalovirus", "Enterotoxins", "Epinephrine", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "K562 Cells", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Phosphoproteins", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2", "T-Lymphocytes", "Viral Matrix Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924123119", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56085880600": {"Name": "Zalli A.", "AuthorID": "56085880600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "26423855300": {"Name": "Riddell N.", "AuthorID": "26423855300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Sports and Exercise, University of Birmingham"}, "9846365300": {"Name": "Goodyear O.", "AuthorID": "9846365300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7103406164": {"Name": "Moss P.", "AuthorID": "7103406164", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "12646563100": {"Name": "McGettrick H.", "AuthorID": "12646563100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham"}, "57203073378": {"Name": "Wallace G.", "AuthorID": "57203073378", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham"}, "7402323756": {"Name": "Bosch J.", "AuthorID": "7402323756", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam, Department of Clinical Psychology"}}}
