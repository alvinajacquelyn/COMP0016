Here we investigated the spatial scale of homeostatic changes in spine size following sensory deprivation in a subset of inhibitory (layer 2/3 GAD65-positive) and excitatory (layer 5 Thy1-positive) neurons in mouse visual cortex. Using repeated in vivo two-photon imaging, we find that increases in spine size are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) dependent and thus are likely associated with synaptic scaling. Rather than occurring at all spines, the observed increases in spine size are spatially localized to a subset of dendritic branches and are correlated with the degree of recent local spine loss within that branch. Using simulations, we show that such a compartmentalized form of synaptic scaling has computational benefits over cell-wide scaling for information processing within the cell. Barnes et al. show that TNF-\u03b1-dependent spine size increases are correlated with recent spine loss within dendritic branches in both inhibitory and excitatory cortical neurons in vivo following visual deprivation. Branch-specific plasticity increases information processing relative to global plasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Computer Simulation", "Dendrites", "Dendritic Spines", "Female", "Homeostasis", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Sensory Deprivation", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032589322", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36999204300": {"Name": "Barnes S.J.", "AuthorID": "36999204300", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "39761259400": {"Name": "Franzoni E.", "AuthorID": "39761259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London, 21 University Street"}, "54389320300": {"Name": "Jacobsen R.I.", "AuthorID": "54389320300", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "24729379700": {"Name": "Keck T.", "AuthorID": "24729379700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London"}, "6602690352": {"Name": "Erdelyi F.", "AuthorID": "6602690352", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60003354", "AffiliationName": "Medical Gene Technology Unit, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7401566134": {"Name": "Szabo G.", "AuthorID": "7401566134", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60003354", "AffiliationName": "Medical Gene Technology Unit, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "16241056400": {"Name": "Clopath C.", "AuthorID": "16241056400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "16316411900": {"Name": "Keller G.B.", "AuthorID": "16316411900", "AffiliationID": "60014441", "AffiliationName": "Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research"}}}
