Here, we ask if differences in the topology of the gene tree have any influence on the ability to infer positively selected sites. Using simulated sequences, we compare the results obtained for true and rearranged topologies. We find a strong relationship between \u201cconflicting branch length,\u201d which occurs when the set of sequences that experiences selection for a given topology and foreground is changed, and the ability to predict positively selected sites. Moreover, by reanalyzing a previously published data set, we show that the choice of a gene tree also affects the results obtained for real-world sequences. This is the first study to demonstrate that tree topology has a clear effect on the inference of positive selection. We conclude that the choice of a gene tree is an important factor for the branch-site analysis of positive selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Branch-site test", "DN/dS", "Molecular evolution", "PAML", "Positive selection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959370659", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"16307081300": {"Name": "Diekmann Y.", "AuthorID": "16307081300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "MACE Lab, Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "55940842900": {"Name": "Pereira-Leal J.", "AuthorID": "55940842900", "AffiliationID": "60017104", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia"}}}
