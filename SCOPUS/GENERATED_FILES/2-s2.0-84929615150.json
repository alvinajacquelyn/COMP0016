These diseases include disorders of fatty acid oxidation, glyco(geno)lytic muscle disorders and mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) disease. Clinically these disorders present with a range of symptoms including infantile hypotonia, myalgia/exercise tolerance, chronic or acute muscle weakness, cramps/spasms/stiffness or episodic acute rhabdomyolysis. The precipitant may be fasting, infection, general anaesthesia, heat/cold or most commonly, exercise. However, the differential diagnosis includes a wide range of both acquired and inherited conditions and these include exposure to drugs/toxins, inflammatory myopathies, dystrophies and channelopathies. Streamlining of existing diagnostic protocols has now become a realistic prospect given the availability of second-generation sequencing. A diagnostic pathway using a 'rhabdomyolysis' gene panel at an early stage of the diagnostic process is proposed. Following detailed clinical evaluation and first-line investigations, some patients will be identified as candidates for McArdle disease/glycogen storage disease type V or MRC disease and these will be referred directly to the specialised services. However, for the majority of patients, secondline investigation is best undertaken through nextgeneration sequencing using a 'rhabdomyolysis' gene panel. Following molecular analysis and careful evaluation of the findings, some patients will receive a clear diagnosis. Further functional or specific targeted testing may be required in other patients to evaluate the significance of uncertain/equivocal findings. For patients with no clear diagnosis, further investigations will be required through a specialist centre.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Caloric Restriction", "Diet, Fat-Restricted", "Enzyme Replacement Therapy", "Exercise Test", "Humans", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Muscular Diseases", "Riboflavin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929615150", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"7003917298": {"Name": "Olpin S.E.", "AuthorID": "7003917298", "AffiliationID": "60029387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Western Bank"}, "56497461300": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "56497461300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "12789499500": {"Name": "Kirk R.J.", "AuthorID": "12789499500", "AffiliationID": "60029387", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Diagnostic Genetics Service, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7405758539": {"Name": "Taylor R.W.", "AuthorID": "7405758539", "AffiliationID": "60105834, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}}}
