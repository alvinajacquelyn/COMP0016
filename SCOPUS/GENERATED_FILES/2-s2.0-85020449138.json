A common and effective collective variable (CV) has been defined using the ideally placed and highly conserved Trp6.48 as a reference point for ligand-GPCR distance measurement and the common orientation of GPCRs in the cell membrane. Using this single CV together with well-tempered multiple-walker metadynamics with a funnel-like boundary allows an efficient exploration of the entire ligand binding path from the extracellular medium to the orthosteric binding site, including vestibule and intermediate sites. The protocol can be used with X-ray structures or high-quality homology models (based on a high-quality template and after thorough refinement) for the receptor and is universally applicable to agonists, antagonists, and partial and reverse agonists. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) in predicted binding free energies for 12 diverse ligands in five receptors (a total of 23 data points) is surprisingly small (less than 1 kcal mol-1). The RMSEs for simulations that use receptor X-ray structures and homology models are very similar.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binding affinities", "Binding free energy", "Collective variables", "Extracellular medium", "G protein coupled receptors", "Reference points", "Root mean square errors", "Transition state ensembles", "Binding Sites", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Humans", "Ligands", "Models, Chemical", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Narcotic Antagonists", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020449138", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57189389614": {"Name": "Saleh N.", "AuthorID": "57189389614", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Computer-Chemie-Centrum and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials Friedrich, Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "57194505338": {"Name": "Ibrahim P.", "AuthorID": "57194505338", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Computer-Chemie-Centrum and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials Friedrich, Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "35271032500": {"Name": "Clark T.", "AuthorID": "35271032500", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Computer-Chemie-Centrum and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials Friedrich, Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "23978674400": {"Name": "Saladino G.", "AuthorID": "23978674400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.L.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
