We aimed to determine whether ECG-risk markers of SCA are more prevalent in people with epilepsy. Methods: In a cross-sectional, retrospective study, we analysed the ECG recordings of 185 people with refractory epilepsy and 178 controls without epilepsy. Data on epilepsy characteristics, cardiac comorbidity, and drug use were collected, and general ECG variables (heart rate (HR), PQ and QRS intervals) assessed. We analysed ECGs for three markers of SCA risk: severe QTc prolongation (male >450 ms, female >470 ms), Brugada ECG pattern, and early repolarisation pattern (ERP). Multivariate regression models were used to analyse differences between groups, and to identify associated clinical and epilepsy-related characteristics. Results: People with epilepsy had higher HR (71 vs 62 bpm, p<0.001) and a longer PQ interval (162.8 vs 152.6 ms, p=0.001). Severe QTc prolongation and ERP were more prevalent in people with epilepsy (QTc prolongation: 5% vs 0%; p=0.002; ERP: 34% vs 13%, p<0.001), while the Brugada ECG pattern was equally frequent in both groups (2% vs 1%, p>0.999). After adjustment for covariates, epilepsy remained associated with ERP (ORadj 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.5) and severe QTc prolongation (ORadj 9.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 1317.7). Conclusions: ERP and severe QTc prolongation appear to be more prevalent in people with refractory epilepsy. Future studies must determine whether this contributes to increased SCA risk in people with epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anticonvulsants", "Biomarkers", "Cause of Death", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Drug Resistance", "Electrocardiography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Long QT Syndrome", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Netherlands", "Risk Factors", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Statistics as Topic", "Tachycardia, Ventricular", "Ventricular Fibrillation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923206623", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"47761281500": {"Name": "Lamberts R.J.", "AuthorID": "47761281500", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, UCL, University College London Hospitals"}, "8906436400": {"Name": "Thijs R.D.", "AuthorID": "8906436400", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University, Medical Center"}, "23974507600": {"Name": "Blom M.T.", "AuthorID": "23974507600", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Heart Center, Academic Medical Center"}, "7403011098": {"Name": "Tan H.L.", "AuthorID": "7403011098", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Heart Center, Academic Medical Center"}, "23490044700": {"Name": "Novy J.", "AuthorID": "23490044700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, UCL, University College London Hospitals"}, "54388091700": {"Name": "Belluzzo M.", "AuthorID": "54388091700", "AffiliationID": "60001138", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Ospedali Riuniti"}, "26435475000": {"Name": "Seldenrijk A.", "AuthorID": "26435475000", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013243", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University"}, "55800249300": {"Name": "Penninx B.W.", "AuthorID": "55800249300", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013243", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University"}}}
