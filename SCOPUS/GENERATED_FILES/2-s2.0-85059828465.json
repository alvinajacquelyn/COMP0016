Understanding what influences decision-making in HIV-positive people in Africa may help researchers and policy makers in the development of broader, more effective interventions and policies. Methods We used thematic synthesis and a grounded theory approach to generate a detailed narrative and theoretical model reflecting life with HIV in Africa, and how this influences ART adherence and engagement decisions. We included qualitative primary studies that explored perspectives, perceptions and experiences of HIV-positive people, caregivers and healthcare service providers. We searched databases from 1 January 2013 to 9 December 2016, screened all studies, and selected those for inclusion using purposeful sampling methods. Included studies were coded with Atlas.ti, and we assessed methodological quality across five domains. Results We included 59 studies from Africa in the synthesis. Nine themes emerged which we grouped under three main headings. First, people who are HIV-positive live in a complicated world where they must navigate the challenges presented by poverty, competing priorities, unpredictable life events, social identity, gender norms, stigma, and medical pluralism\u2014these influences can make initiating and maintaining ART difficult. Second, the health system is generally seen as punishing and uninviting and this can drive HIV-positive people out of care. Third, long-term engagement and adherence requires adaptation and incorporation of ART into daily life, a process which is facilitated by: inherent self-efficacy, social responsibilities, previous HIV-related illnesses and emotional, practical or financial support. These factors together can lead to a \u201ctipping point\u201d, a point in time when patients choose to either engage or disengage from care. HIV-positive people may cycle in and out of these care states in response to fluctuations in influences over time. Conclusion This analysis provides a practical theory, arising from thematic synthesis of research, to help understand the dynamics of adherence to ART and engagement in HIV care. This can contribute to the design of service delivery approaches, and informed thinking and action on the part of policy makers, providers, and society: to understand what it is to be HIV-positive in Africa and how attitudes and the health service need to shift to help those with HIV lead \u2018normal\u2019 lives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Africa", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Patient Compliance", "Patient Dropouts", "Poverty", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059828465", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"10539370500": {"Name": "Eshun-Wilson I.", "AuthorID": "10539370500", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco"}, "55367845600": {"Name": "Rohwer A.", "AuthorID": "55367845600", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University"}, "55630515200": {"Name": "Hendricks L.", "AuthorID": "55630515200", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University"}, "57220732075": {"Name": "Oliver S.", "AuthorID": "57220732075", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Africa Centre for Evidence, University of Johannesburg"}, "7102107652": {"Name": "Garner P.", "AuthorID": "7102107652", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evidence Synthesis in Global Health, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}}}
