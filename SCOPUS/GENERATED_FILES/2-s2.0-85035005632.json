Given that stage is incompletely recorded, we investigated the extent to which this indicator reflects underlying organisational differences rather than differences in stage completeness and chance variation. Methods We used population-based data on patients diagnosed with one of ten cancer sites in 2013 (bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, lung, ovarian, prostate, renal, NHL, and melanoma). We assessed the degree of bias in CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) indicators introduced by missing-is-late and complete-case specifications compared with an imputed \u2018gold standard\u2019. We estimated the Spearman-Brown (organisation-level) reliability of the complete-case specification. We assessed probable misclassification rates against current pay-for-performance targets. Results Under the missing-is-late approach, bias in estimated CCG percentage of tumours diagnosed at an early stage ranged from \u22122 to \u221230 percentage points, while bias under the complete-case approach ranged from \u22122 to +7 percentage points. Using an annual reporting period, indicators based on the least biased complete-case approach would have poor reliability, misclassifying 27/209 (13%) CCGs against a pay-for-performance target in current use; only half (53%) of CCGs apparently exceeding the target would be correctly classified in terms of their underlying performance. Conclusions Current public reporting schemes for cancer stage at diagnosis in England should use a complete-case specification (i.e. the number of staged cases forming the denominator) and be based on three-year reporting periods. Early stage indicators for the studied geographies should not be used in pay-for-performance schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasm Staging", "Neoplasms", "Registries", "Reimbursement, Incentive", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035005632", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57191581402": {"Name": "Barclay M.E.", "AuthorID": "57191581402", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60115291", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare and Outcomes (ECHO) Research Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "35495386300": {"Name": "Greenberg D.C.", "AuthorID": "35495386300", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60115291", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England"}, "57202757335": {"Name": "Abel G.A.", "AuthorID": "57202757335", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care)"}}}
