Based on a systematic literature search using MEDLINE, we report the main ethical developments in paediatric oncology clinical trials from 2003-13. The present knowledge about normative and empirical ethical demands in this setting is quantified and summarised in a list of 46 issues. This list primarily aims to provide readers with a comprehensive account of the main decision nodes and professional attitudes that enable families to make a safe, competent, and satisfactory decision about their child's enrolment, or non-participation, in cancer clinical trials. Our systematic Review shows how important it is for professionals to engage in a constant reflection on optimum trial designs, on the effect of offering trial participation on key family dynamics, and on the ways to understand families' needs and values accurately. In view of present scientific developments, we further emphasise the need to enhance societal awareness about research in children and adolescents, to prevent so-called research fatigue in small populations due to multiple solicitations or inadequate legal demands, and to reassess longstanding ethical certainties in the strictest view of promoting sick children's interests. This systematic Review allows a series of questions to be drawn to guide and encourage collective and individual endeavours that should lead to constant improvements in our research practices in paediatric clinical oncology research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Humans", "Medical Oncology", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964607580", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57188995412": {"Name": "Dupont J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "57188995412", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "Hospinnomics, Paris School of Economics, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006535031": {"Name": "Doz F.", "AuthorID": "7006535031", "AffiliationID": "60030640, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric, Adolescents and Young adults Oncology, Institut Curie and School of Medicine, University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}}}
