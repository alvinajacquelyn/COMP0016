In particular, we show how nonlinearity and dispersion engineering of tapered photonic wires can be employed to generate optical similaritons and achieve more than 10\u00d7 pulse compression. We also discuss the properties of four-wave mixing pulse amplification and frequency conversion efficiency in long-period Bragg waveguides and photonic crystal waveguides. Finally, the influence of linear and nonlinear optical effects on the transmission bit-error rate in uniform photonic wires and photonic crystal waveguides made of silicon is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bragg waveguides", "four-wave-mixing", "Nonlinear optics", "pulse compression", "wavelength conversion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bragg waveguide", "Dispersion engineering", "Nonlinear optical effects", "Optical nonlinearity", "Optical pulse engineering", "Photonic crystal waveguide", "Pulse amplification", "Transmission bit error rates"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951789414", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205067505": {"Name": "Lavdas S.", "AuthorID": "57205067505", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College of London"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College of London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College of London"}, "57117325600": {"Name": "Osgood R.M.", "AuthorID": "57117325600", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Microelectronics Sciences Laboratories, Columbia University"}}}
