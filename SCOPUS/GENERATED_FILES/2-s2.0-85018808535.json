We sought to determine whether patient stratification by Perugini grade on 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy has prognostic significance in ATTR amyloidosis. Methods and results Patient survival from time of 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy was determined in 602 patients with ATTR amyloidosis, including 377 with wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) and 225 with mutant ATTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis. Patients were stratified according to Perugini grade (0-3) on 99m Tc-DPD scan. The prognostic significance of additional patient and disease-related factors at baseline were determined. In the whole cohort, the finding of a Perugini grade 0 99m Tc-DPD scan (n = 28) was invariably associated with absence of cardiac amyloid according to consensus criteria as well as significantly better patient survival compared to a Perugini grade 1 (n = 28), 2 (n = 436) or 3 (n = 110) 99m Tc-DPD scan (P < 0.005). There were no differences in survival between patients with a grade 1, grade 2 or grade 3 99m Tc-DPD scan in ATTRwt (n = 369), V122I-associated ATTRm (n = 92) or T60A-associated ATTRm (n = 59) amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloid burden, determined by equilibrium contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, was similar between patients with Perugini grade 2 and Perugini grade 3 99m Tc-DPD scans but skeletal muscle/soft tissue to femur ratio was substantially higher in the latter group (P < 0.001). Conclusion 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy is exquisitely sensitive for identification of cardiac ATTR amyloid, but stratification by Perugini grade of positivity at diagnosis has no prognostic significance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["99mTc-DPD", "ATTR amyloidosis", "Perugini grade", "prognosis", "skeletal muscle", "soft tissue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid
