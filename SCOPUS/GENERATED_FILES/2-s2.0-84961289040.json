The investigation of \u03b1-synuclein variants causative of familial forms of Parkinson disease can provide unique insights into the conditions that promote or inhibit aggregate formation. It has been shown recently that a newly identified pathogenic mutation of \u03b1-synuclein, H50Q, aggregates faster than the wild-type. We investigate here its aggregation propensity by using a sequence-based prediction algorithm, NMR chemical shift analysis of secondary structure populations in the monomeric state, and determination of thermodynamic stability of the fibrils. Our data show that the H50Q mutation induces only a small increment in polyproline II structure around the site of the mutation and a slight increase in the overall aggregation propensity. We also find, however, that the H50Q mutation strongly stabilizes \u03b1-synuclein fibrils by 5.0 \u00b1 1.0 kJ mol-1, thus increasing the supersaturation of monomeric \u03b1-synuclein within the cell, and strongly favors its aggregation process. We further show that wild-type \u03b1-synuclein can decelerate the aggregation kinetics of the H50Q variant in a dose-dependent manner when coaggregating with it. These last findings suggest that the precise balance of \u03b1-synuclein synthesized from the wild-type and mutant alleles may influence the natural history and heterogeneous clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aggregate formation", "Aggregation kinetics", "Aggregation process", "Aggregation propensity", "Dose-dependent manner", "Pathogenic mutation", "Prediction algorithms", "Secondary structures", "alpha-Synuclein", "Amyloid", "Binding Sites", "Humans", "Lewy Bodies", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease", "Peptides", "Phenotype", "Protein Binding", "Protein Isoforms", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Recombinant Proteins", "Solubility", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961289040", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36673526900": {"Name": "Porcari R.", "AuthorID": "36673526900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine"}, "7003800223": {"Name": "Mangione P.P.", "AuthorID": "7003800223", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "56502017200": {"Name": "Verona G.", "AuthorID": "56502017200", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "7003596824": {"Name": "Proukakis C.", "AuthorID": "7003596824", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102634392": {"Name": "Schapira A.H.V.", "AuthorID": "7102634392", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23988534300": {"Name": "Bolognesi B.", "AuthorID": "23988534300", "AffiliationID": "60032942, 60005479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomic Regulation, University Pompeu Fabra"}, "15840553700": {"Name": "Tartaglia G.G.", "AuthorID": "15840553700", "AffiliationID": "60032942, 60005479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomic Regulation, University Pompeu Fabra"}, "6603825748": {"Name": "Stoppini M.", "AuthorID": "6603825748", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "28667456400": {"Name": "Waudby C.A.", "AuthorID": "28667456400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57187798800": {"Name": "Paton J.F.S.", "AuthorID": "57187798800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55255485000": {"Name": "Mullin S.", "AuthorID": "55255485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6602803998": {"Name": "Cabrita L.D.", "AuthorID": "6602803998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55919826700": {"Name": "Christodoulou J.", "AuthorID": "55919826700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7007094071": {"Name": "Vendruscolo M.", "AuthorID": "7007094071", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "22133874500": {"Name": "Camilloni C.", "AuthorID": "22133874500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "55189659500": {"Name": "Penco A.", "AuthorID": "55189659500", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Genoa"}, "6701765355": {"Name": "Relini A.", "AuthorID": "6701765355", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Genoa"}}}
