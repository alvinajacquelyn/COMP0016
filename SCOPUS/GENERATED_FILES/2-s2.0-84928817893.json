This paper describes how the synaesthetic qualities of spices attracted a particular analysis in that emerging system which serves to mark them as different to other medical materials and foodstuffs. We aim to clarify the special role created for spices to accommodate their boundary-crossing synaesthetic action on the body. Material and methods This paper analyses the contents of several spice bags excavated in 1972 from a tomb that was closed in the second century BCE. It uses archaeological reports of material culture together with the early Chinese textual record, extant in both manuscripts and received texts, to bring out the role of spices in ritual, food and medicine. Results Noting that the flavours and aromas of early China were assigned physiological potency in the first centuries BCE, we argue that by medieval times the unique synaesthetic role that spices played in mediating the senses was systematically medicalised. While being deployed for the purpose of curing disease in medicine, they also remained within the realm of everyday healthcare, and religious practice, deployed both as aromatics to perfume the environment, attracting benign spirits, but also to ward off the agents of disease, as well as for enhancing health through their use in cookery. Conclusion While foodstuffs entered the digestive system spices were all considered 'pungent' in the emerging clasical medical system. They acted on the body through the nose and lungs, making them neither food nor drug. This implicit categorisation medicalised spices which, like music, could affect the passions and lighten the spirit, codifying observations about the impact on the body of the ritual environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Han dynasty", "Spice Sichuan pepper", "Yangsheng", "Zanthoxylum armatum DC"], "IndexKeywords": ["China", "History, Ancient", "Humans", "Medicine, Chinese Traditional", "Odors", "Perceptual Disorders", "Phytotherapy", "Spices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928817893", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"56127519900": {"Name": "Lu D.", "AuthorID": "56127519900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL China Centre for Health and Humanity, History Department, UCL"}, "7005645870": {"Name": "Lo V.", "AuthorID": "7005645870", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL China Centre for Health and Humanity, History Department, UCL"}}}
