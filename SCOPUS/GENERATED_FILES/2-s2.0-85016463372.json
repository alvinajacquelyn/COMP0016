We developed a nuanced and multifaceted conceptualization of sexual closeness in the form of a constellation of ideal sexual closeness with a partner, actual sexual closeness, and the discrepancy between the two. Data were obtained from a diverse sample of N = 619 participants who took part in the Lives and Relationships Study: A longitudinal survey of men and women in relationships living in the U.S. and Canada. Increases in sexual closeness discrepancies over a period of 1 year predicted concomitant decreases in two indicators of sexual well-being: sexual satisfaction and orgasm frequency evaluations. Decreases in sexual closeness discrepancies resulted in improvement in sexual well-being. Individuals who reported no sexual closeness discrepancies and experienced no changes in sexual closeness discrepancies tended to have the highest levels of sexual well-being. Importantly, sexual closeness discrepancies were robust predictors of sexual well-being, above and beyond individuals\u2019 actual sexual closeness, general relationship closeness, and other demographic and relationship characteristics known to be associated with sexual well-being. The present findings demonstrate that how close people feel sexually to their relationship partners is part of a general constellation of factors related to relationship closeness that, only when considered together, sufficiently explain the ways in which experiences of closeness impact sexual well-being in romantic relationships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Closeness discrepancies", "Orgasm", "Self-expansion theory", "Sexual satisfaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Canada", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016463372", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.M.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, School of Psychology, University of Surrey"}, "15051002300": {"Name": "McClelland S.I.", "AuthorID": "15051002300", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Women\u2019s Studies and Psychology, University of Michigan"}, "57193765875": {"Name": "Dettmann M.", "AuthorID": "57193765875", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}}}
