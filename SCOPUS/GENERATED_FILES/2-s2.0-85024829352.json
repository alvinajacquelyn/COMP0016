Despite the broad-spectrum therapeutic use of GC, the biochemical rationale for locally treating inflammatory skin conditions is poorly understood, as systemic GC production remains largely functional in these patients. GC synthesis has been well characterized in healthy skin, but the pathological consequence has not been examined. Here we show de novo GC synthesis, and GC receptor expression is dysfunctional in both nonlesional and lesional psoriatic skin. Use of GC receptor epidermal knockout mice with adrenalectomy allowed for the distinction between local (keratinocyte) and systemic GC activity. Compensation exhibited by adult GC receptor epidermal knockout mice demonstrated that keratinocyte-derived GC synthesis protected skin from topical phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced inflammatory assault. Thus, localized de novo GC synthesis in skin is essential for controlling inflammation, and loss of the GC pathway in psoriatic skin represents an additional pathological process in this complex inflammatory skin disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epidermis", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Keratinocytes", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Psoriasis", "Radioimmunoassay", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid", "RNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024829352", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8064394100": {"Name": "Hannen R.", "AuthorID": "8064394100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Biology and Cutaneous Research, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Bart's and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56530322800": {"Name": "Upton J.", "AuthorID": "56530322800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Biology and Cutaneous Research, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Bart's and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005271493": {"Name": "Philpott M.", "AuthorID": "7005271493", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Biology and Cutaneous Research, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Bart's and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57194186412": {"Name": "Udeh-Momoh C.", "AuthorID": "57194186412", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neuroepidemiology and Ageing Research Unit, Imperial Collage"}, "36067479700": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "36067479700", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60001888", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Synaptic Plasticity, University of Bristol, Dorothy Hodgkin Building"}, "56392217500": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "56392217500", "AffiliationID": "60005889", "AffiliationName": "LGC, Sport and Specialised Analytical Services"}, "7003717714": {"Name": "Halsall D.", "AuthorID": "7003717714", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "7201653508": {"Name": "Michael A.", "AuthorID": "7201653508", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "The School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24722573600": {"Name": "Gulati A.", "AuthorID": "24722573600", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, The Royal London Hospital"}, "7005846053": {"Name": "Clayton N.", "AuthorID": "7005846053", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, The Royal London Hospital"}, "6504820968": {"Name": "Rajpopat S.", "AuthorID": "6504820968", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Whipps Cross Hospital"}, "35429300900": {"Name": "Burrin J.", "AuthorID": "35429300900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7102232643": {"Name": "Flower R.", "AuthorID": "7102232643", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacology and Biochemistry, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6603724572": {"Name": "Sevilla L.", "AuthorID": "6603724572", "AffiliationID": "60032154", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}, "37034255400": {"Name": "Latorre V.", "AuthorID": "37034255400", "AffiliationID": "60032154", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}, "7201902660": {"Name": "Perez P.", "AuthorID": "7201902660", "AffiliationID": "60032154", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}, "57195036638": {"Name": "Frame J.", "AuthorID": "57195036638", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia-Ruskin University"}}}
