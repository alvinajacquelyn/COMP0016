Such tools were purposely introduced to disrupt the way designers generally interact with textiles and generate conversations around it. The study was conducted in a textile fair during two consecutive years with an expert audience who were in the mind-set of sourcing. This study resulted in four main themes that reveal the importance of the multisensory experience to textile selection, and the complexity of remembering and communicating such experiences in the design process, given how tacit such experiences are.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embodied experience", "Sensory perception.", "Textiles selection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design process", "Embodied experience", "Multisensory", "Research tools", "Sensory experiences"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991108192", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"55734658100": {"Name": "Petreca B.", "AuthorID": "55734658100", "AffiliationID": "60104069", "AffiliationName": "Design Products, Royal College of Art"}, "9234172400": {"Name": "Baurley S.", "AuthorID": "9234172400", "AffiliationID": "60104069", "AffiliationName": "Design Products, Royal College of Art"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College London"}, "23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College London"}}}
