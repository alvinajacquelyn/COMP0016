We propose a minimal scenario for such a purpose. Extending the LRSM framework to include these new vector-like fermionic fields, on the other hand, results in interesting phenomenological implications for the LRSM fermion masses and mixing. Furthermore, existence of such vector-like fermions can also have interesting implications for baryogenesis and the dark matter sector. The introduction of a real bi-triplet scalar which contains a potential DM candidate will allow the gauge couplings to unify at \u22481017.7 GeV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962473502", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"8903178300": {"Name": "Deppisch F.F.", "AuthorID": "8903178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56593152000": {"Name": "Hati C.", "AuthorID": "56593152000", "AffiliationID": "60104341", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"}, "56783145000": {"Name": "Sarkar U.", "AuthorID": "56783145000", "AffiliationID": "60014901", "AffiliationName": "Physical Research Laboratory"}, "33068193800": {"Name": "Patra S.", "AuthorID": "33068193800", "AffiliationID": "60079572", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University"}, "56050465700": {"Name": "Pritimita P.", "AuthorID": "56050465700", "AffiliationID": "60079572", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University"}}}
