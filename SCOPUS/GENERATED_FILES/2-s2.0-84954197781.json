In London, Project Indigo of the Metropolitan Police provides a unique, detailed framework for such data collection. We investigate such data to provide a contemporary account of SUDI in a large city and further link data to publically available datasets to investigate interactions with social factors. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data routinely collected by the Metropolitan Police Service in all cases of non-suspicious SUDI deaths in London during a six year period. Results: SUDI deaths are associated with markers of social deprivation in London. A significant proportion of such deaths are associated with potentially modifiable risk factors such as cigarette smoking and co-sleeping, such behaviour also being associated with social factors, including accommodation issues. Conclusions: Routinely collected data provide valuable insight into patterns and associations of mortality, with SUDI remaining a significant issue in London. Risk factors include social disadvantage, which may manifest in part by affecting behavioural patterns such as co-sleeping and public health interventions to reduce rates require significant social modification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosleeping", "Deprivation", "Infant death", "SIDS", "SUDI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dangerous Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Care", "Infant, Newborn", "Law Enforcement", "London", "Male", "Police", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Sudden Infant Death", "Urban Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954197781", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"23019186400": {"Name": "Kiho L.", "AuthorID": "23019186400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Camelia Botnar Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, Department of Paediatric Pathology"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "55487335700": {"Name": "Bamber A.R.", "AuthorID": "55487335700", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Wales, Department of Cellular Pathology"}, "57044383600": {"Name": "Upton S.", "AuthorID": "57044383600", "AffiliationID": "60113295", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Crime and Operations, SCO17, Metropolitan Police Service"}, "57044353900": {"Name": "Orchard M.", "AuthorID": "57044353900", "AffiliationID": "60113295", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Crime and Operations, SCO17, Metropolitan Police Service"}}}
