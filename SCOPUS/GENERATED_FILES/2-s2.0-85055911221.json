The worldwide rise of HIV since the 1980's, and the recent increase in common STIs (including HPV and Chlamydia) in many countries, means that there is an urgent need to understand transmission dynamics in order to better predict the spread of such infections in the population. Unlike many other infections which can be captured by assumptions of random mixing, STI transmission is intimately linked to the number and pattern of sexual contacts. In fact, it is the huge variation in the number of new sexual partners that gives rise to the extremes of risk within populations which need to be captured in predictive models of STI transmission. Such models are vital in providing the necessary scientific evidence to determine whether a range of controls (from education to screening to vaccination) are cost-effective.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude to Health", "Biobehavioral Sciences", "Contact Tracing", "Female", "Health Risk Behaviors", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Models, Theoretical", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Stochastic Processes", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Unsafe Sex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055911221", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35268336800": {"Name": "Datta S.", "AuthorID": "35268336800", "AffiliationID": "60024594", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research"}, "26642942600": {"Name": "Keeling M.J.", "AuthorID": "26642942600", "AffiliationID": "60163091, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Zeeman Institute: SBIDER, Warwick Mathematics Institute and School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Population Research in Sexual Health and HIV, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
