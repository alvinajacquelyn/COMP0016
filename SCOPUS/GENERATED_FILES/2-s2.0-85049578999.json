(1) \u03b4 Cells containing somatostatin (SOM) in the stomach corpus, small intestines, distal colon, pancreatic islets of both mouse and human express P2X1 receptors; (2) strong immunofluorescence of P2X1 receptors was detected in smooth muscle fibers and capillary networks of the villus core of mouse intestine; and (3) P2X1 receptor-immunoreactive neurons were also detected widely in both mouse myenteric and submucosal plexuses, all of which express SOM. The present data implies that ATP via P2X1 receptors is involved in SOM release from pancreatic \u03b4 cells, enteric neurons, and capillary networks in villi.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gastrointestinal tract", "Human", "Mouse", "P2X1 receptor", "Pancreatic islet"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans", "Islets of Langerhans", "Mice", "Myenteric Plexus", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X1", "Somatostatin-Secreting Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049578999", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"54389370800": {"Name": "Ji R.", "AuthorID": "54389370800", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "35217025200": {"Name": "Yuan H.", "AuthorID": "35217025200", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "56518387600": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "56518387600", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Neuroscience Research Centre of Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "57202849250": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57202849250", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Neuroscience Research Centre of Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "57188927068": {"Name": "Sui Q.", "AuthorID": "57188927068", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Neuroscience Research Centre of Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "7102138871": {"Name": "Xiang Z.", "AuthorID": "7102138871", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Ministry of Education, Neuroscience Research Centre of Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "7203075925": {"Name": "Knight G.", "AuthorID": "7203075925", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Neuroscience Centre, University College Medical School"}, "36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health"}}}
