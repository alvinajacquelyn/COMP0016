Here, we aim to clarify the pathophysiology underlying the hereditary geniospasm through testing of brainstem excitability by the recovery cycles of the blink reflex (BR) and the masseteric inhibitory reflex (MIR). The R2 component of the BR and the SP2 component of the MIR and their recovery cycle were analyzed in 3 patients and 8 healthy, age-matched subjects as the control group. Patients with geniospasm exhibited a different excitability of the BR, compared to the control, group, as shown by the larger R2 component area of BR in controls than patients. Notably, the mean recovery index was 0.61 \u00b1 0.19 in geniospasm patients and 0.40 \u00b1 0.15 in controls (P \u2264 0.05). Interestingly, the recovery cycle of the MIR showed a loss of inhibition in both patients studied, as indicated by the behavior of the SP2 component. Our cases showed a partial impairment of the activity of brainstem inhibitory interneurons, indicated by the abnormal recovery cycle of MIR. These results would implicate a mechanism akin to brainstem myoclonus for the generation of geniospasm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blink reflex recovery cycle", "Brainstem excitability", "Masseteric inhibitory reflex"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067371217", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35722502400": {"Name": "Macerollo A.", "AuthorID": "35722502400", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sense Organs, Aldo Moro University of Bari"}, "36651432300": {"Name": "Saifee T.", "AuthorID": "36651432300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "37013653800": {"Name": "Kassavetis P.", "AuthorID": "37013653800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55636904700": {"Name": "Pilurzi G.", "AuthorID": "55636904700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14036326000": {"Name": "Schneider S.", "AuthorID": "14036326000", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Kiel"}}}
