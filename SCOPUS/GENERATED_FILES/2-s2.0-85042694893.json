We applied the method to 48 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes as part of a real-time public health outbreak investigation, demonstrating that although active tuberculosis (TB) cases were diagnosed through 2013, no transmission events took place beyond mid-2012. Subsequent cases were the result of progression from latent TB infection to active disease, and not recent transmission. This evolutionary genomic approach was used to declare the outbreak over in January 2015.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genomic epidemiology", "Phylogenetics", "Transmission", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Outbreaks", "Genomics", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042694893", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57189702305": {"Name": "Hatherell H.A.", "AuthorID": "57189702305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CoMPLEX, University College London Research, Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "15070077500": {"Name": "Didelot X.", "AuthorID": "15070077500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "56835235600": {"Name": "Pollock S.L.", "AuthorID": "56835235600", "AffiliationID": "60090249", "AffiliationName": "Interior Health Authority"}, "57220998491": {"Name": "Tang P.", "AuthorID": "57220998491", "AffiliationID": "60107609", "AffiliationName": "British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Sidra Medical and Research Center"}, "55647772700": {"Name": "Crisan A.", "AuthorID": "55647772700", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60012171", "AffiliationName": "Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services, British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia"}, "7801475389": {"Name": "Gardy J.L.", "AuthorID": "7801475389", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60012171", "AffiliationName": "Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services, British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia"}, "31267498500": {"Name": "Johnston J.C.", "AuthorID": "31267498500", "AffiliationID": "60012171", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Prevention Services, British Columbia Centre for Disease Control"}, "16416871500": {"Name": "Colijn C.", "AuthorID": "16416871500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}}}
