Although previous studies have highlighted a stone tool-mediated shift from primarily plant-based to primarily meat-based diets as critical in the development of the brain and other human traits, we argue that digestible carbohydrates were also necessary to accommodate the increased metabolic demands of a growing brain. Furthermore, we acknowledge the adaptive role cooking played in improving the digestibility and palatability of key carbohydrates. We provide evidence that cooked starch, a source of preformed glucose, greatly increased energy availability to human tissues with high glucose demands, such as the brain, red blood cells, and the developing fetus. We also highlight the auxiliary role copy number variation in the salivary amylase genes may have played in increasing the importance of starch in human evolution following the origins of cooking. Salivary amylases are largely ineffective on raw crystalline starch, but cooking substantially increases both their energy-yielding potential and glycemia. Although uncertainties remain regarding the antiquity of cooking and the origins of salivary amylase gene copy number variation, the hypothesis we present makes a testable prediction that these events are correlated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbohydrate", "Copy number variation", "Diet", "Human evolution", "Preformed glucose", "Salivary amylase genes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amylases", "Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Brain", "Cooking", "Diet, Paleolithic", "Dietary Carbohydrates", "Digestion", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Energy Metabolism", "Gene Dosage", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Humans", "Nutritional Status", "Organ Size", "Saliva", "Starch"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938796782", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"36855701300": {"Name": "Hardy K.", "AuthorID": "36855701300", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies), Departament de Prehist\u00f2ria, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "25228623800": {"Name": "Brand-Miller J.", "AuthorID": "25228623800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Bioscience and Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney"}, "56767402600": {"Name": "Brown K.D.", "AuthorID": "56767402600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Environment and Evolution, University College London"}, "8606206600": {"Name": "Thomas M.G.", "AuthorID": "8606206600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Environment and Evolution, University College London"}, "7102081385": {"Name": "Copeland L.", "AuthorID": "7102081385", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}}}
