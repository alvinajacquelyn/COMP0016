Sensory nerves serve nociceptor and trophic functions, which can be affected independently or simultaneously. Loss of trophic function and consequent epithelial breakdown exposes the stroma making it susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Nerve pathology can range from attrition to aberrant re-generation with corresponding symptoms from anaesthesia to hyperaesthesia/allodynia. Many systemic and ocular conditions, including surgery and preserved medications can lead to NK. NK can be mild (epithelium and tear film changes), moderate (non-healing epithelial defect) or severe (stromal melting and perforation). Moderate and severe NK can profoundly affect vision and adversely impact on the quality of life. Medical management with lubricating agents from artificial tears to serum/plasma drops, anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics and anti-proteases all provide non-specific relief, which may be temporary. Contact lenses, punctal plugs, lid closure with botulinum toxin and surgical interventions like tarsorrhaphy, conjunctival flaps and amniotic membrane provide greater success but often at the cost of obscuring sight. Corneal surgery in a dry ocular surface with reduced sensation is at high risk of failure. The recent advent of biologicals such as biopolymers mimicking heparan sulfate; coenzyme Q10 and antisense oligonucleotide that suppress connexin 43 expression, all offer promise. Recombinant nerve growth factor (cenegermin), recently approved for human use targets the nerve pathology and has the potential of addressing the underlying deficit and becoming a specific therapy for NK.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Keratitis", "Matrix regenerating agents", "Nerve growth factor", "Neurotrophic keratopathy", "Trigeminal neve diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contact Lenses", "Cornea", "Corneal Diseases", "Epithelium, Corneal", "Humans", "Keratitis", "Ophthalmic Solutions", "Trigeminal Nerve Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047085192", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"7004633877": {"Name": "Dua H.S.", "AuthorID": "7004633877", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60025016", "AffiliationName": "Larry A Donoso Laboratory for Eye Research, Academic Section of Ophthalmology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Nottingham University Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "24465401500": {"Name": "Said D.G.", "AuthorID": "24465401500", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60025016", "AffiliationName": "Larry A Donoso Laboratory for Eye Research, Academic Section of Ophthalmology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Nottingham University Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "7006759220": {"Name": "Messmer E.M.", "AuthorID": "7006759220", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Ludwig Maximilian University"}, "7006006359": {"Name": "Rolando M.", "AuthorID": "7006006359", "AffiliationID": "118072702", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Surface Centre, ISPRE Ophthalmics"}, "7003912725": {"Name": "Benitez-del-Castillo J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003912725", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60032461", "AffiliationName": "University Complutense, Hospital Clinico San Carlos"}, "57201498066": {"Name": "Hossain P.N.", "AuthorID": "57201498066", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "14012045800": {"Name": "Shortt A.J.", "AuthorID": "14012045800", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, The Royal Free Hospital"}, "56208183000": {"Name": "Geerling G.", "AuthorID": "56208183000", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, University of D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "6602227800": {"Name": "Nubile M.", "AuthorID": "6602227800", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Clinic, National Centre of High Technology (CNAT) in Ophthalmology, University of \u201cG d'Annunzio\u201d, Chieti-Pescara"}, "7005567403": {"Name": "Mastropasqua L.", "AuthorID": "7005567403", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Clinic, National Centre of High Technology (CNAT) in Ophthalmology, University of \u201cG d'Annunzio\u201d, Chieti-Pescara"}, "7006323290": {"Name": "Figueiredo F.C.", "AuthorID": "7006323290", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60024240, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Victoria Infirmary and Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "6701449684": {"Name": "Rauz S.", "AuthorID": "6701449684", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60007419", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham (UK), Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre"}, "7004461897": {"Name": "Rama P.", "AuthorID": "7004461897", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and Ocular Surface Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7102848002": {"Name": "Baudouin C.", "AuthorID": "7102848002", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60004689, 60000905, 60157977", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology III, Quinze-Vingts Hospital, DHU Sight Restore, INSERM-DHOS CIC, Vision Institute, INSERM, U968, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s"}}}
