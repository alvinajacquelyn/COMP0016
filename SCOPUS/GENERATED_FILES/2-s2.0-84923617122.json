All rights reserved.Objective This study sought to assess the results of current laboratory studies of olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation for the treatment of central nervous system repair. Methods This study used a literature search and topic review. Results There are numerous successful reports of regeneration and functional improvements in animals after OEC transplantation, but a few negative studies raise questions. Conclusions Although the exact mechanisms of action of OECs are not fully understood, it is clear that OECs have beneficial regenerative properties in laboratory studies, and the ease with which OECs can be harvested and cultured in animal models make clinical application a very reasonable prospect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brachial plexus", "Olfactory ensheathing cell", "Spinal cord", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Neuroglia", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923617122", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56215684400": {"Name": "Gladwin K.", "AuthorID": "56215684400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
