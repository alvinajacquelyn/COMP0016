A computational approach was adopted to evaluate oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges between the liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) and the oxygenating gas, as a function of the geometrical parameter of the device. A 2D semi-empirical model was implemented to this purpose using Comsol Multiphysics to study both the fluid dynamics and the gas exchange in the ventilator. Experimental gas exchanges measured with a preliminary prototype were compared to the simulation outcomes to prove the model reliability. Different device configurations were modeled to identify the optimal design able to guarantee the desired gas transfer. Good agreement between experimental and simulation outcomes was obtained, validating the model. The optimal configuration, able to achieve the desired gas exchange (\u03b4pCO2 = 16.5 mmHg and \u03b4pO2 = 69 mmHg), is a device comprising 40 modules, 300 mm in length (total exchange area = 2.28 m2). With this configuration gas transfer performance is satisfactory for all the simulated settings, proving good adaptability of the device.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gas exchange", "Neonatal ventilator", "Numerical model", "Perfluorocarbon", "Total liquid ventilation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational approach", "Device configurations", "Gas exchange", "Neonatal ventilator", "Perfluorocarbons", "Semi-empirical modeling", "Total exchange areas", "Total liquid ventilations", "Calibration", "Carbon Dioxide", "Computer Simulation", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Hydrodynamics", "Infant, Newborn", "Liquid Ventilation", "Oxygen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949554442", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56814624000": {"Name": "Bonfanti M.", "AuthorID": "56814624000", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering, Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}, "36070490500": {"Name": "Bagnoli P.", "AuthorID": "36070490500", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering, Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}, "8290404800": {"Name": "Cammi A.", "AuthorID": "8290404800", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy, Nuclear Engineering Division (CeSNEF), Politecnico di Milano"}}}
