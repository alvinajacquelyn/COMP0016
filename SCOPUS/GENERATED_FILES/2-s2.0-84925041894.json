In transmission over 800 km of standard single-mode fiber, with a dual-carrier spacing of 0.8\u00d7 symbol rate, a Q2-factor penalty of only 1.7 dB, relative to single-carrier performance, is achieved. The performance of FD-MIMO for linear crosstalk mitigation is experimentally demonstrated by varying the channel spacing from 0.4 to 1.2\u00d7 symbol rate in a dual-carrier DP-16QAM and DP-QPSK back-to-back configuration. Three-channel FD-MIMO equalization for both modulation formats is also studied in the same configuration. In addition, the combination of optical filtering and FD-MIMO indicates that a guard band of 10% of the symbol rate is sufficient to avoid additional linear crosstalk from neighboring WDM channels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coherent", "digital signal processing (DSP)", "Multi channel equalizer", "multi-input-multi-output (MIMO)", "optical transmission", "quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)", "spectral efficiency (SE)", "wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)"], "IndexKeywords": ["coherent", "Digital signal processing (DSP)", "Multi channel", "Multi input multi output", "Quadrature-amplitude modulations (QAM)", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925041894", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55626583400": {"Name": "Sato M.", "AuthorID": "55626583400", "AffiliationID": "60031293", "AffiliationName": "Converged Network Division, NEC Corp."}, "16053296900": {"Name": "Maher R.", "AuthorID": "16053296900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
