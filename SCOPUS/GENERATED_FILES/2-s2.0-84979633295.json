Fourteen women with ASC (aged 22\u201330 years) diagnosed in late adolescence or adulthood gave in-depth accounts of: \u2018pretending to be normal\u2019; of how their gender led various professionals to miss their ASC; and of conflicts between ASC and a traditional feminine identity. Experiences of sexual abuse were widespread in this sample, partially reflecting specific vulnerabilities from being a female with undiagnosed ASC. Training would improve teachers\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 recognition of ASC in females, so that timely identification can mitigate risks and promote wellbeing of girls and women on the autism spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum conditions (ASC)", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)", "Diagnosis", "Female autism phenotype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Phenotype", "Sex Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979633295", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57190386078": {"Name": "Bargiela S.", "AuthorID": "57190386078", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, UCL"}, "9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, UCL"}, "54921744700": {"Name": "Steward R.", "AuthorID": "54921744700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
