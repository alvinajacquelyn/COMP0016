The effects of sexual differences in host phenology have been little explored in wildlife epidemiological studies. A recent series of ranavirosis outbreaks led to serious declines of Boscas\u2019 newt populations at Serra da Estrela (Portugal). The peculiar phenology of this species, in which a large number of females remain in the aquatic habitat after the breeding season, turns it into a suitable model to test how sex-biased mortality can affect host population persistence in the context of infectious diseases. We investigated how the phenology of Bosca's newt (i.e. biased number of females) mediated the impact of Ranavirus. We then evaluated the risk of extinction of the population under different scenarios of sex-biased mortality using a population viability analysis. Two newt populations (one subject to yearly outbreaks and a comparative site where outbreaks have not been recorded) were tracked for trends over time following emergence of ranaviral disease, allowing us to assess the differential impact of the disease on both sexes. In addition to a significant decline in abundance of adult newts, our data suggest that phenology can affect disease dynamics indirectly, leading to reduction in females and a reversal of the sex ratio of the breeding population. Our models suggest that female-biased mortality does not exacerbate Ranavirus-driven population declines in the short-term, but is likely to have a deleterious impact during the recovery process once the lethal effect of disease is removed from the system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bosca's newt", "emerging infectious diseases", "host\u2013pathogen dynamics", "Lissotriton boscai", "phenology", "population viability analysis", "Ranavirus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064605286", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"57210846772": {"Name": "Rosa G.M.", "AuthorID": "57210846772", "AffiliationID": "60002769", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes (CE3C), Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "57220607253": {"Name": "Griffiths R.A.", "AuthorID": "57220607253", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "7005973727": {"Name": "Garner T.W.J.", "AuthorID": "7005973727", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "13907587200": {"Name": "Rebelo R.", "AuthorID": "13907587200", "AffiliationID": "60002769", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes (CE3C), Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "34567498400": {"Name": "Bosch J.", "AuthorID": "34567498400", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, CSIC"}, "7102242164": {"Name": "Martel A.", "AuthorID": "7102242164", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Avian Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University"}, "7003936223": {"Name": "Pasmans F.", "AuthorID": "7003936223", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Avian Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University"}}}
