Objectives We compared anticipation of reward between major psychiatric disorders, and investigated whether reward anticipation is impaired in several mental disorders and whether there is a common psychopathological correlate (negative mood) of such an impairment. Methods We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a monetary incentive delay (MID) task to study the functional correlates of reward anticipation across major psychiatric disorders in 184 subjects, with the diagnoses of alcohol dependence (n=26), schizophrenia (n=44), major depressive disorder (MDD, n=24), bipolar disorder (acute manic episode, n=13), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n=23), and healthy controls (n=54). Subjects' individual Beck Depression Inventory-and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-scores were correlated with clusters showing significant activation during reward anticipation. Results During reward anticipation, we observed significant group differences in ventral striatal (VS) activation: patients with schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, and major depression showed significantly less ventral striatal activation compared to healthy controls. Depressive symptoms correlated with dysfunction in reward anticipation regardless of diagnostic entity. There was no significant correlation between anxiety symptoms and VS functional activation. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a neurobiological dysfunction related to reward prediction that transcended disorder categories and was related to measures of depressed mood. The findings underline the potential of a dimensional approach in psychiatry and strengthen the hypothesis that neu-robiological research in psychiatric disorders can be targeted at core mechanisms that are likely to be implicated in a range of clinical entities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depressive symptoms", "Dimensional.fMRI", "Monetary incentive delay task", "Reward system", "Ventral striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Motivation", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychiatry", "Reward"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926479803", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"25958104800": {"Name": "H\u00e4gele C.", "AuthorID": "25958104800", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "11140368800": {"Name": "Schlagenhauf F.", "AuthorID": "11140368800", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "6602460323": {"Name": "Sterzer P.", "AuthorID": "6602460323", "AffiliationID": "112645562", "AffiliationName": "Berlin School of Mind and Brain"}, "35301843000": {"Name": "Beck A.", "AuthorID": "35301843000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "23135792000": {"Name": "Stoy M.", "AuthorID": "23135792000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "56577545000": {"Name": "Rapp M.", "AuthorID": "56577545000", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Potsdam"}, "6507795152": {"Name": "Bermpohl F.", "AuthorID": "6507795152", "AffiliationID": "112645562", "AffiliationName": "Berlin School of Mind and Brain"}, "7004609106": {"Name": "Str\u00f6hle A.", "AuthorID": "7004609106", "AffiliationID": "112645562", "AffiliationName": "Berlin School of Mind and Brain"}, "57201513357": {"Name": "Heinz A.", "AuthorID": "57201513357", "AffiliationID": "112645562", "AffiliationName": "Berlin School of Mind and Brain"}, "56472426600": {"Name": "Wittchen H.U.", "AuthorID": "56472426600", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Mind and Brain Centre, Humboldt University"}}}
