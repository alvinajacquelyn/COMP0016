It proposes using a geographical information system to store, display, edit, share and analyse geographical information for territorial decision-making. The method was used to help develop a sustainable energy action plan for the municipality of Randazzo in Sicily, Italy, by providing an accurate representation of actual energy consumption. Based on this case study, the use of a geographical information system appears to be a suitable support tool for both developing and managing sustainable energy action plans, regardless of the geographical area or context. This method will help municipalities estimate and monitor the energy consumption of residential, commercial and industrial buildings and, by taking into account the approaches of different stakeholders, help develop more accurate models for reducing urban carbon dioxide emissions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy", "Management", "Public policy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon dioxide emissions", "Energy", "Geographic information", "Geographical area", "Geographical information", "Industrial buildings", "Sustainable energy", "Urban energy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009402225", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"7003725643": {"Name": "Gagliano A.", "AuthorID": "7003725643", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Catania"}, "7004439906": {"Name": "Nocera F.", "AuthorID": "7004439906", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Catania"}, "56117157700": {"Name": "Detommaso M.", "AuthorID": "56117157700", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Catania"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
