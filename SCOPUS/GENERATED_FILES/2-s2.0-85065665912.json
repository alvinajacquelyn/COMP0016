All rights reserved.The rheology of shear thickening fluids is well characterized for many physical applications, however the literature surrounding biologically or cryobiologically compatible shear thickening fluids is less well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study examined fluids consisting of corn-derived hydroxyethyl starch with a variety of sugars and cryoprotectants to characterize their shear-rate viscosity relationship. The objective was to establish if cryobiologically relevant materials could be used to afford biologics protection through shear-thickening. RESULTS: Fluids consisting of 50% hydroxyethyl starch by weight exhibited shear thickening with a variety of cryoprotectants. Lowering the temperature of the fluid both reduced critical shear rates and enhanced thickening magnitude. Starch derived from corn, wheat, and rice all exhibited non-Newtonian shear-dependent viscosity behaviour at 50% by weight in water. Between the starch sources however, the shear-rate viscosity relationship varied widely, with wheat-derived starch shear thinning, and the remaining starches forming shear thickening fluids. Different starch sources had different baseline viscosities, critical shear rates, and rates of viscosity increase. CONCLUSIONS: This study established that shear thickening is compatible with cryobiologically relevant agents, particularly so at lower temperatures. This forms the basis for harnessing these phenomena in biological processes such as cryopreservation.
