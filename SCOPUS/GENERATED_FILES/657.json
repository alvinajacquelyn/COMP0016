The present study investigates the role of MD as a specific social-cognitive construct that, in the organizational context, may intervene in the process leading from stressors to counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Assuming the theoretical framework of the stressor-emotion model of CWB, we hypothesized that MD mediates, at least partially, the relation between negative emotions in reaction to perceived stressors and CWB by promoting or justifying aggressive responses to frustrating situations or events. In a sample of 1,147 Italian workers, we tested a structural equations model. The results support our hypothesis: the more workers experienced negative emotions in response to stressors, the more they morally disengaged and, in turn, enacted CWB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggression", "Counterproductive work behavior", "Job stressor", "Moral disengagement", "Negative emotions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939460935", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"23469112400": {"Name": "Fida R.", "AuthorID": "23469112400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6603818404": {"Name": "Barbaranelli C.", "AuthorID": "6603818404", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "54794965500": {"Name": "Farnese M.", "AuthorID": "54794965500", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "24607689500": {"Name": "Paciello M.", "AuthorID": "24607689500", "AffiliationID": "60104320", "AffiliationName": "International Telematic University Uninettuno"}, "24829505600": {"Name": "Tramontano C.", "AuthorID": "24829505600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre UCL"}, "7102597513": {"Name": "Fontaine R.", "AuthorID": "7102597513", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Social Science Research Institute, Center for Child and Family Policy, Duke University"}}}
