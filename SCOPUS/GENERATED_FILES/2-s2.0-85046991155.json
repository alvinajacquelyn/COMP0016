Programmatic LTBI screening is a key intervention of the TB strategy for England. This article reviews the results of a long-standing LTBI screening initiative in England.A retrospective cohort was created through probabilistic linkage between LTBI screening data and national TB case notifications. Screened persons were followed until they died, became a case, emigrated or until cohort-end. TB incidence rates and rate ratios (IRR) were calculated.97 out of 1820 individuals screened for LTBI were reported to have active TB. Crude incidence rates among LTBI-positive, treatment-na\u00efve individuals were 4.1 and 2.3 per 100 person-years in the QuantiFERON and tuberculin skin test cohorts, respectively. Among the QuantiFERON cohort, Poisson regression showed that LTBI positivity (IRR 22.6, 95% CI 6.8-74.6) and no chemoprophylaxis increased the probability of becoming a TB case (IRR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.6).We found high TB rates in LTBI-positive, treatment-na\u00efve individuals and a strong association between no treatment and becoming a TB case, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness of LTBI screening and providing important policy lessons for LTBI screening in England and beyond.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Databases, Factual", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Multivariate Analysis", "Regression Analysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Tuberculin Test", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046991155", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"6505927242": {"Name": "Zenner D.", "AuthorID": "6505927242", "AffiliationID": "60159791, 60031259", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Postgraduate School of Medicine and Health, University of Central Lancashire"}, "57188672664": {"Name": "Loutet M.G.", "AuthorID": "57188672664", "AffiliationID": "60159791, 60031259", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Postgraduate School of Medicine and Health, University of Central Lancashire"}, "15073716700": {"Name": "Harris R.", "AuthorID": "15073716700", "AffiliationID": "60159791, 60031259", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Postgraduate School of Medicine and Health, University of Central Lancashire"}, "57202053073": {"Name": "Wilson S.", "AuthorID": "57202053073", "AffiliationID": "60159791, 60031259", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Postgraduate School of Medicine and Health, University of Central Lancashire"}, "7006391546": {"Name": "Ormerod L.P.", "AuthorID": "7006391546", "AffiliationID": "60159791, 60031259", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Postgraduate School of Medicine and Health, University of Central Lancashire"}}}
