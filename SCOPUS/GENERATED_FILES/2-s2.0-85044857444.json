However, they are also well known for their destructive effects on living organisms, leading to concerns about the adverse effects of laser technologies. To implement Raman spectroscopy for cell analysis and manipulation, such as Ramanactivated cell sorting, it is crucial to identify nondestructive conditions for living cells. Here, we evaluated quantitatively the effect of 532-nm laser irradiation on bacterial cell fate and growth at the single-cell level. Using a purpose-built microfluidic platform, we were able to quantify the growth characteristics, i.e., specific growth rates and lag times of individual cells, as well as the survival rate of a population in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy. Representative Gram-negative and Grampositive species show similar trends in response to a laser irradiation dose. Laser irradiation could compromise the physiological function of cells, and the degree of destruction is both dose and strain dependent, ranging from reduced cell growth to a complete loss of cell metabolic activity and finally to physical disintegration. Grampositive bacterial cells are more susceptible than Gram-negative bacterial strains to irradiation-induced damage. By directly correlating Raman acquisition with single-cell growth characteristics, we provide evidence of nondestructive characteristics of Raman spectroscopy on individual bacterial cells. However, while strong Raman signals can be obtained without causing cell death, the variety of responses from different strains and from individual cells justifies careful evaluation of Raman acquisition conditions if cell viability is critical.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Growth", "Laser", "Microfluidics", "Raman spectroscopy", "Raman-activated cell sorting", "Single cell", "Viability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell sorting", "Growth characteristic", "Microfluidic platforms", "Non-destructive conditions", "Physiological function of cells", "Single cells", "Specific growth rate", "Viability", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Positive Bacteria", "Lasers", "Microfluidics", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044857444", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"55699345200": {"Name": "Yuan X.", "AuthorID": "55699345200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "57191537222": {"Name": "Song Y.", "AuthorID": "57191537222", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7003822477": {"Name": "Glidle A.", "AuthorID": "7003822477", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "14630183300": {"Name": "Ijaz U.", "AuthorID": "14630183300", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7403113927": {"Name": "Yin H.", "AuthorID": "7403113927", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "15760918300": {"Name": "Song Y.", "AuthorID": "15760918300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "57194691999": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "57194691999", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "55116267300": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "55116267300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "34770611600": {"Name": "Huang W.", "AuthorID": "34770611600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "57203250221": {"Name": "Cusack M.", "AuthorID": "57203250221", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Stirling"}}}
