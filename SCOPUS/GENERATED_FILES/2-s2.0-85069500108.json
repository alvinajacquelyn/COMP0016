This cross-sectional study investigates whether the association between accelerometer-derived physical activity and lung function in older adults differs by smoking history. The sample comprised 3063 participants (age = 60\u201383 years) who wore an accelerometer during 9 days and undertook respiratory function tests. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; acceleration \u22650.1 g (gravity)) in smokers but not in never smokers: FVC differences for 10 min increase in MVPA were 58.6 (95% Confidence interval: 21.1, 96.1), 27.8 (4.9, 50.7), 16.6 (7.9, 25.4), 2.8 (\u22125.2, 10.7) ml in current, recent ex-, long-term ex-, and never-smokers, respectively. A similar trend was observed for forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Functional data analysis, a threshold-free approach using the entire accelerometry distribution, showed an association between physical activity and lung function in all smoking groups, with stronger association in current and recent ex-smokers than in long-term ex- and never-smokers; the associations were evident in never smokers only at activity levels above the conventional 0.1 g MVPA threshold. These findings suggest that the association between lung function and physical activity in older adults is more pronounced in smokers than non-smokers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Circadian Rhythm", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-Smokers", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Smokers", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069500108", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55481352900": {"Name": "Benadjaoud M.A.", "AuthorID": "55481352900", "AffiliationID": "60027331", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)"}, "55425766700": {"Name": "Menai M.", "AuthorID": "55425766700", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, CRESS, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24339408800": {"Name": "Sabia S.", "AuthorID": "24339408800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56904096900": {"Name": "van Hees V.T.", "AuthorID": "56904096900", "AffiliationID": "60159380", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands eScience Center"}, "35232005200": {"Name": "Zipunnikov V.", "AuthorID": "35232005200", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "8618297000": {"Name": "Regnaux J.P.", "AuthorID": "8618297000", "AffiliationID": "60107130", "AffiliationName": "EHESP, Center of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics - UMR 1153"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
