All Rights Reserved.Objective: Sepsis is life-Threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host responses to infection. Current knowledge of human B-cell alterations in sepsis is sparse. We tested the hypothesis that B-cell loss in sepsis involves distinct subpopulations of B cells and investigated mechanisms of B-cell depletion. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Critical care units. Patients: Adult sepsis patients without any documented immune comorbidity. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: B-cell subsets were quantified by flow cytometry; annexin-V status identified apoptotic cells and phosphorylation of intracellular kinases identified activation status of B-cell subsets. B cell-specific survival ligand concentrations were measured. Gene expression in purified B cells was measured by microarray. Differences in messenger RNA abundance between sepsis and healthy controls were compared. Lymphopenia present in 74.2% of patients on admission day was associated with lower absolute B-cell counts (median [interquartile range], 0.133 [0.093-0.277] 109 cells/L) and selective depletion of memory B cells despite normal B cell survival ligand concentrations. Greater apoptotic depletion of class-switched and IgM memory cells was associated with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, implying externally driven lymphocyte stress and activation-Associated cell death. This inference is supported by gene expression profiles highlighting mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death pathways, with enriched intrinsic and extrinsic pathway apoptosis genes. Conclusions: Depletion of the memory B-cell compartment contributes to the immunosuppression induced by sepsis. Therapies targeted at reversing this immune memory depletion warrant further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "B cells", "Immune memory", "Immunosuppression", "Sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Annexin A5", "Apoptosis", "B-Lymphocyte Subsets", "B-Lymphocytes", "Critical Illness", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Hospitals, University", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Lymphopenia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "RNA, Messenger", "Sepsis", "Tissue Array Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015240972", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"35365083600": {"Name": "Shankar-Hari M.", "AuthorID": "35365083600", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8054135300": {"Name": "Swanson C.", "AuthorID": "8054135300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Programme of Infection and Immunity, King's College London"}, "7402630514": {"Name": "Spencer J.", "AuthorID": "7402630514", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Programme of Infection and Immunity, King's College London"}, "6701364561": {"Name": "Fear D.", "AuthorID": "6701364561", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520, 60002517", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "57194440761": {"Name": "Lavender P.", "AuthorID": "57194440761", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520, 60002517", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "7006090217": {"Name": "Beale R.", "AuthorID": "7006090217", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56554264700": {"Name": "Mare T.", "AuthorID": "56554264700", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London"}}}
