However, the accuracy of such systems suffers from illumination changes, unpredictability, and variability in appearance (e.g. occluded faces or hands, cluttered backgrounds, etc.). This work evaluates different statistical and chrominance models in different environments with increasingly cluttered backgrounds where changes in lighting are common and with no occlusions applied, in order to get a reliable neural network reconstruction of faces and hands, without taking into account the structural and temporal kinematics of the hands. First a statistical model is used for skin colour segmentation to roughly locate hands and faces. Then a neural network is used to reconstruct in 3D the hands and faces. For the filtering and the reconstruction we have used the growing neural gas algorithm which can preserve the topology of an object without restarting the learning process. Experiments conducted on our own database but also on four benchmark databases (Stirling\u2019s, Alicante, Essex, and Stegmann\u2019s) and on deaf individuals from normal 2D videos are freely available on the BSL signbank dataset. Results demonstrate the validity of our system to solve problems of face and hand segmentation and reconstruction under different environmental conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colour models", "Expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm", "Self-organising networks", "Shape modelling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064241967", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"13605902500": {"Name": "Angelopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "13605902500", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Westminster"}, "6603546263": {"Name": "Kapetanios E.", "AuthorID": "6603546263", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Westminster"}, "57208262641": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "57208262641", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Westminster"}, "6603307034": {"Name": "Psarrou A.", "AuthorID": "6603307034", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Westminster"}, "35872525800": {"Name": "Garcia-Rodriguez J.", "AuthorID": "35872525800", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing Technology, University of Alicante"}, "53864128700": {"Name": "Orts-Escolano S.", "AuthorID": "53864128700", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing Technology, University of Alicante"}, "7004344871": {"Name": "Woll B.", "AuthorID": "7004344871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}}}
