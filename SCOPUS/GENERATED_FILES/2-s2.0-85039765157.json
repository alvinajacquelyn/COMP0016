The mechanisms by which such sociality evolved, as well as those underpinning the elaboration of ant societies since their \u223c140 million year old common ancestor, have long been pondered. Here, we review recent insights generated using various genomic approaches. This includes understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying caste differentiation and the diversity of social structures, studying the impact of eusociality on genomic evolutionary rates, and investigating gene expression changes associated with differences in lifespan between castes. Furthermore, functional studies involving RNAi and CRISPR have recently been successfully applied to ants, opening the door to exciting research that promises to revolutionize the understanding of the evolution and diversification of social living.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ants", "Behavior, Animal", "Gene Expression", "Genome, Insect", "Longevity", "Social Behavior", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039765157", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"56676193000": {"Name": "Favreau E.", "AuthorID": "56676193000", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Organismal Biology Department, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56414748700": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Ruiz C.", "AuthorID": "56414748700", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Organismal Biology Department, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57200116833": {"Name": "Rodrigues Santiago L.", "AuthorID": "57200116833", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Organismal Biology Department, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "15766615600": {"Name": "Wurm Y.", "AuthorID": "15766615600", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Organismal Biology Department, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57200908621": {"Name": "Hammond R.", "AuthorID": "57200908621", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester"}}}
