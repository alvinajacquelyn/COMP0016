A small range of terpenes (ocimene, myrcene, \u03b1-terpinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, isoprene, and farnesene) have been used as the base set for the library, with the first library derived from a Diels-Alder reaction with the platform chemical maleic anhydride. The second library requires the derivatization of the first through a hydrogenation reaction. The potential for scale-up of both libraries has been demonstrated, with the Diels-Alder process delivering 10.5 grams of the product in 3 hours and the hydrogenation process delivering 10 grams of the material in 16 hours.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous flows", "Derivatizations", "Diels-Alder", "Diels-Alder reaction", "Hydrogenation process", "Hydrogenation reactions", "Phellandrene", "Platform chemicals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061085162", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57038894000": {"Name": "Galaverna R.", "AuthorID": "57038894000", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas-UNICAMP"}, "57205683162": {"Name": "Fernandes L.", "AuthorID": "57205683162", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas-UNICAMP"}, "13406948400": {"Name": "Pastre J.", "AuthorID": "13406948400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas-UNICAMP"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}}}
