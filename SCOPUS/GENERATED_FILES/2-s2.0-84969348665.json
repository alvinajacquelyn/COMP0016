Klin and J. Rot.We use modal logic as a framework for coalgebraic trace semantics, and show the flexibility of the approach with concrete examples such as the language semantics of weighted, alternating and tree automata. We provide a sufficient condition under which a logical semantics coincides with the trace semantics obtained via a given determinization construction. Finally, we consider a condition that guarantees the existence of a canonical determinization procedure that is correct with respect to a given logical semantics. That procedure is closely related to Brzozowski\u2019s minimization algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coalgebra", "Trace semantics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coalgebraic trace semantics", "Coalgebras", "Determinization", "Language semantics", "Logical semantics", "Minimization algorithms", "Trace semantics", "Tree automata"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969348665", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56212007000": {"Name": "Klin B.", "AuthorID": "56212007000", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "University of Warsaw"}, "55305790900": {"Name": "Rot J.", "AuthorID": "55305790900", "AffiliationID": "120203406", "AffiliationName": "CWILeiden University"}}}
