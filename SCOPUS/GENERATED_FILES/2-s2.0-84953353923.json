Stock prices in the model occasionally display belief-driven boom and bust cycles that delink asset prices from fundamentals and redistribute considerable amounts of wealth from less to more experienced investors. Although gains from trade arise only from subjective belief differences, introducing financial transactions taxes (FTTs) remains undesirable. While FTTs reduce the size and length of boom-bust cycles, they increase the likelihood of such cycles, thereby overall return volatility and wealth redistribution. Contingent FTTs, which are levied only above a certain price threshold, give rise to problems of equilibrium multiplicity and non-existence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asset price booms", "Financial transactions tax", "Tobin tax"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953353923", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56214762600": {"Name": "Adam K.", "AuthorID": "56214762600", "AffiliationID": "60016621", "AffiliationName": "CEPR"}, "57014967000": {"Name": "Beutel J.", "AuthorID": "57014967000", "AffiliationID": "60006341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Mannheim"}, "57014726100": {"Name": "Merkel S.", "AuthorID": "57014726100", "AffiliationID": "60006341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Mannheim"}, "6505918685": {"Name": "Marcet A.", "AuthorID": "6505918685", "AffiliationID": "60105207, 60017553, 60032907, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'An\u00e0lisi Econ\u00f2mica (CSIC), ICREA, UAB, MOVE"}}}
