Pangolins are the most heavily trafficked mammals across illegal wildlife trade globally, but critically endangered Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) have not been widely studied in insular Southeast Asia. We used > 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) to assign pangolin seizures from illegal trade of unknown origin to possible geographic sources via genetic clustering with pangolins of known origin. Our SNPs reveal three previously unrecognized genetic lineages of Sunda pangolins, possibly from Borneo, Java and Singapore/Sumatra. The seizure assignments suggest the majority of pangolins were traded from Borneo to Java. Using mitochondrial markers did not provide the same resolution of pangolin lineages, and to explore if admixture might explain these differences, we applied sophisticated tests of introgression using > 2000 SNPs to investigate secondary gene flow between each of the three Sunda pangolin lineages. It is possible the admixture which we discovered is due to human-mediated movements of pangolins. Our findings impact a range of conservation actions, including tracing patterns of trade, repatriation of rescue animals, and conservation breeding. In order to conserve genetic diversity, we suggest that, pending further research, each pangolin lineage should as a precaution be protected and managed as an evolutionarily distinct conservation unit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conservation breeding", "Gene flow", "Illegal wildlife trade", "Mitochondrial markers", "Population assignment", "SNPs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047945518", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57147052700": {"Name": "Nash H.", "AuthorID": "57147052700", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore"}, "57195331294": {"Name": "Low G.", "AuthorID": "57195331294", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore"}, "7401454306": {"Name": "Evans T.", "AuthorID": "7401454306", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, The University of Western Australia (M092)"}, "8715404300": {"Name": "Rheindt F.", "AuthorID": "8715404300", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore"}, "36704258500": {"Name": "Wirdateti", "AuthorID": "36704258500", "AffiliationID": "60069394", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Biology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI)"}, "6603359394": {"Name": "Semiadi G.", "AuthorID": "6603359394", "AffiliationID": "60069394", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Biology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI)"}, "56673012200": {"Name": "Choo S.", "AuthorID": "56673012200", "AffiliationID": "60102426", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Genome Centre (SGC), Health Technologies University Research Centre (HT-URC), Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"}, "55670864700": {"Name": "Hari R.", "AuthorID": "55670864700", "AffiliationID": "60106654", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bioinformatics, School of Data Sciences, Perdana University"}, "57201290177": {"Name": "Chong J.", "AuthorID": "57201290177", "AffiliationID": "60078085", "AffiliationName": "School of Marine & Environmental Sciences and the Institute of Tropical Biodiversity & Sustainable Development, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu"}, "55914252600": {"Name": "Sulaiman M.", "AuthorID": "55914252600", "AffiliationID": "60078085", "AffiliationName": "School of Marine & Environmental Sciences and the Institute of Tropical Biodiversity & Sustainable Development, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu"}, "8608216100": {"Name": "Turvey S.", "AuthorID": "8608216100", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London, Institute of Zoology"}}}
