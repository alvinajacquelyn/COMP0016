However, although DCM patients do not recover and slowly deteriorate further, PPCM patients show either a fast cardiac deterioration or complete recovery. The aim of this study was to assess if underlying cellular changes can explain the clinical similarities and differences in the two diseases. We, therefore, assessed sarcomeric protein expression, modification, titin isoform shift, and contractile behavior of cardiomyocytes in heart tissue of PPCM and DCM patients and compared these with nonfailing controls. Heart samples from ischemic heart disease (ISHD) patients served as heart failure control samples. Passive force was only increased in PPCM samples compared with controls, whereas PPCM, DCM, and ISHD samples all showed increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Length-dependent activation was significantly impaired in PPCM compared with controls, no impairment was observed in ISHD samples, and DCM samples showed an intermediate response. Contractile impairments were caused by impaired protein kinase A (PKA)\u2013mediated phosphorylation because exogenous PKA restored all parameters to control levels. Although DCM samples showed reexpression of EH-myomesin, an isoform usually only expressed in the heart before birth, PPCM and ISHD did not. The lack of EH-myomesin, combined with low PKA-mediated phosphorylation of myofilament proteins and increased compliant titin isoform, may explain the increase in passive force and blunted length-dependent activation of myofilaments in PPCM samples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cardiomyopathies", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Myofibrils", "Peripartum Period", "Pregnancy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034239135", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"55885479900": {"Name": "Bollen I.A.E.", "AuthorID": "55885479900", "AffiliationID": "118664145", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences"}, "57197736080": {"Name": "Bouwman F.", "AuthorID": "57197736080", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "57197730002": {"Name": "Kempers L.", "AuthorID": "57197730002", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "26635445400": {"Name": "Kuster D.W.D.", "AuthorID": "26635445400", "AffiliationID": "118664145", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences"}, "7005148416": {"Name": "van der Velden J.", "AuthorID": "7005148416", "AffiliationID": "118230784", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "23475660000": {"Name": "van Spaendonck-Zwarts K.Y.", "AuthorID": "23475660000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam"}, "7005881276": {"Name": "Pinto Y.M.", "AuthorID": "7005881276", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Medical Center Heart Center, Department of Clinical and Experimental Cardiology, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam"}, "7007082619": {"Name": "Ehler E.", "AuthorID": "7007082619", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics and Cardiovascular Division, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King's College London"}, "57197728139": {"Name": "Fleischanderl K.", "AuthorID": "57197728139", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics and Cardiovascular Division, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King's College London"}, "55675861200": {"Name": "Ricke-Hoch M.", "AuthorID": "55675861200", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School"}, "6602676885": {"Name": "Hilfiker-Kleiner D.", "AuthorID": "6602676885", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School"}, "56033158200": {"Name": "dos Remedios C.G.", "AuthorID": "56033158200", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Bosch Institute, Discipline of Anatomy and Histology, University of Sydney"}, "57210969550": {"Name": "Kr\u00fcger M.", "AuthorID": "57210969550", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Physiology, Heinrich-Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "7005881225": {"Name": "Vink A.", "AuthorID": "7005881225", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.W.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}}}
