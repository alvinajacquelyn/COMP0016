Methods Here, we describe two apparently unrelated cases of p.A53T (G209A) SNCA mutation carriers with an atypical initial manifestation and disease course. Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau, p-tau and amyloid A\u03b242 were measured in these patients and in an additional cohort of 5 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic p.A53T carriers without an initial manifestation of dementia. Results Both patients exhibited an early onset frontal-dysexecutive dysfunction with apathy and emotional blunting resembling frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Motor symptoms typical of Parkinson's disease appeared only later in the disease course and were less prominent than cognitive ones, which included language impairment. Autonomic dysfunction and myoclonus also emerged in a more advanced disease stage. In both patients, Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy, and CSF analysis showed elevated tau protein levels. In contrast, tau protein levels were normal in a cohort of 7 other p.A53T mutation carriers (5 symptomatic/2 asymptomatic). A screen of Greek patients presenting with frontotemporal dementia failed to identify any additional subjects with the p.A53T SNCA mutation. Conclusion Although cognitive decline has been recognized as a feature of the full-blown clinical picture of p.A53T related parkinsonism, a predominant frontotemporal dementia-like phenotype at presentation has not been previously described. This may represent a subtype of this disorder, with distinctive clinical, imaging and CSF biochemical characteristics, in which additional genetic or epigenetic factors may play a role.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha-synuclein", "Dysexecutive syndrome", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Parkinson's disease", "Tau protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "alpha-Synuclein", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010825416", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55629725400": {"Name": "Bougea A.", "AuthorID": "55629725400", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56507457500": {"Name": "Bourbouli M.", "AuthorID": "56507457500", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6701539777": {"Name": "Kapaki E.", "AuthorID": "6701539777", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6701365777": {"Name": "Paraskevas G.", "AuthorID": "6701365777", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps University"}, "56575103000": {"Name": "Simitsi A.", "AuthorID": "56575103000", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "42261006800": {"Name": "Antonelou R.", "AuthorID": "42261006800", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56105185000": {"Name": "Tasios K.", "AuthorID": "56105185000", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57190171797": {"Name": "Fragkiadaki S.", "AuthorID": "57190171797", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15770367100": {"Name": "Papageorgiou S.", "AuthorID": "15770367100", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "56430631100": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "56430631100", "AffiliationID": "100403312", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Clinic, Henry Dunan Hospital"}, "57213455761": {"Name": "Geronicola Trapali X.", "AuthorID": "57213455761", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Unit, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56845115700": {"Name": "Breza M.", "AuthorID": "56845115700", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "8582714300": {"Name": "Koutsis G.", "AuthorID": "8582714300", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}}}
