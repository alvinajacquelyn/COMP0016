Pore pressure is one of the main triggering factors in heat-induced explosive spalling (relevant for structures, such as tunnels, exposed to fire), while moisture migration influences concrete radiation shielding capability (important in containment shells of nuclear power plants and radioactive waste repositories). Hence, the experimental monitoring of water front in concrete at high temperature is a very interesting \u2013 though challenging \u2013 task. In a recent experimental campaign carried out at Politecnico di Milano, promising results have been obtained by coupling pore pressure-temperature measurements and water front monitoring through Ground-Penetrating Radar. This technique was implemented in a fire test performed on a concrete slab heated at the bottom face and proved to be effective in detecting the position of the water front during heating. The combination with pressure measurement allowed to confirm that pressure peaks are achieved in correspondence of the water front.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concrete", "Drying", "Fire", "Ground-Penetrating Radar", "High temperature", "Pore pressure", "Spalling", "Vaporization", "Water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concrete at high temperatures", "Experimental campaign", "Explosive spalling", "Ground Penetrating Radar", "High temperature", "Radioactive waste repository", "Shielding capability", "Water vaporization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021437790", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"36461562900": {"Name": "Lo Monte F.", "AuthorID": "36461562900", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6601910236": {"Name": "Felicetti R.", "AuthorID": "6601910236", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6701399330": {"Name": "Lualdi M.", "AuthorID": "6701399330", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "56373070600": {"Name": "Lombardi F.", "AuthorID": "56373070600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College of London"}}}
