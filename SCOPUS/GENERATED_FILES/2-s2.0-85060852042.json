We generate synthetic spectra for a wide range of parameters, and show that the line-width results are consistent with extensive measurements of O stars that are either single or are members of 'normal' binaries. By contrast, the WR+O results are at the extremes of, or outside, the distributions of bothmodels and other observations. Remeasurement of theWR+O spectra shows that they can be reconciled with other results by judicious choice of pseudocontinuum normalization. With this interpretation, the supersynchronous rotation previously noted for the O-star components in the WR+O binaries with the longest orbital periods appears to be unexceptional. Our investigation is therefore consistent with the aphorism that if the title of a paper ends with a question mark, the answer is probably 'no'.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binaries: spectroscopic", "Stars: early-type", "Stars: rotation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060852042", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57168733300": {"Name": "Reeve D.", "AuthorID": "57168733300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004055028": {"Name": "Howarth I.", "AuthorID": "7004055028", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
