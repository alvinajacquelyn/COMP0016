Despite being able to identify these irrational actions from an early age, humans display a curious tendency to copy them. The current study recorded participants\u2019 movements during an established imitation task and manipulated the rationality of the observed action in two ways. Participants observed videos of a model point to a series of targets with either a low, high or \u2018superhigh\u2019 trajectory either in the presence or absence of obstacles between her targets. The participants\u2019 task was to watch which targets the model pointed to and then point to the same targets on the table in front of them. There were no obstacles between the participants\u2019 targets. Firstly, we found that the peak height of participants\u2019 movements between their targets was sensitive to the height of the model\u2019s movements, even in the \u2018superhigh\u2019 condition where the model\u2019s action was rated as irrational. Secondly, participants showed obstacle priming\u2014the peak height of participants\u2019 movements was higher after having observed the model move over obstacles to reach her targets, compared to when there were no obstacles between her targets. This suggests that participants code the environment of co-actors into their own motor programs, even when this compromises the efficiency of their own movements. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of theories of imitation and obstacle priming.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imitation", "Motor contagion", "Obstacle priming", "Perception\u2013action coupling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Psychomotor Performance", "Space Perception", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020513783", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57164501700": {"Name": "Forbes P.A.G.", "AuthorID": "57164501700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.F.d.C.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
