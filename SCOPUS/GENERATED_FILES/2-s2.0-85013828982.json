These aspirated gas mixtures were pilot-ignited by diesel fuel, while the engine load was varied between 0 and 7 bar IMEP by only adjusting the flow rate of the aspirated mixtures. The in-cylinder gas composition was also investigated when combusting CH4-CO2and CH4-CO2-H2mixtures at different engine loads, with in-cylinder samples collected using two different sampling arrangements. The results showed a longer ignition delay period and lower peak heat release rates when the proportion of CO2was increased in the aspirated mixture. Exhaust CO2emissions were observed to be higher for 60CH4:40CO2mixture, but lower for the 80CH4:20CO2mixture as compared to diesel fuel only combustion at all engine loads. Both exhaust and in-cylinder NOx levels were observed to decrease when the proportion of CO2was increased; NOx levels increased when the proportion of H2was increased in the aspirated mixture. In-cylinder NOx levels were observed to be higher in the region between the sprays as compared to within the spray core, attributable to higher gas temperatures reached, post ignition, in that region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biogas", "Co-combustion", "Diesel engine", "Exhaust emissions", "Hydrogen", "In-cylinder sampling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cocombustion", "Direct injection diesel engines", "Emission characteristics", "Exhaust emission", "Higher gas temperature", "In-cylinder sampling", "Naturally aspirated", "Peak heat release rates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013828982", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55745306300": {"Name": "Talibi M.", "AuthorID": "55745306300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55174359600": {"Name": "Hellier P.", "AuthorID": "55174359600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003607190": {"Name": "Ladommatos N.", "AuthorID": "7003607190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
