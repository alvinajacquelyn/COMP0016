Objective: To determine the correlation of NFL in CSF and serum/plasma, and in plasma after switching from injectable MS therapies to fingolimod. Methods: A first cohort consisted of MS patients (n = 39) and neurological disease controls (n = 27) where CSF and plasma/serum had been collected for diagnostic purposes. A second cohort (n = 243) consisted of patients from a post-marketing study of fingolimod. NFL was determined with Single Molecule Array (Simoa\u2122) technology (detection threshold 1.95 pg/mL). Results: Mean NFL pg/mL (standard deviation (SD)) was 341 (267) and 1475 (2358) in CSF and 8.2 (3.58) and 17.0 (16.94) in serum from controls and MS, respectively. CSF/serum and plasma/serum levels were highly correlated (n = 66, rho = 0.672, p < 0.0001 and n = 16, rho = 0.684, p = 0.009, respectively). In patients starting fingolimod (n = 243), mean NFL pg/mL (SD) in plasma was reduced between baseline (20.4 (10.7)) and at 12 months (13.5 (7.3), p < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126), and levels remained stable at 24 months (13.2 (6.2)). Conclusion: NFL in serum and CSF are highly correlated and plasma NFL levels decrease after switching to highly effective MS therapy. Blood NFL measurement can be considered as a biomarker for MS therapy response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beta-interferon", "drug response biomarkers", "fingolimod", "glatiramer acetate", "Multiple sclerosis", "neurofilament"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032871253", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7004836264": {"Name": "Piehl F.", "AuthorID": "7004836264", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna"}, "7003874276": {"Name": "Kockum I.", "AuthorID": "7003874276", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna"}, "57208893322": {"Name": "Khademi M.", "AuthorID": "57208893322", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna"}, "55550356500": {"Name": "Olsson T.", "AuthorID": "55550356500", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57205654889": {"Name": "Lycke J.", "AuthorID": "57205654889", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
