The present study sought to extend research on PRF by examining aspects of the construct that are still scarcely explored, such as the role of gender and attachment; to investigate whether there were differences between mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 PRF and whether there were differences in PRF related to the gender and age of the child; and, finally, to assess the association between PRF and each parent\u2019s attachment style. The Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) were administered to a community sample of mothers and fathers of 385 children aged 3\u201310 years. A multi-group factor analysis supported the hypothesized three-factor model among both fathers and mothers. Univariate and multivariate analyses of variance showed that mothers had higher levels of interest and curiosity in their children\u2019s mental states than fathers. Parents of daughters showed higher pre-mentalizing modes than parents of sons. Parents of preschool children showed less nonmentalizing modes than parents of children aged 8\u201310. Correlations between PRFQ and ASQ showed that both mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 interest in thinking about their child\u2019s internal experience and in taking the child\u2019s perspective were correlated with higher levels of secure attachment style.
