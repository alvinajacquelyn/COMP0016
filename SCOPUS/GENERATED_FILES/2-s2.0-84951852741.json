We present GapsMis, an algorithm for pairwise global sequence alignment with a variable, but bounded, number of gaps. It is based on computing a variant of the traditional dynamic programming matrix for global sequence alignment. We also present GapsMis-L, the analogous algorithm for pairwise local sequence alignment with a variable, but bounded, number of gaps.To test the accuracy of GapsMis and GapsMis-L we performed millions of pairwise sequence alignments under realistic conditions, based on the properties of real full-length genomes. The results show that GapsMis and GapsMis-L can increase the accuracy of extending short-read alignments compared to the traditional approaches. The importance of our contribution is underlined by the fact that the provided algorithms may be seamlessly integrated into any biological pipeline.
