The purpose of this study was to determine: (i) the component structure of these measures in FEP (primary analyses), and (ii) the dependence of any findings in these primary analyses on variations in analytic methods. Symptom ratings were exposed to data reduction methods and the effects of the following manipulations ascertained: (i) level of analysis (individual symptom vs. global symptom severity ratings), (ii) extraction method (principal component vs. exploratory factor analysis) and (iii) retention method (scree test vs. Kaiser criterion). Whilst global ratings level analysis rendered the classic triad of psychotic syndromes (positive, negative and disorganisation), symptom level analyses revealed a hierarchical structure, with 11 first-order components subsumed by three second-order components, which also mapped on to this syndrome triad. These results were robust across data reduction but not component retention methods, suggesting that discrepancies in the literature regarding the component structure of the SAPS/SANS partly reflect the level of analysis and component retention method used. Further, they support a hierarchical symptom model, the implications of which are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disorganisation symptoms", "Factor analysis", "Factor structure", "Negative symptoms", "Positive symptoms", "Psychosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychometrics", "Psychotic Disorders", "Symptom Assessment", "Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056202109", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"10143727100": {"Name": "Tibber M.S.", "AuthorID": "10143727100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, UCL"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "23090615200": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "23090615200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "7006398244": {"Name": "Joyce E.M.", "AuthorID": "7006398244", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6506846879": {"Name": "Mutsatsa S.", "AuthorID": "6506846879", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "14524043100": {"Name": "Barnes T.R.E.", "AuthorID": "14524043100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}, "7801668191": {"Name": "Huddy V.", "AuthorID": "7801668191", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychology Unit, Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield"}}}
