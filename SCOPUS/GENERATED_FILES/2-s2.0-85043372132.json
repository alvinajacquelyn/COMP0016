All rights reserved.Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex produces a series of descending volleys known as D (direct) and I (indirect) waves. In the present study, we questioned whether spinal H-reflexes can be used to dissect D waves and early and late I waves from TMS. We therefore probed H-reflex facilitation at arrival times of D and I waves at the spinal level and thereby changed TMS parameters that have previously been shown to have selective effects on evoked D and different I waves. We changed TMS intensity and current direction and applied a double-pulse paradigm known as short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Experiments were conducted in flexor carpi radialis (FCR) in the arm and soleus (SOL) in the leg. There were two major findings: 1) in FCR, H-reflex facilitation showed characteristic modulations with altered TMS parameters that correspond to the changes of evoked D and I waves; and 2) H-reflexes in SOL did not, possibly because of increased interference from other spinal circuits. Therefore, the most significant outcome of this study is that in FCR, H-reflexes combined with TMS seem to be a useful technique to dissect TMS-induced D and I waves. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Questions that relate to corticospinal function in pathophysiology and movement control demand sophisticated techniques to provide information about corticospinal mechanisms. We introduce a noninvasive electrophysiological technique that may be useful in describing such mechanisms in more detail by dissecting D and I waves from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Based on the combination of spinal H-reflexes and TMS in the flexor carpi radialis muscle, the technique was shown to measure selective effects on D and I waves from changing TMS parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Motor cortex", "Spinal H-reflex", "TMS", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Electromyography", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "H-Reflex", "Humans", "Motor Cortex", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Neural Pathways", "Pyramidal Tracts", "Spinal Cord", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043372132", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"57201096897": {"Name": "Niemann N.", "AuthorID": "57201096897", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Bernstein Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "56845573100": {"Name": "Wiegel P.", "AuthorID": "56845573100", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Bernstein Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "57201090593": {"Name": "Kurz A.", "AuthorID": "57201090593", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Bernstein Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "23980441900": {"Name": "Leukel C.", "AuthorID": "23980441900", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS), University of Freiburg"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}}}
