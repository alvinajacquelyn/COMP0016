We demonstrate a novel joint estimation method suitable for spectrally efficient Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), based on the cyclostationary property of linearly modulated signals, exploited both in the frequency and time domains. Using a Nyquist superchannel composed of three 10 GBaud channels, we experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous monitoring of symbol-rate with 100% accuracy, roll-off, frequency offset (FO), chromatic dispersion (CD) and optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 20%, 4 MHz, 200 ps/nm and 1.5 dB respectively, when the roll-off factor is larger than 0.06 for DP-QPSK and 0.3 for DP-16QAM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Channel impairment", "Channel parameter", "Cyclostationary properties", "Frequency and time domains", "Linearly modulated signals", "Optical signal to noise ratio", "Root mean square errors", "Simultaneous monitoring"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943782353", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36703872700": {"Name": "Ionescu M.", "AuthorID": "36703872700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "55626583400": {"Name": "Sato M.", "AuthorID": "55626583400", "AffiliationID": "60031293", "AffiliationName": "NEC Corporation"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
