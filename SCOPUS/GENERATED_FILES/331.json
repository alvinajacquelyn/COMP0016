All rights reserved.We prove the existence of the flow by curvature of regular planar networks starting from an initial network which is non-regular. The proof relies on a monotonicity formula for expanding solutions and a local regularity result for the network flow in the spirit of B. White's local regularity theorem for mean curvature flow. We also show a pseudolocality theorem for mean curvature flow in any codimension, assuming only that the initial submanifold can be locally written as a graph with sufficiently small Lipschitz constant.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060691557", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"6506008595": {"Name": "Ilmanen T.", "AuthorID": "6506008595", "AffiliationID": "109228623", "AffiliationName": "Departement Mathematik"}, "36171218900": {"Name": "Neves A.", "AuthorID": "36171218900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Huxley Building"}, "16246400900": {"Name": "Schulze F.", "AuthorID": "16246400900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
