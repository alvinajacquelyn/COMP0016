All rights reserved.Cyclic monoterpenes are a group of phytochemicals with antinociceptive, local anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory actions. Effects of cyclic monoterpenes including vanilin, pulegone, eugenole, carvone, carvacrol, carveol, thymol, thymoquinone, menthone, and limonene were investigated on the functional properties of the cloned \u03b17 subunit of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Monoterpenes inhibited the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the order carveol>thymoquinone>carvacrol>menthone>thymol>limonene>eugenole>pulegone\u2265carvone\u2265vanilin. Among the monoterpenes, carveol showed the highest potency on acetylcholine-induced responses, with IC50 of 8.3 \u03bcM. Carveol-induced inhibition was independent of the membrane potential and could not be reversed by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine. In line with functional experiments, docking studies indicated that cyclic monoterpenes such as carveol may interact with an allosteric site located in the \u03b17 transmembrane domain. Our results indicate that cyclic monoterpenes inhibit the function of human \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with varying potencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carveol", "Monoterpenes", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "Xenopus oocyte"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor", "Animals", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Female", "Humans", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Monoterpenes", "Oocytes", "Protein Domains", "Time Factors", "Xenopus laevis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960800028", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56638582500": {"Name": "Lozon Y.", "AuthorID": "56638582500", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Functional Lipidomics, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "56637836400": {"Name": "Sultan A.", "AuthorID": "56637836400", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Functional Lipidomics, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "6506106217": {"Name": "Sadek B.", "AuthorID": "6506106217", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Functional Lipidomics, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "7102364390": {"Name": "Oz M.", "AuthorID": "7102364390", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Functional Lipidomics, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "6602656620": {"Name": "Lansdell S.", "AuthorID": "6602656620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006347978": {"Name": "Millar N.", "AuthorID": "7006347978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6506565345": {"Name": "Prytkova T.", "AuthorID": "6506565345", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Physiology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "36141397300": {"Name": "Yang K.", "AuthorID": "36141397300", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Physiology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "35553143200": {"Name": "Howarth F.", "AuthorID": "35553143200", "AffiliationID": "60016569", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University"}}}
