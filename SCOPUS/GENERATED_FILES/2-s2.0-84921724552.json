Here we show that a striking phenotype of mice with selective p110\u03b2 deletion in the megakaryocyte lineage is thrombus instability at a high shear rate, which is an effect that is not detected in the absence of p110\u03b1 in platelets. The high shear rate-dependent thrombus instability in the absence of p110\u03b2 is observed both ex vivo and in vivo with the formation of platelet emboli. Moreover, PI3K\u03b2 is required for the recruitment of new platelets to a growing thrombus when a pathological high shear is applied. Treatment of human blood with AZD6482, a selective PI3K\u03b2 inhibitor, phenocopies p110\u03b2 deletion in mouse platelets, which highlights the role of the kinase activity of p110\u03b2. Within the growing platelet thrombus, p110\u03b2 inactivation impairs the activating phosphorylations of Akt and the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3. In accord with these data, pharmacologic inhibition of GSK3 restores thrombus stability. Thus, platelet PI3K\u03b2 is not essential for thrombus growth and stability at normal arterial shear but has a specific and critical role in maintaining the integrity of the formed thrombus on elevation of shear rate, suggesting a potential risk of embolization on treatment with PI3K\u03b2 inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blood Platelets", "Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3", "Humans", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "ortho-Aminobenzoates", "Phosphorylation", "Platelet Aggregation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Pyridines", "Pyrimidines", "Pyrimidinones", "Stress, Mechanical", "Thrombosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921724552", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"14822187000": {"Name": "Laurent P.A.", "AuthorID": "14822187000", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60008905, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1048 and Universit\u00e9 Toulouse III, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire-Rangueil"}, "22986469100": {"Name": "S\u00e9verin S.", "AuthorID": "22986469100", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60008905, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1048 and Universit\u00e9 Toulouse III, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire-Rangueil"}, "7006423284": {"Name": "Payrastre B.", "AuthorID": "7006423284", "AffiliationID": "60122693", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1048, I2MC"}, "6603132134": {"Name": "Gratacap M.P.", "AuthorID": "6603132134", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60008905, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1048 and Universit\u00e9 Toulouse III, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire-Rangueil"}, "6603743793": {"Name": "Hechler B.", "AuthorID": "6603743793", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60000905, 60046714", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche-S949, INSERM-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, \u00c9tablissement Franc\u00b8ais du Sang-Alsace"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Signalling, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
