Taking England as a focal point, it problematizes the use of the term \u2018quality\u2019 and attempts to standardise its meaning; highlighting the disconnect that exists between policy and practice. The paper combines discourse analysis of a small number of key government documents with a series of interviews with early years stakeholders in order to identify issues that will have resonance and can inform a much needed continuation of debates about what quality might mean. Over the course of the research it became apparent that there was considerable disquiet amongst early years practitioners with regards the current qualifications and training landscape, particularly with regards to what many viewed as ideologically-driven policy-making, not informed by proper dialogue with the sector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early years", "professionalisation", "qualifications", "Quality", "standards"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038366368", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57193603792": {"Name": "Elwick A.", "AuthorID": "57193603792", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Research and Scholarship (CERS), Middlesex University"}, "16029612200": {"Name": "Osgood J.", "AuthorID": "16029612200", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Research and Scholarship (CERS), Middlesex University"}, "12646047300": {"Name": "Robertson L.", "AuthorID": "12646047300", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Research and Scholarship (CERS), Middlesex University"}, "55002808400": {"Name": "Sakr M.", "AuthorID": "55002808400", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Research and Scholarship (CERS), Middlesex University"}, "57199689454": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "57199689454", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Research and Scholarship (CERS), Middlesex University"}}}
