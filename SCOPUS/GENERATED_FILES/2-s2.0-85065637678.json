Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Horizontal transmission of rotavirus vaccine virus may contribute to indirect effects of rotavirus vaccine, but data are lacking from low-income countries. Serial stool samples were obtained from Malawian infants who received 2 doses of monovalent human rotavirus vaccine (RV1) (days 4, 6, 8, and 10 after vaccination) and from their household contacts (8-10 days after vaccine). RV1 vaccine virus in stool was detected using semi-quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RV1 fecal shedding was detected in 41 of 60 vaccinated infants (68%) and in 2 of 147 household contacts (1.4%). Horizontal transmission of vaccine virus within households is unlikely to make a major contribution to RV1 indirect effects in Malawi.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Indirect effects", "Malawi", "Rotavirus", "Transmission", "Vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Family Characteristics", "Feces", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Malawi", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Rotavirus", "Rotavirus Infections", "Rotavirus Vaccines", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065637678", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56643932100": {"Name": "Bennett A.", "AuthorID": "56643932100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Vaccine Research, Institute of Infection and Global Health"}, "55651785900": {"Name": "Pollock L.", "AuthorID": "55651785900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Vaccine Research, Institute of Infection and Global Health"}, "24724753300": {"Name": "Jere K.C.", "AuthorID": "24724753300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Vaccine Research, Institute of Infection and Global Health"}, "19933714900": {"Name": "Everett D.", "AuthorID": "19933714900", "AffiliationID": "60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "8372787000": {"Name": "Bar-Zeev N.", "AuthorID": "8372787000", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "7003269879": {"Name": "Cunliffe N.A.", "AuthorID": "7003269879", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Vaccine Research, Institute of Infection and Global Health"}, "55663205600": {"Name": "Iturriza-Gomara M.", "AuthorID": "55663205600", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections, University of Liverpool"}, "34572310000": {"Name": "Pitzer V.E.", "AuthorID": "34572310000", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University"}, "6701349763": {"Name": "Lopman B.", "AuthorID": "6701349763", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "7006315208": {"Name": "Parashar U.", "AuthorID": "7006315208", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}}
