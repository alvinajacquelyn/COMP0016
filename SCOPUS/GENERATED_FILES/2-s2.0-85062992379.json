No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Background Early diagnosis strategies and advances in retinoblastoma (Rb) management have resulted in nearly 100%survival. More attention should, therefore, be given to quality of life considerations. We aimed to quantify the number of examinations under anaesthesia (EUAs) in a cohort of patients with Rb, as a measure of disease burden. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients with unilateral Rb that presented to the London Rb service from 2006 to 2013, were treated and had long-term follow-up. Correlations of clinical variables to number of EUAs were investigated. Results A total of 107 patients with Rb were included that presented at a mean age of 26.51 \u00b1 22.68 months. The International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (IIRC) was group B in 5 (5%), C in 13 (12%), D in 48 (45%) and E in 41 (38%) of the cases. Primary treatment was intravenous chemotherapy in 36 (34%) and enucleation in 71 (66%) of the cases. Mean number of EUAs was 20.67 \u00b1 6.62, 12.52 \u00b1 6.23 and 11.15 \u00b1 6.91 for combined groups B/C, group D and group E patients (p < 0.001), respectively. On analysis, early age atpresentation and conservative treatments were found to significantly correlate with increased number of EUAs (p < 0.001). Mean follow-up time was 74.42 \u00b1 25.16 months and no metastasis or death were reported. Conclusion Families should be counselled regarding the number of EUAs associated with the patient's IIRC group, with B/C eyes undergoing twice the number as compared with D/E eyes. For group D cases, where both enucleation and conservative therapy are valid options, treatment choice has a significant impact on the number of EUAs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["neoplasia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Anesthesia, General", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Child, Preschool", "Eye Enucleation", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Infusions, Intra-Arterial", "London", "Male", "Retinal Neoplasms", "Retinoblastoma", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062992379", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35310047800": {"Name": "Fabian I.D.", "AuthorID": "35310047800", "AffiliationID": "60005681, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University"}, "57207825196": {"Name": "Shah V.", "AuthorID": "57207825196", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402242349": {"Name": "Reddy M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402242349", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Retinoblastoma Service, Royal London Hospital"}, "57194380626": {"Name": "Naeem Z.", "AuthorID": "57194380626", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Retinoblastoma Service, Royal London Hospital"}, "6601959379": {"Name": "Onadim Z.", "AuthorID": "6601959379", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Retinoblastoma Service, Royal London Hospital"}, "57198238590": {"Name": "Price E.", "AuthorID": "57198238590", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Retinoblastoma Service, Royal London Hospital"}, "57113174400": {"Name": "Chowdhury T.", "AuthorID": "57113174400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57193552326": {"Name": "Duncan C.", "AuthorID": "57193552326", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at University CollegeLondon, Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57204445578": {"Name": "Kapelushnik N.", "AuthorID": "57204445578", "AffiliationID": "60005681, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University"}, "8619738500": {"Name": "Stansfield D.", "AuthorID": "8619738500", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthetic Department, Royal London Hospital"}}}
