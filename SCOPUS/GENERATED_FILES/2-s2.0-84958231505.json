However, prediction of secondary events after initial events of coronary artery disease (CAD) poses a new challenge. In a cohort of coronary angiography patients (n=1760), we examined readily available hematological parameters from the UPOD (Utrecht Patient Oriented Database) and their addition to prediction of secondary cardiovascular events. Backward stepwise multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test their ability to predict death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) measures were calculated for the hematological parameters on top of traditional risk factors to assess prediction improvement. Panels of 3 to 8 hematological parameters significantly improved prediction of death and adverse events. The IDIs ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 (all P<0.001) among outcome measures and the cNRIs from 0.11 to 0.40 (P<0.001 in 5 of 6 outcome measures). In the hematological panels red cell distribution width (RDW) appeared most often. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of RDW per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase for MACE was 1.19 [1.08-1.32], P<0.001. Routinely measured hematological parameters significantly improved prediction of mortality and adverse events in coronary angiography patients. Accurately indicating high-risk patients is of paramount importance in clinical decision-making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiovascular Agents", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Hematologic Tests", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958231505", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55879300600": {"Name": "Gijsberts C.", "AuthorID": "55879300600", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "14071039800": {"Name": "Den Ruijter H.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "7003654548": {"Name": "De Kleijn D.", "AuthorID": "7003654548", "AffiliationID": "116351043", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cardiology Laboratory, University Medical Center Utrecht, Department of Surgery"}, "7004573949": {"Name": "Pasterkamp G.", "AuthorID": "7004573949", "AffiliationID": "116351043", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cardiology Laboratory, University Medical Center Utrecht, Department of Surgery"}, "6602179811": {"Name": "Hoefer I.", "AuthorID": "6602179811", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "8980805700": {"Name": "Huisman A.", "AuthorID": "8980805700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "14058999300": {"Name": "Ten Berg M.", "AuthorID": "14058999300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7101779610": {"Name": "Van Wijk R.", "AuthorID": "7101779610", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57202970292": {"Name": "Van Solinge W.", "AuthorID": "57202970292", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7006736234": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "7006736234", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "Durrer Center for Cardiogenetic Research, ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "7004042874": {"Name": "Voskuil M.", "AuthorID": "7004042874", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "Durrer Center for Cardiogenetic Research, ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}}}
