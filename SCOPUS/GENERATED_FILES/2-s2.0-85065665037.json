Methods This is a prospective population-based study among community-dwelling individuals aged 40\u201379 years, followed from 1993, formed as a random subsample of the UK-based EPIC-Norfolk cohort. HSV-1 seropositivity was derived from immunoglobulin G measurements and frequent oro-labial HSV reactivation was self-reported. We carried out two cross-sectional studies using logistic regression to investigate childhood social and environmental conditions as risk factors for HSV-1 seropositivity and comorbidities as risk factors for apparent HSV oro-labial reactivation. Results Of 9,929 participants, 6310 (63.6%) were HSV-1 IgG positive, and 870 (of 4,934 seropositive participants with reactivation data) experienced frequent oro-labial reactivation. Being born outside the UK/Ireland, contemporaneous urban living and having 4 siblings were risk factors for HSV-1 seropositivity. Ever diagnosed with kidney disease, but no other comorbidities, was associated with an increased risk of frequent HSV reactivation (adjOR 1.87, 95%CI: 1.02\u20133.40). Discussion Apparent HSV-1 seropositivity and clinical reactivation are common within an ageing UK population. HSV-1 seropositivity is socially patterned while risk factors for oro-labial HSV reactivation are less clear. Further large studies of risk factors are needed to inform HSV-1 control strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibodies, Viral", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Herpes Simplex", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mouth", "Prospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Virus Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065665037", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"38061411100": {"Name": "Forbes H.", "AuthorID": "38061411100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23471079400": {"Name": "Warren-Gash C.", "AuthorID": "23471079400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57195057197": {"Name": "Warne B.", "AuthorID": "57195057197", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57208739835": {"Name": "Doelken L.", "AuthorID": "57208739835", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "9436804100": {"Name": "Gkrania-Klotsas E.", "AuthorID": "9436804100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57201447939": {"Name": "Brenner N.", "AuthorID": "57201447939", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Infections and Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "8891892600": {"Name": "Waterboer T.", "AuthorID": "8891892600", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Infections and Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "57204537801": {"Name": "Luben R.", "AuthorID": "57204537801", "AffiliationID": "60027140", "AffiliationName": "EPIC University, Strangeways Research Laboratory"}, "34668706300": {"Name": "Wareham N.J.", "AuthorID": "34668706300", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
