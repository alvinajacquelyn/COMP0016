XLRS is due to mutations in the RS1 gene located on chromosome Xp22 which codes for retinoschisin and is estimated to affect between 1:5000 to 1:20000 individuals worldwide. We report a case of refractory angle-closure glaucoma in a thirty-nine-year-old Caucasian man with atypical XLRS. The patient presented with a two-day history of left eye pain, acutely reduced vision and a nine-month history of hemicranial pain. Examination identified left intraocular pressure (IOP) of 52mmHg. Gonioscopy confirmed complete angle closure. Following failure of medical management and persistently raised left IOP (43-46mmHg), the patient underwent left phacoemulsification and intraocular lens insertion without complication. After surgery, his IOP reduced to 10-14mmHg on all follow up examinations without the need for glaucoma drops. His iridocorneal angle remained open and vision improved to 20/100. Our case demonstrates the additional role of lens surgery in the treatment of secondary angle-closure glaucoma in the presence of an inherited retinal dystrophy. All patients with inherited retinopathy presenting with a headache or eye pain should undergo gonioscopic examination to exclude angle-closure glaucoma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angle-closure glaucoma", "cataract surgery", "lens extraction", "X-linked retinoschisis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetazolamide", "Adult", "Anticonvulsants", "Glaucoma, Angle-Closure", "Humans", "Male", "Retinoschisis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052120727", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"14052198000": {"Name": "Low S.", "AuthorID": "14052198000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56211463300": {"Name": "Ting M.", "AuthorID": "56211463300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.F.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57200550535": {"Name": "Mohamed R.", "AuthorID": "57200550535", "AffiliationID": "60138357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Abergele Hospital"}}}
