Methods All data points from consecutive 24\u20132 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were extracted from a university database. Ten-fold cross validation with a held out test set was used to develop the three main phases of model development: model architecture selection, dataset combination selection, and time-interval model training with transfer learning, to train a deep learning artificial neural network capable of generating a point-wise visual field prediction. The pointwise mean absolute error (PMAE) and difference in Mean Deviation (MD) between predicted and actual future HVF were calculated. Results More than 1.7 million perimetry points were extracted to the hundredth decibel from 32,443 24\u20132 HVFs. The best performing model with 20 million trainable parameters, CascadeNet-5, was selected. The overall point-wise PMAE for the test set was 2.47 dB (95% CI: 2.45 dB to 2.48 dB), and deep learning showed a statistically significant improvement over linear models. The 100 fully trained models successfully predicted future HVFs in glaucomatous eyes up to 5.5 years in the future with a correlation of 0.92 between the MD of predicted and actual future HVF and an average difference of 0.41 dB. Conclusions Using unfiltered real-world datasets, deep learning networks show the ability to not only learn spatio-temporal HVF changes but also to generate predictions for future HVFs up to 5.5 years, given only a single HVF.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Databases, Factual", "Deep Learning", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Forecasting", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064091153", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56437848300": {"Name": "Wen J.C.", "AuthorID": "56437848300", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "56472056400": {"Name": "Lee C.S.", "AuthorID": "56472056400", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "57208175773": {"Name": "Xiao S.", "AuthorID": "57208175773", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "7408352481": {"Name": "Chen P.P.", "AuthorID": "7408352481", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "57194851622": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57194851622", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "26635526200": {"Name": "Lee A.Y.", "AuthorID": "26635526200", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "eScience Institute, University of Washington"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, University College London (UCL), Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6507945628": {"Name": "Rokem A.S.", "AuthorID": "6507945628", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "eScience Institute, University of Washington"}}}
