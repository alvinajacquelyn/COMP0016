Following a data-driven approach, we identify network infrastructures and the files that they download. We then study their characteristics over a short period (one day), over a medium period (daily, over one month) as well as in the long term (weekly, over one year). This analysis offers us an unprecedented view of the malicious file delivery ecosystem and its dynamics. We find that the malicious file delivery landscape can be divided into two distinct ecosystems: a much larger, tightly connected set of networks that is mostly responsible for the delivery of potentially unwanted programs (PUP), and a number of disjoint network infrastructures that are responsible for delivering malware on victim computers. We find that these two ecosystems are mostly disjoint, but it is not uncommon to see malware downloaded from the PUP Ecosystem, and vice versa. We estimate the proportions of PUPto- malware in the wild to be heavily skewed towards PUP (17:2) and compare their distribution patterns. We observe periodicity in the activity of malicious network infrastructures, and we find that although malicious file operations present a high degree of volatility, 75% of the observed malicious networks remain active for more than six weeks, with 26% surviving for an entire year. We then reason on how our findings can help the research and law enforcement communities in developing better takedown techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Connected sets", "Data-driven approach", "Distribution patterns", "File delivery", "File distribution", "Network infrastructure", "Short periods"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069958694", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57210217180": {"Name": "Ife C.C.", "AuthorID": "57210217180", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "22433357400": {"Name": "Murdoch S.J.", "AuthorID": "22433357400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56228379900": {"Name": "Shen Y.", "AuthorID": "56228379900", "AffiliationID": "60079765", "AffiliationName": "Symantec Research Labs"}, "36810977700": {"Name": "Stringhini G.", "AuthorID": "36810977700", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}}}
