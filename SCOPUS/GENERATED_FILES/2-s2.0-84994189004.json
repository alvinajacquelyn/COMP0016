However, most subset algorithms do not convergence or have a limit cycle. Different strategies to solve this problem exist, for instance using relaxation. The conceptually easiest mechanism is to reduce the number of subsets gradually during iterations. However, the optimal point to reduce the number of subsets is usually depends on many factors such as initialisation, the object itself, amount of noise etc. In this paper, we propose a simple scheme to automatically compute if the number of subsets is too large (or too small) and adjust the size of the data to consider in the next update automatically. The scheme is based on idea of computing two image updates corresponding to different parts of the data. A comparison of these updates then allows to see if the updates were sufficiently consistent or not. We illustrate this idea using 2 different subset algorithms: OSEM and OSSPS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive adjustment", "Common strategy", "Iterative image reconstruction", "Limit-cycle", "Optimal points", "Simple schemes", "Speed up", "Subset algorithm"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994189004", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nuclear Medicine, University College London, UCLH"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
