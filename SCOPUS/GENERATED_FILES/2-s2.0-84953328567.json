The AFE is part of a fully integrated multifrequency EIS platform. The current readout comprises of a transimpedance stage and an automatic gain control (AGC) unit designed to accommodate impedance changes larger than 3 order of magnitude. The AGC is based on a dynamic peak detector that tracks changes in the input current over time and regulates the gain of a programmable gain amplifier in order to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio. The system works up to 1 MHz. The voltage readout consists of a 2 stages of fully differential current-feedback instrumentation amplifier which provide 100 dB of CMRR and a programmable gain up to 20 V/V per stage with a bandwidth in excess of 10MHz.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amplifiers, Electronic", "Biosensing Techniques", "Dielectric Spectroscopy", "Equipment Design", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953328567", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"26428589100": {"Name": "Valente V.", "AuthorID": "26428589100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "15922999900": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "15922999900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
