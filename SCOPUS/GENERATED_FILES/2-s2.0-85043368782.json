We studied both the optical and electrical characteristics of the DWELL photodetectors. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra measured from the DWELL photodetector revealed a long carrier lifetime of 1.52 ns. A low dark current density of 2.03 \u00d7 10-3 mA/cm2 was achieved under 1 V bias at 77 K. The device showed a peak responsivity of 10.9 mA/W under 2 V bias at the wavelength of 6.4 \u03bcm at 77 K, and the corresponding detectivity was 5.78 \u00d7 108 cm\u00b7Hz1/2/W. These results demonstrated that these silicon-based DWELL photodetectors are very promising for future mid-infrared applications, which can enjoy the potential benefit from mid-infrared silicon photonics technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infrared photodetector", "quantum dots-in-a-well", "silicon substrate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical characteristic", "Infrared photodetector", "Mid wave infrared (MWIR)", "Photonics technology", "Potential benefits", "Quantum dots in a well (DWELL)", "Silicon substrates", "Time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043368782", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57200040276": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "57200040276", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57200047752": {"Name": "Deng Z.", "AuthorID": "57200047752", "AffiliationID": "60105232", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronic Device Laboratory, School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University"}, "57200048802": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57200048802", "AffiliationID": "60105232", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronic Device Laboratory, School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University"}, "36894560000": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "36894560000", "AffiliationID": "60105232", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronic Device Laboratory, School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University"}, "57200041993": {"Name": "Guo D.", "AuthorID": "57200041993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005644077": {"Name": "Mazur Y.I.", "AuthorID": "7005644077", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "57188814671": {"Name": "Maidaniuk Y.", "AuthorID": "57188814671", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "57217704550": {"Name": "Benamara M.", "AuthorID": "57217704550", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "7004309232": {"Name": "Salamo G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004309232", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}}}
