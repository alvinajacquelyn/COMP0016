Recent cuts in local authority budgets have accelerated this process. Underpinning it there is an underlying assumption that publicness, however defined, can be guaranteed by means other than public ownership, funding and management, and that public sector ownership and direct control might not be in themselves essential features of spaces that are public. This paper reports on a case study research that investigates the impact on public spaces of the transfer of management away from the public sector. Based on nine case studies of public spaces in London under a variety of different management arrangements, the paper discusses how publicness is affected by the various contractual forms of transfer and what the main implications of this process are for different stakeholders and for the public realm as a whole. The paper suggests that contracted-out management of public space might not necessarily affect publicness negatively. However, it requires judiciously designed accountability mechanisms and clear decisions by all key stakeholders, including local authorities, about whose aspirations will be privileged and how other aspirations should be protected. In a climate of austerity and spending cuts, this requires a different kind of public management and of policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contractual governance", "London", "Privatisation of public space", "Public space management", "Publicness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955252546", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"55934910800": {"Name": "De Magalh\u00e3es C.", "AuthorID": "55934910800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning \u2013 UCL"}, "57074045100": {"Name": "Freire Trigo S.", "AuthorID": "57074045100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning \u2013 UCL"}}}
