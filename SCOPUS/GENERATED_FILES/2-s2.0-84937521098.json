Recent attention focused on this margin has included theoretical modelling studies of rift processes, plate kinematic studies of the opening geometry and timing, and empirical studies focused on documenting the crustal structure and offshore sedimentary record. Here, we examine the onshore geomorphic and tectonic response to rifting and breakup, with a specific focus on the SW Cape of South Africa. We present 75 new apatite and 8 new zircon fission track analyses from outcrop samples and onshore borehole profiles along the western margin of South Africa. The data are used to derive robust thermal histories that record two discrete phases of accelerated erosional cooling during the Early Cretaceous (150-130. Ma) and Late Cretaceous (100-80. Ma), respectively. Both periods of enhanced erosion are regional in extent, involved km-scale erosion, and extend well inland of the current escarpment zone, albeit with spatially variable intensity and style. The Late Cretaceous episode is also expressed more locally by tectonic reactivation and inversion of major faults causing km-scale differential displacement and erosion. The new AFT data do not exclude the possibility of modest surface uplift occurring during the Cenozoic, but they restrict the depth of regional Cenozoic erosion on the western margin to less than c. 1. km. The inferred pattern and chronology of erosion onshore is consistent with the key features and sediment accumulation patterns within the offshore Orange and Bredasdorp basins. It is suggested that the Late Cretaceous event was triggered by a combination of regional dynamic uplift augmented along the western margin and in the SW Cape by local tectonic forces arising from dextral displacement of the Falkland Plateau along the Falkland-Agulhas Fracture Zone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continental margin", "Fission track", "Southwestern Africa", "Thermal history modelling", "Thermochronology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continental margin", "Fission track", "Southwestern Africa", "Thermal history", "Thermochronology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937521098", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"56257995500": {"Name": "Wildman M.", "AuthorID": "56257995500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, College of Science and Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7408438047": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "7408438047", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, College of Science and Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7201422451": {"Name": "Watkins R.", "AuthorID": "7201422451", "AffiliationID": "60001416, 60084455, 60031226", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Engineering, Western Australian School of Mines, Department of Applied Geology, Curtin University of Technology"}, "56003358600": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "56003358600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7004654522": {"Name": "Gleadow A.", "AuthorID": "7004654522", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "7006565850": {"Name": "Summerfield M.", "AuthorID": "7006565850", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geography, University of Edinburgh"}}}
