Current approaches for inducing dynamic movement into cells, however, focus predominantly on mechanical stimulation of single cells, affect cell integrity, and, more importantly, need a complementary mechanism to pattern cells. In this article, we demonstrate a new strategy for the mechanical stimulation of large cell clusters, taking advantage of dielectrophoresis. This strategy is based on the cellular spin resonance mechanism, but it utilizes coating agents, such as bovine serum albumin, to create consistent rotation and vibration of individual cells. The treatment of cells with coating agents intensifies the torque induced on the cells while reducing the friction at the cell-cell and cell-substrate interfaces, resulting in the consistent motion of the cells. Such localized motion can be modulated by varying the frequency and voltage of the applied sinusoidal AC signal and can be achieved in the absence and presence of flow. This strategy enables the survival and functioning of moving cells within large-scale clusters to be investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bovine serum albumins", "Complementary mechanisms", "Dynamic movements", "Important features", "Individual cells", "Large-scale clusters", "Living organisms", "Mechanical stimulation", "Animals", "Cattle", "Electrophoresis", "Models, Molecular", "Particle Size", "Rotation", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Serum Albumin, Bovine", "Surface Properties", "Vibration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923163554", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"56096339200": {"Name": "Soffe R.", "AuthorID": "56096339200", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University"}, "55701718500": {"Name": "Tang S.Y.", "AuthorID": "55701718500", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University"}, "35232586000": {"Name": "Baratchi S.", "AuthorID": "35232586000", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Health Innovations Research Institute, RMIT University"}, "25822712200": {"Name": "Nasabi M.", "AuthorID": "25822712200", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University"}, "7402039660": {"Name": "Mitchell A.", "AuthorID": "7402039660", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University"}, "55894165200": {"Name": "Khoshmanesh K.", "AuthorID": "55894165200", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University"}, "56096999300": {"Name": "Nahavandi S.", "AuthorID": "56096999300", "AffiliationID": "60024749, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Bioelectronics Research Centre, Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
