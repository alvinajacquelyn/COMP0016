Successful disease elimination campaigns are characterised by locally tailored responses that are informed by appropriate data. To develop such a response to tuberculosis, we suggest a three-step process that includes improved collection and use of existing programmatic data, collection of additional data (eg, geographic information, drug resistance, and risk factors) to inform tailored responses, and targeted collection of novel data (eg, sequencing data, targeted surveys, and contact investigations) to improve understanding of tuberculosis transmission dynamics. Development of a locally targeted response for tuberculosis will require substantial investment to reconfigure existing systems, coupled with additional empirical data to evaluate the effectiveness of specific approaches. Without adoption of an elimination strategy that uses local data to target hotspots of transmission, ambitious targets to end tuberculosis will almost certainly remain unmet.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Typing Techniques", "Data Collection", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Ethics, Medical", "Geographic Information Systems", "Geographic Mapping", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949527433", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"46161739300": {"Name": "Theron G.", "AuthorID": "46161739300", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Lung Infection and Immunity Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "57204302755": {"Name": "Jenkins H.E.", "AuthorID": "57204302755", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "7004225016": {"Name": "Cobelens F.", "AuthorID": "7004225016", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Academic Medical Center"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7404909926": {"Name": "Khan A.J.", "AuthorID": "7404909926", "AffiliationID": "101605939", "AffiliationName": "Interactive Research and Development"}, "7202415780": {"Name": "Cohen T.", "AuthorID": "7202415780", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"}, "6603069678": {"Name": "Dowdy D.W.", "AuthorID": "6603069678", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}}}
