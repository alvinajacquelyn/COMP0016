Following major advances of the used genetic constructs over the last decade, the light sources required for optogenetic control are now receiving increased attention. We report a novel optogenetic illumination platform based on high-density arrays of microscopic organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Because of the small dimensions of each array element (6 9 mm2) and the use of ultrathin device encapsulation, these arrays enable illumination of cells with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.We show that adherent eukaryotic cells readily proliferate on these arrays, and we demonstrate specific light-induced control of the ionic current across the membrane of individual live cells expressing different optogenetic constructs. Our work paves the way for the use of OLEDs for cell-specific optogenetic control in cultured neuronal networks and for acute brain slices, or as implants in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Array elements", "Cultured neuronal networks", "Device encapsulations", "Eukaryotic cells", "High resolution", "High-density arrays", "Ionic current", "Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs)", "Biomarkers", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Survival", "Electronics", "Gene Expression", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Light", "Optical Phenomena", "Optogenetics", "Photic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006048790", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35761492600": {"Name": "Steude A.", "AuthorID": "35761492600", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA), School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews"}, "12140186200": {"Name": "Gather M.C.", "AuthorID": "12140186200", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA), School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews"}, "55179404700": {"Name": "Witts E.C.", "AuthorID": "55179404700", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "7005952003": {"Name": "Miles G.B.", "AuthorID": "7005952003", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}}}
