All rights reserved.The study of biliary disease has been constrained by a lack of primary human cholangiocytes. Here we present an efficient, serum-free protocol for directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into cholangiocyte-like cells (CLCs). CLCs show functional characteristics of cholangiocytes, including bile acids transfer, alkaline phosphatase activity, \u03b3-glutamyl-transpeptidase activity and physiological responses to secretin, somatostatin and vascular endothelial growth factor. We use CLCs to model in vitro key features of Alagille syndrome, polycystic liver disease and cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated cholangiopathy. Furthermore, we use CLCs generated from healthy individuals and patients with polycystic liver disease to reproduce the effects of the drugs verapamil and octreotide, and we show that the experimental CF drug VX809 rescues the disease phenotype of CF cholangiopathy in vitro. Our differentiation protocol will facilitate the study of biological mechanisms controlling biliary development, as well as disease modeling and drug screening.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline phosphatase activity", "Biological mechanisms", "Directed differentiations", "Functional characteristics", "Healthy individuals", "Human-induced pluripotent stem cells", "Physiological response", "Vascular endothelial growth factor", "Biliary Tract", "Biomedical Research", "Cells, Cultured", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Liver Diseases", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938883598", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"36490414600": {"Name": "Sampaziotis F.", "AuthorID": "36490414600", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56237242200": {"Name": "De Brito M.C.", "AuthorID": "56237242200", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Anne McLaren Laboratory, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "54395759800": {"Name": "Madrigal P.", "AuthorID": "54395759800", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "37116505500": {"Name": "Bertero A.", "AuthorID": "37116505500", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Anne McLaren Laboratory, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "56024355700": {"Name": "Soares F.A.C.", "AuthorID": "56024355700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Anne McLaren Laboratory, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "56432873800": {"Name": "Hannan N.R.F.", "AuthorID": "56432873800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Anne McLaren Laboratory, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "22946015000": {"Name": "Vallier L.", "AuthorID": "22946015000", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "6603015439": {"Name": "Saeb-Parsy K.", "AuthorID": "6603015439", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7402238845": {"Name": "Bradley J.A.", "AuthorID": "7402238845", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7005662495": {"Name": "Schrumpf E.", "AuthorID": "7005662495", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "57203977289": {"Name": "Melum E.", "AuthorID": "57203977289", "AffiliationID": "60069109, 60026108", "AffiliationName": "K.G.
