Additional theories have been proposed over the years to explain observations that did not agree with the originally proposed fast-mode wave interpretation. However, the incompatibility of observations made using the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory with the fast-mode wave interpretation was challenged by differing viewpoints from the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft and data with higher spatial and temporal resolution from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. In this article, we reexamine the theories proposed to explain EIT waves to identify measurable properties and behaviours that can be compared to current and future observations. Most of us conclude that the so-called EIT waves are best described as fast-mode large-amplitude waves or shocks that are initially driven by the impulsive expansion of an erupting coronal mass ejection in the low corona.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronal mass ejections, low coronal signatures", "Waves, magnetohydrodynamic", "Waves, propagation", "Waves, shock"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006039316", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57211231301": {"Name": "Long D.M.", "AuthorID": "57211231301", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "7006222356": {"Name": "Bloomfield D.S.", "AuthorID": "7006222356", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Northumbria University"}, "7202273499": {"Name": "Gallagher P.T.", "AuthorID": "7202273499", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Trinity College Dublin, College Green"}, "55768071700": {"Name": "Chen P.F.", "AuthorID": "55768071700", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Astronomy & Space Science, Nanjing University"}, "35769089800": {"Name": "Downs C.", "AuthorID": "35769089800", "AffiliationID": "60112892", "AffiliationName": "Predictive Science Inc."}, "27267716600": {"Name": "Kwon R.Y.", "AuthorID": "27267716600", "AffiliationID": "60018319", "AffiliationName": "College of Science, George Mason University"}, "44761601800": {"Name": "Vanninathan K.", "AuthorID": "44761601800", "AffiliationID": "60022457", "AffiliationName": "Kanzelh\u00f6he Observatory/IGAM, Institute of Physics, University of Graz"}, "6701714180": {"Name": "Veronig A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701714180", "AffiliationID": "60022457", "AffiliationName": "Kanzelh\u00f6he Observatory/IGAM, Institute of Physics, University of Graz"}, "6603876524": {"Name": "Vourlidas A.", "AuthorID": "6603876524", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Applied Physics Laboratory, The Johns Hopkins University"}, "7004309757": {"Name": "Vr\u0161nak B.", "AuthorID": "7004309757", "AffiliationID": "60103666", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Geodesy, Hvar Observatory"}, "16647835700": {"Name": "\u017dic T.", "AuthorID": "16647835700", "AffiliationID": "60103666", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Geodesy, Hvar Observatory"}, "6601996610": {"Name": "Warmuth A.", "AuthorID": "6601996610", "AffiliationID": "60000677", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)"}}}
