A multielement fiber is used for SDM transmission to provide a large quantity of optical links between the top-of-racks (ToRs) and the function programmable cluster switch. Beam-steering large-port-count fiber switches, used as central cluster switches and intercluster switch, provide a single hop optical circuit switching solution, and also enable network function programmability for DCN to support variable traffic patterns and different network functions. A TDM switch as a plug-in function provides intra-cluster communication with variable capacity and low latency. The flat-structured intra data center architecture, with a circuit-switched SDM and TDM hybrid network enables scalable, large-capacity and low-latency DCN communication. In addition, all-optical ToR-to-ToR inter-DCN is realized through metro/core networks. A highly-nonlinear fiber based all-optical SDM-to-WDM converter transfers three SDM signals to three-carrier spectral superchannel signals, which are transmitted to the destination DCN, through the metro/core networks. The all-optical ToR-ToR cross-DCN connections enable the geographically distributed DCNs to appear as one big data center.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data CenterNetworking", "Optical Interconnects", "Space Division Multiplexing", "Time Division Multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data center architecture", "Data center networkings", "Data CenterNetworking", "Highly nonlinear fibers", "Intra-cluster communication", "Optical circuit switching", "Optical interconnect", "Space division multiplexing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925046600", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56926913200": {"Name": "Yan S.", "AuthorID": "56926913200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "35219784900": {"Name": "Hugues-Salas E.", "AuthorID": "35219784900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "57206465295": {"Name": "Shu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206465295", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "56115136200": {"Name": "Saridis G.", "AuthorID": "56115136200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "54684934300": {"Name": "Rahimzadeh Rofoee B.", "AuthorID": "54684934300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "55625791200": {"Name": "Yan Y.", "AuthorID": "55625791200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "56438680300": {"Name": "Peters A.", "AuthorID": "56438680300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "12784155200": {"Name": "Simeonidou D.", "AuthorID": "12784155200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "54407259600": {"Name": "Rancano V.", "AuthorID": "54407259600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Center, University of Southampton"}, "37093228900": {"Name": "Jain S.", "AuthorID": "37093228900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Center, University of Southampton"}, "6505897974": {"Name": "May-Smith T.", "AuthorID": "6505897974", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Center, University of Southampton"}, "7004549449": {"Name": "Petropoulos P.", "AuthorID": "7004549449", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Center, University of Southampton"}, "57209551557": {"Name": "Richardson D.", "AuthorID": "57209551557", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Center, University of Southampton"}}}
