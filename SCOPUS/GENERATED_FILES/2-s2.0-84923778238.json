As South Asians in the UK have an excess risk of CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) compared to Europeans, we investigated whether a similar association between combined health behaviours and risk of CVD and CHD among this high-risk group exists, and estimated the population impact. Methods and Findings: In a prospective cohort of 1090 Europeans and 1006 South Asians (40-69 y) without prevalent CVD at baseline (1988-1990), followed up for 21 years to 2011, there were 601 incident CVD events [Europeans n = 255; South Asians n = 346] of which 520 were CHD events [n = 207 and 313 respectively]. Participants scored between 0 to 4 points for a composite score including four baseline healthy behaviours (non-smoker, moderate alcohol intake, physically active, frequent fruit/vegetable intake). Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident CHD in Europeans who had three, two, one, and zero compared to four health behaviours were 1.33 (0.78-2.29), 1.96 (1.15-3.33), 1.36 (0.74-2.48) and 2.45 (1.18-5.10), respectively, p-trend = 0.025. In South Asians, corresponding HRs were 2.88 (1.33-6.24), 2.28 (1.06-4.91), 3.36 (1.53-7.39) and 3.48 (1.38-8.81), p-trend = 0.022. The results were similar for incident CVD; Europeans HR 2.12 (1.14-3.94), p-trend = 0.014; South Asians HR 2.73 (1.20-6.21), p-trend = 0.018. The population attributable fraction in Europeans was 43% for CHD and 28% for CVD. In South Asians it was 63% and 51% respectively. Conclusions: Lack of adherence to four combined health behaviours was associated with 2 to 3-fold increased risk of incident CVD in Europeans and South Asians. A substantial population impact in the South Asian group indicates important potential for disease prevention in this high-risk group by adherence to healthy behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923778238", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191747111": {"Name": "Eriksen A.", "AuthorID": "57191747111", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "56531601800": {"Name": "Connor L.O.", "AuthorID": "56531601800", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "7003968294": {"Name": "Brage S.", "AuthorID": "7003968294", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "6603478414": {"Name": "Forouhi N.G.", "AuthorID": "6603478414", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7006017382": {"Name": "Mayet J.", "AuthorID": "7006017382", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "7005585588": {"Name": "McKeigue P.", "AuthorID": "7005585588", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Centre, St george'S,University of London"}}}
