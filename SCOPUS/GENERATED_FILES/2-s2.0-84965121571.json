The present study adopted a longitudinal design to consider how existing transition strategies, categorized into cognitive, behavioral or systemic approaches, were associated with post-transition anxiety amongst 532 typically developing children and 89 children with SEN. Multiple regression analysis indicated that amongst typically developing pupils, systemic interventions were associated with lower school anxiety but not generalized anxiety, when controlling for prior anxiety. Results for children with SEN differed significantly, as illustrated by a Group \u00d7 Intervention type interaction. Specifically, systemic strategies were associated with lower school anxiety amongst typically developing children and higher school anxiety amongst children with SEN. These findings highlight strategies that schools may find useful in supporting typically developing children over the transition period, whilst suggesting that children with SEN might need a more personalized approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Intervention", "Primary/elementary school", "Secondary transfer/transition", "Secondary/middle/junior high school", "Special educational needs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Anxiety", "Child", "Educational Status", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "School Health Services", "Schools", "Social Adjustment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965121571", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57214548253": {"Name": "Neal S.", "AuthorID": "57214548253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004377110": {"Name": "Rice F.", "AuthorID": "7004377110", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University"}, "56190592700": {"Name": "Ng-Knight T.", "AuthorID": "56190592700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55643393700": {"Name": "Riglin L.", "AuthorID": "55643393700", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University"}, "6603587474": {"Name": "Frederickson N.", "AuthorID": "6603587474", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
