The correlation between trait EI and the GFP was so high (\u03c1 = 0.88) in that meta-analysis that these two may be considered virtually identical constructs. The present study builds on these findings by examining whether the strong phenotypic correlation between the GFP and trait EI has a genetic component. In a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, the heritability estimates for the GFP and trait EI were 53 and 45%, respectively. Moreover, there was a strong genetic correlation of r =.90 between the GFP and trait EI. Additional analyses suggested that a substantial proportion of the genetic correlations reflects non-additive genetic effects (e.g., dominance and epistasis). These findings are discussed in light of evolutionary accounts of the GFP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["General factor of personality", "Genetic correlation", "Heritability", "TEIQue", "Trait emotional intelligence", "Twins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Emotional Intelligence", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Personality", "Phenotype", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Twins, Dizygotic", "Twins, Monozygotic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038638970", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6602552096": {"Name": "van der Linden D.", "AuthorID": "6602552096", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "57191954696": {"Name": "Pekaar K.", "AuthorID": "57191954696", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "57205383513": {"Name": "Bakker A.", "AuthorID": "57205383513", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "57190401394": {"Name": "Schermer J.", "AuthorID": "57190401394", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Management and Organizational Studies, University of Western Ontario"}, "55348358200": {"Name": "de Zeeuw E.", "AuthorID": "55348358200", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Psychology, Free University Amsterdam"}, "9234632000": {"Name": "Dunkel C.", "AuthorID": "9234632000", "AffiliationID": "60010100", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Western Illinois University"}, "7005924967": {"Name": "Vernon P.", "AuthorID": "7005924967", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}}}
