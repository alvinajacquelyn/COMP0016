Micro-cracks induced by the cutting process in the thin wafers can lead to brittle wafer fracture. Guided ultrasonic waves would offer an efficient methodology for the in-process non-destructive testing of wafers to assess micro-crack density. The material anisotropy of the monocrystalline silicon leads to variations of the guided wave characteristics, depending on the propagation direction relative to the crystal orientation. Selective guided ultrasonic wave excitation was achieved using a contact piezoelectric transducer with custom-made wedges for the A0 and S0 Lamb wave modes and a transducer holder to achieve controlled contact pressure and orientation. The out-of-plane component of the guided wave propagation was measured using a non-contact laser interferometer. The phase slowness (velocity) of the two fundamental Lamb wave modes was measured experimentally for varying propagation directions relative to the crystal orientation and found to match theoretical predictions. Significant wave beam skew was observed experimentally, especially for the S0 mode, and investigated from 3D finite element simulations. Good agreement was found with the theoretical predictions based on nominal material properties of the silicon wafer. The important contribution of guided wave beam skewing effects for the non-destructive testing of silicon wafers was demonstrated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elastic Anisotropy", "Lamb Wave Modes", "NDE", "Phase Slowness", "Skew Angle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046467623", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57194524303": {"Name": "Pizzolato M.", "AuthorID": "57194524303", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Applied Sciences"}, "6505811171": {"Name": "Masserey B.", "AuthorID": "6505811171", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Applied Sciences"}, "35148508800": {"Name": "Robyr J.", "AuthorID": "35148508800", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Applied Sciences"}, "23977809500": {"Name": "Fromme P.", "AuthorID": "23977809500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
