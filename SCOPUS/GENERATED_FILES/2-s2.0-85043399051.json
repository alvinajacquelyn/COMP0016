This study aimed to assess whether NH can be detected in the absence of other signs of nocturnal altered gas exchange. Methods: We performed nocturnal transcutaneous coupled (tc) pCO2/SpO2 monitoring in 46 consecutive cases of paediatric-onset NMD with a restrictive respiratory defect (forced vital capacity < 60%). Nocturnal hypoventilation was defined as tcPCO2 > 50 mmHg for > 25% of recorded time, and hypoxemia as tcSpO2 < 88% for > 5 minutes. Daytime symptoms and bicarbonate were recorded after overnight monitoring. Results: Twenty-nine of 46 consecutive patients showed NH. Twenty-three patients did not have nocturnal hypoxemia and 18 were clinically asymptomatic. In 20 patients, PaCO2 in daytime blood samples was normal. Finally, 13/29 patients with NH had isolated nocturnal hypercapnia without nocturnal hypoxia, clinical NH symptoms, or daytime hypercapnia. Conclusions: Paediatric patients with NMD can develop NH in the absence of clinical symptoms or significant nocturnal desaturation. Therefore, monitoring of NH should be included among nocturnal respiratory assessments of these patients as an additional tool to determine when to commence non-invasive ventilation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nocturnal hypoventilation", "non-invasive ventilation", "overnight pulse oximetry", "paediatric neuromuscular disorders", "sleep-disordered breathing", "transcutaneous capnography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous", "Carbon Dioxide", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Hypercapnia", "Hypoventilation", "Male", "Muscular Dystrophies", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Myopathies, Structural, Congenital", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Retrospective Studies", "Sclerosis", "Spinal Muscular Atrophies of Childhood", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043399051", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"6603727911": {"Name": "Pedemonte M.", "AuthorID": "6603727911", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "8383803700": {"Name": "Fiorillo C.", "AuthorID": "8383803700", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "23567764000": {"Name": "Brisca G.", "AuthorID": "23567764000", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "57190950261": {"Name": "Tacchetti P.", "AuthorID": "57190950261", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7006089242": {"Name": "Minetti C.", "AuthorID": "7006089242", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "46661913100": {"Name": "Tan H.", "AuthorID": "46661913100", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7004775285": {"Name": "Carlucci A.", "AuthorID": "7004775285", "AffiliationID": "60018722", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Fondazione S Maugeri"}, "7102981546": {"Name": "Bruno C.", "AuthorID": "7102981546", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Center of Myology and Neurodegenerative Disorders, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "23969732600": {"Name": "Trucco F.", "AuthorID": "23969732600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
