{"Title": "Plasma IL-5 concentration and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Atherosclerosis", "Volume": "239", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 125, "PageEnd": 130, "CitedBy": 22, "DOI": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2014.12.046", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84920913603&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015.Objective: Genetic variants robustly associated with coronary artery disease were reported in the vicinity of the interleukin (IL)-5 locus, and animal studies suggested a protective role for IL-5 in atherosclerosis. Therefore, we set this work to explore IL-5 as a plasma biomarker for early subclinical atherosclerosis, as determined by measures of baseline severity and change over time of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT). Methods: We used biobank and databases of IMPROVE, a large European prospective cohort study of high-risk individuals (n=3534) free of clinically overt cardiovascular disease at enrollment, in whom composite and segment-specific measures of cIMT were recorded at baseline and after 15 and 30 months. IL-5 was measured with an immunoassay in plasma samples taken at baseline. Results: IL-5 levels were lower in women than in men, lower in the South than in North of Europe, and showed positive correlations with most established risk factors. IL-5 showed significant inverse relationships with cIMT change over time in the common carotid segment in women, but no significant relationships to baseline cIMT in either men or women. Conclusions: Our results suggest that IL-5 may be part of protective mechanisms operating in early atherosclerosis, at least in women. However, the relationships are weak and whereas IL-5 has been proposed as a potential molecular target to treat allergies, it is difficult to envisage such a scenario in coronary artery disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Coronary artery disease", "Cytokines", "Interleukin-5", "Intima-media thickness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Anthropometry", "Biological Specimen Banks", "Biomarkers", "Carotid Arteries", "Carotid Artery Diseases", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Disease Progression", "Europe", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Interleukin-5", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Regression Analysis", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920913603", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7007036421": {"Name": "Silveira A.", "AuthorID": "7007036421", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55987463800": {"Name": "McLeod O.", "AuthorID": "55987463800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "20434386200": {"Name": "Strawbridge R.J.", "AuthorID": "20434386200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6603484372": {"Name": "Gertow K.", "AuthorID": "6603484372", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6602244170": {"Name": "Sennblad B.", "AuthorID": "6602244170", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet"}, "35486897200": {"Name": "Deleskog A.", "AuthorID": "35486897200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6602262468": {"Name": "\u00d6hrvik J.", "AuthorID": "6602262468", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7101682939": {"Name": "Hamsten A.", "AuthorID": "7101682939", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6701322321": {"Name": "Baldassarre D.", "AuthorID": "6701322321", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "7006057885": {"Name": "Tremoli E.", "AuthorID": "7006057885", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "21136513100": {"Name": "Veglia F.", "AuthorID": "21136513100", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "57191110258": {"Name": "Persson J.", "AuthorID": "57191110258", "AffiliationID": "60026150, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd University Hospital"}, "57208610993": {"Name": "Leander K.", "AuthorID": "57208610993", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7003480904": {"Name": "Gigante B.", "AuthorID": "7003480904", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7103145439": {"Name": "de Faire U.", "AuthorID": "7103145439", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004559228": {"Name": "Kauhanen J.", "AuthorID": "7004559228", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7006315020": {"Name": "Rauramaa R.", "AuthorID": "7006315020", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Research in Health, Exercise and Nutrition, Kuopio Research Institute of Exercise Medicine"}, "7103114601": {"Name": "Smit A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103114601", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen and University of Groningen"}, "26643283400": {"Name": "Mannarino E.", "AuthorID": "26643283400", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Angiology and Arteriosclerosis Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia"}, "7006482932": {"Name": "Giral P.", "AuthorID": "7006482932", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60015622", "AffiliationName": "Assistance Publique -
