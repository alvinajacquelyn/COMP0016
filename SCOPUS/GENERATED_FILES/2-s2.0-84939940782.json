Methods: Postmortem diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the thorax and abdomen were performed with diffusion gradient values b = 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm2 on 15 foetal and childhood cases (mean 33.3 \u00b1 7.8 weeks gestation) compared to 44 live infants (mean age 75.5 \u00b1 53.4 days). Mean ADC values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) for the lungs, liver, spleen and renal cortex, compared to normative live infantile body ADC values of similar gestational age. Results: Mean ADC values were significantly lower in postmortem cases than in normal controls for liver (0.88 10-3 mm2/s \u00b1 SD 0.39 vs. 1.13 \u00b1 0.13; p < 0.05) and renal cortex (0.85 \u00b1 0.26 vs. 1.19 \u00b1 0.13; p < 0.05) but not spleen or muscle. Mean lung ADC values were significantly higher than normal controls (1.06 \u00b1 0.18 vs. 0 \u00b1 0; p < 0.001), and there was a significant correlation between postmortem interval and lung ADC (R2 = 0.55). Conclusion: Lung PMMR ADC values are related to postmortem interval, making them a potential marker of time since death. Further research is needed to understand the organ-specific changes which occur in the postmortem period. Key Points: \u2022 Liver and spleen PM ADC values were lower than controls. \u2022 Lung ADC changes correlate with PM interval. \u2022 These findings may be useful in medicolegal cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Diffusion", "MRI", "Paediatric", "Perinatal", "Postmortem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Congenital Abnormalities", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Fetal Death", "Fetal Diseases", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Kidney Cortex", "Liver", "Lung", "Male", "Postmortem Changes", "Retrospective Studies", "Spleen", "Stillbirth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939940782", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Biophysics, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56447967900": {"Name": "Price G.C.", "AuthorID": "56447967900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.W.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Biophysics, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55722599100": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55722599100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57218666629": {"Name": "Norman W.", "AuthorID": "57218666629", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
