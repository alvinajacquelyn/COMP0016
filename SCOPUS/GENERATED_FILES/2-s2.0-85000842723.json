However, most white matter voxels contain contributions from multiple fibre populations (often referred to as crossing fibres), and therefore voxel-averaged quantitative measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy) are not fibre-specific and have poor interpretability. Using higher-order diffusion models, parameters related to fibre density can be extracted for individual fibre populations within each voxel (\u2018fixels\u2019), and recent advances in statistics enable the multi-subject analysis of such data. However, investigating within-voxel microscopic fibre density alone does not account for macroscopic differences in the white matter morphology (e.g. the calibre of a fibre bundle). In this work, we introduce a novel method to investigate the latter, which we call fixel-based morphometry (FBM). To obtain a more complete measure related to the total number of white matter axons, information from both within-voxel microscopic fibre density and macroscopic morphology must be combined. We therefore present the FBM method as an integral piece within a comprehensive fixel-based analysis framework to investigate measures of fibre density, fibre-bundle morphology (cross-section), and a combined measure of fibre density and cross-section. We performed simulations to demonstrate the proposed measures using various transformations of a numerical fibre bundle phantom. Finally, we provide an example of such an analysis by comparing a clinical patient group to a healthy control group, which demonstrates that all three measures provide distinct and complementary information. By capturing information from both sources, the combined fibre density and cross-section measure is likely to be more sensitive to certain pathologies and more directly interpretable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-section", "Density", "Diffusion", "Fibre", "Fixel", "MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Humans", "Nerve Fibers, Myelinated", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000842723", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"35213625100": {"Name": "Raffelt D.A.", "AuthorID": "35213625100", "AffiliationID": "60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "55727386600": {"Name": "Smith R.E.", "AuthorID": "55727386600", "AffiliationID": "60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "36776461500": {"Name": "Vaughan D.N.", "AuthorID": "36776461500", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60030410, 60005087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Austin Health and Northern Health, University of Melbourne"}, "7402320843": {"Name": "Jackson G.", "AuthorID": "7402320843", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60030410, 60005087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Austin Health and Northern Health, University of Melbourne"}, "7007072426": {"Name": "Connelly A.", "AuthorID": "7007072426", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60030410, 60005087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Austin Health and Northern Health, University of Melbourne"}, "7005529767": {"Name": "Tournier J.D.", "AuthorID": "7005529767", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King's College London"}, "15043112700": {"Name": "Ridgway G.R.", "AuthorID": "15043112700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
