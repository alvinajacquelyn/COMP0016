Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThis study explores the selective use of video as a medium to support reflective processes as related to dental undergraduate learning. With the objective of developing and enhancing high-quality adult dental care, the use of compiled video materials created in an undergraduate clinical setting was investigated. Video cameras were used to capture elements of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action typically found during everyday clinical practice. \u2018Gold standard\u2019 or \u2018textbook outcomes\u2019 are rarely, if ever, fully achieved in dental practice. Real-life clinical experiences offer challenges and opportunities for both teachers and students to engage with reflective learning processes. The materials generated allowed for an experience of individual reflective learning and the creation of a data bank or archive with potential use for the benefit of a wider student cohort. Various aspects of the students\u2019 views and comments on the process of reflection were reported and explored by means of a semi-structured focus group moderated by a linked educational advisor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical pedagogy", "dental undergraduates", "reflection-in-action", "reflection-on-action", "video vignettes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Education, Dental", "Faculty, Dental", "Humans", "Learning", "Students, Dental", "Teaching", "Video Recording"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947715456", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"16226844500": {"Name": "Davies B.R.", "AuthorID": "16226844500", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Primary Dental Care, King's College London Dental Institute"}, "56283991200": {"Name": "Blum I.R.", "AuthorID": "56283991200", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Primary Dental Care, King's College London Dental Institute"}, "35339593400": {"Name": "Leung A.N.", "AuthorID": "35339593400", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Continuing Professional Development, Eastman Dental Institution"}, "7005244124": {"Name": "Dunne S.M.", "AuthorID": "7005244124", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Primary Dental Care and Advanced General Dental Practice, King's College London Dental Institute"}, "7201523257": {"Name": "Dillon J.", "AuthorID": "7201523257", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Education, University of Bristol"}}}
