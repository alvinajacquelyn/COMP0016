Commercial probiotic strains and products, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5\u00ae, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12\u00ae, Probio 7\u00ae and Symprove\u2122 were co-cultured with C. difficile in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride and 0.1% (w/v) sodium taurocholate and monitored in the microcalorimeter. Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIMB 8628 was also co-cultured with C. difficile and studied. The results indicated inhibition of C. difficile by the probiotics. The inhibition of C. difficile was shown to be pH-dependent using neutralized and unmodified cell free supernatant (CFS) produced by the probiotic strains. However, concentrated CFS of the probiotics also inhibited the intestinal pathogen in a non pH-dependent manner, likely due to specific antimicrobial substances produced. The results also indicated that C. difficile growth was greatly influenced by the presence of sodium taurocholate and by the pH of the medium. A medium pH of between 6.45 and 6.9 demonstrated maximum growth of the organism in the microcalorimeter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clostridium difficile", "Co-culture", "Inhibition", "Isothermal microcalorimetry", "Probiotics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibiosis", "Bacteriocins", "Bifidobacterium", "Calorimetry", "Clostridium difficile", "Coculture Techniques", "Culture Media", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Lactobacillus", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Probiotics", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Taurocholic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001020545", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56481659900": {"Name": "Fredua-Agyeman M.", "AuthorID": "56481659900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7005723104": {"Name": "Beezer A.", "AuthorID": "7005723104", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
