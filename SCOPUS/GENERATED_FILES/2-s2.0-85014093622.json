Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the CP score and the MELD score for short- and long-term prognosis in cirrhosis, as well as CP-creatinine score, MELD-Na score, and UKELD score. Methods: One thousand and forty-seven patients from five referral centers were included: men/women: 620/427, median age: 58 years (IQR 48\u201366), median follow-up: 33 months (IQR 12\u201374), CP (A/B/C): 493/357/147, CP score: 7 (IQR 5\u20139), MELD score: 12 (IQR 9\u201316). The performance of each score was evaluated by the Cox hazard model in terms of their: discrimination ability (C-index and Somer\u2019s D) and calibration (3, 12 months). Internal validation was done with bootstrapping (100 samples). Results: Three hundred and fifty-two patients (33.6%) died. All scores were significantly associated with overall mortality, when assessed by univariate Cox analysis. CP-creatinine score performed significantly better than all other scores [bootstrap C-index 0.672, 95% CI 0.642\u20130.703, bootstrap Somer\u2019s D 0.344 (0.285\u20130.401)], apart from CP score, which showed similar performance. Inclusion in the multivariable Cox model of age together with CP-creatinine score improved the discriminative ability of the model [bootstrap C-index (95% CI) 0.700 (0.661\u20130.740)]. In terms of calibration, CP-creatinine score was the best for both 3- and 12-month survival in the total population. Conclusions: CP score and CP-creatinine score have better prognostic value compared to MELD score, MELD-Na score, and UKELD score for predicting short- and long-term mortality in patients with stable cirrhosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cirrhosis", "Cox proportional hazards models", "Liver diseases", "Prognosis", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014093622", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"53866707300": {"Name": "Kalafateli M.", "AuthorID": "53866707300", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Patras"}, "35742559000": {"Name": "Zisimopoulos K.", "AuthorID": "35742559000", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Patras"}, "56441717500": {"Name": "Diamantopoulou G.", "AuthorID": "56441717500", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Patras"}, "6701662770": {"Name": "Thomopoulos K.", "AuthorID": "6701662770", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Patras"}, "8878809700": {"Name": "Triantos C.", "AuthorID": "8878809700", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Patras"}, "24467020600": {"Name": "Vourli G.", "AuthorID": "24467020600", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56252921300": {"Name": "Touloumi G.", "AuthorID": "56252921300", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "16679697200": {"Name": "Rigamonti C.", "AuthorID": "16679697200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603115432": {"Name": "Goulis J.", "AuthorID": "6603115432", "AffiliationID": "60015066, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Aristotle University Medical School, Hippokration General Hospital of Thessaloniki"}, "6604038097": {"Name": "Akriviadis E.", "AuthorID": "6604038097", "AffiliationID": "60015066, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Aristotle University Medical School, Hippokration General Hospital of Thessaloniki"}, "57201805899": {"Name": "Manesis E.", "AuthorID": "57201805899", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60060583", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Internal Medicine, Athens University Medical School, Hippokration General Hospital of Athens"}, "6602688592": {"Name": "Manolakopoulos S.", "AuthorID": "6602688592", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60060583", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Internal Medicine, Athens University Medical School, Hippokration General Hospital of Athens"}, "25221308800": {"Name": "Georgiou A.", "AuthorID": "25221308800", "AffiliationID": "60069142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Polyclinic General Hospital"}, "35548368400": {"Name": "Gogos C.", "AuthorID": "35548368400", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras"}, "6507225289": {"Name": "Lambropoulou-Karatza C.", "AuthorID": "6507225289", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras"}}}
