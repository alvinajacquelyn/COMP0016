However, in the typical scenario a particle spreads over multiple sites and its evolution is not directly useful for controlled quantum interferometry, as may be required for technological applications. In this paper we devise a strategy to perfectly split the wave packet of an incoming particle into two components, each propagating in opposite directions, which reconstruct the shape of the initial wavefunction after a particular time t\u2217. Therefore, a particle in a \u03b4-like initial state becomes exactly delocalized between two distant sites after t\u2217. We find the mathematical conditions to achieve the perfect splitting, which are satisfied by viable example Hamiltonians with static site-dependent interaction strengths. Our results pave the way for the generation of peculiar many-body interference patterns in a many-site atomic chain (such as the Hanbury Brown and Twiss and quantum Talbot effects) as well as for the distribution of entanglement between remote sites. Thus, as for the case of perfect state transfer, the perfect wave-packet splitting can be a new tool for varied applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Delocalizations", "Interaction strength", "Interference patterns", "One-dimensional lattice", "Quantum interferometry", "Quantum random walks", "Technological applications", "Wave packet splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930506999", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"8910867800": {"Name": "Banchi L.", "AuthorID": "8910867800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56670375500": {"Name": "Compagno E.", "AuthorID": "56670375500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
