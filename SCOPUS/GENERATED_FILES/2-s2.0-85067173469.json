Study design: All couples underwent controlled ovarian stimulation, blastocyst biopsy, vitrification and transfer of suitable embryo(s) in a frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle. Results: Of 175 couples who underwent PGT treatment, 249 oocytes retrievals were carried out and 230 FET were subsequently undertaken. 122/230 (53%, 95% CI 47\u201359) FET resulted in a LB and 16/230 (7%, 95% CI 4\u201311) have resulted in ongoing pregnancies. 21/230 (9%, 95% CI 6\u201314) FET resulted in miscarriage and 69/230 (30%, 95% CI 24\u201336) concluded with failed implantation. Two (1%, 95% CI 0\u20133) transfers underwent termination for congenital malformation, with no evidence of misdiagnosis by prenatal testing. The relationship between number of oocytes retrieved and number of blastocysts biopsied and suitable embryos to transfer were significant (p = 0.00; Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.05; 95% 1.04\u20131.06; p = 0.00; IRR 1.04; 95%, 1.03\u20131.06), respectively. The number of oocytes collected (p = 0.007; OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.10), the number of blastocysts biopsied (p = 0.001; OR 1.14; 95% 95% CI 1.06\u20131.23) and the number of suitable embryos to transfer (p = 0.00; OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.17\u20131.64) were all significantly associated with the odds of achieving a LB. There is a 14% and 38% increased chance of a LB per additional blastocyst biopsied and suitable embryo to transfer, respectively. Conclusions: PGT-M and PGT-SR outcomes are significantly associated with egg yield, number of blastocysts to biopsy and suitable embryos to transfer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blastocysts", "Chromosomal rearrangements", "Live birth", "Monogenic disorders", "Oocyte", "Preimplantation genetic testing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067173469", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"13605714400": {"Name": "Ben-Nagi J.", "AuthorID": "13605714400", "AffiliationID": "112820257", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health"}, "57209282605": {"Name": "Amer A.", "AuthorID": "57209282605", "AffiliationID": "112820257", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health"}, "6701662902": {"Name": "Serhal P.", "AuthorID": "6701662902", "AffiliationID": "112820257", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health"}, "57188666074": {"Name": "Jones B.", "AuthorID": "57188666074", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "36895827700": {"Name": "Naja R.", "AuthorID": "36895827700", "AffiliationID": "122685760", "AffiliationName": "IGENOMIX"}, "57216814291": {"Name": "Sunkara S.", "AuthorID": "57216814291", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Hospital, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "16067597500": {"Name": "SenGupta S.", "AuthorID": "16067597500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute for Women's Health"}}}
