Materials and Methods: Local ethics committee approval was obtained at all sites for this prospective, multicenter study. All subjects provided written informed consent. Twenty-six patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 32 healthy control subjects from four centers underwent structural and functional MR imaging, including a go/no-go task and neuropsychological assessment. Subtests of the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the performance with the functional MR imaging paradigm were used as estimates of IPS and EF. Activation of the thalamus and the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), thalamic volume, T2 lesion load, and age were used to explain IPS and EF in regression models. Results: Compared with control subjects, patients showed increased activation in a frontoparietal network, including both thalami, during the execution of the go/no-go task. Patients had decreased thalamic volume (P , .001). Among tested variables, thalamic volume (b = 0.606, P = .001), together with thalamic activation (b = 20.410, P = .022), were the best predictors of IPS and EF and helped explain 52.7% of the variance in IPS and EF. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of the combined use of functional and morphologic parameters to explain IPS and EF in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and confirms the central role of the thalamus as a relay station in executive functioning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Reaction Time", "Thalamus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986222583", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57073727400": {"Name": "Koini M.", "AuthorID": "57073727400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology"}, "6701753695": {"Name": "Ropele S.", "AuthorID": "6701753695", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology"}, "35722647600": {"Name": "Mancini L.", "AuthorID": "35722647600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102945505": {"Name": "Fazekas F.", "AuthorID": "7102945505", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology"}, "6602781849": {"Name": "Enzinger C.", "AuthorID": "6602781849", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Medical University of Graz"}, "7202268530": {"Name": "Filippi M.", "AuthorID": "7202268530", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "34973365100": {"Name": "Rocca M.A.", "AuthorID": "34973365100", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "6506051299": {"Name": "Valsasina P.", "AuthorID": "6506051299", "AffiliationID": "113679160", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit"}, "57193017272": {"Name": "Riccitelli G.", "AuthorID": "57193017272", "AffiliationID": "113679160", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit"}, "36092434000": {"Name": "Damjanovic D.", "AuthorID": "36092434000", "AffiliationID": "60068827, 60068815", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36010957200": {"Name": "Muhlert N.", "AuthorID": "36010957200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7102955116": {"Name": "Tedeschi G.", "AuthorID": "7102955116", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medical, Department of Surgical, Department of Neurologic, Metabolic and Aging Sciences, Second University of Naples"}, "56421492900": {"Name": "Gallo A.", "AuthorID": "56421492900", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medical, Department of Surgical, Department of Neurologic, Metabolic and Aging Sciences, Second University of Naples"}}}
