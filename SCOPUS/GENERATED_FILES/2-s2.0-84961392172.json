The latter is defined as responding ethically and uniquely to encounters with difference. Uses of educational psychology often circumscribe \u2018challenge\u2019 to avoid risk and promote predictability; a riskier, wilder conception is proposed instead through a \u2018pedagogy of challenge\u2019. It is shown that course participants reflected on their most difficult moments, most of which ended in failure and dispute, as their most powerful and memorable learning experiences. Implications for schools and classrooms are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conflict", "Dispositions for learning", "Dissonance", "Failure", "Pedagogy of challenge", "Responsible leadership"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961392172", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"57213124874": {"Name": "Higham R.", "AuthorID": "57213124874", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge"}}}
