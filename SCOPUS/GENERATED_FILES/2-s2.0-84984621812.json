Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a fatty acid amide that is produced in many cells in the body, is thought to potentiate the action of endocannabinoids and to reduce pain and inflammation. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel multicenter study was performed to investigate the effect of ultramicronized PEA (PEA-um) as add-on therapy on neuropathic pain in individuals with SCI. A pain diary was completed and questionnaires were completed before and after the 12-week treatment with either placebo or PEA-um. The primary outcome measure was the change in mean neuropathic pain intensity from the 1-week baseline period to the last week of treatment measured on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10. The primary efficacy analysis was the intention to treat (baseline observation carried forward). Secondary outcomes included a per protocol analysis and effects on spasticity, evoked pain, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, and global impression of change. We randomized 73 individuals with neuropathic pain due to SCI, of which 5 had a major protocol violation, and thus 68 were included in the primary analysis. There was no difference in mean pain intensity between PEA-um and placebo treatment (P 0.46, mean reductions in pain scores 0.4 (-0.1 to 0.9) vs 0.7 (0.2-1.2); difference of means 0.3 (-0.4 to 0.9)). There was also no effect of PEA-um as add-on therapy on spasticity, insomnia, or psychological functioning. PEA was not associated with more adverse effects than placebo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neuropathic pain", "PEA", "Randomized controlled trial", "Spasticity", "Spinal cord injury", "Ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Analgesics", "Analysis of Variance", "Double-Blind Method", "Ethanolamines", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuralgia", "Palmitic Acids", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984621812", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57188811093": {"Name": "Andresen S.R.", "AuthorID": "57188811093", "AffiliationID": "60008172", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Centre of Western Denmark, Department of Neurology, Regional Hospital of Viborg"}, "55207679000": {"Name": "Hansen R.M.", "AuthorID": "55207679000", "AffiliationID": "60008172", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Centre of Western Denmark, Department of Neurology, Regional Hospital of Viborg"}, "6505893866": {"Name": "Johannesen I.L.", "AuthorID": "6505893866", "AffiliationID": "60008172", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Centre of Western Denmark, Department of Neurology, Regional Hospital of Viborg"}, "7102650186": {"Name": "Hagen E.M.", "AuthorID": "7102650186", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}, "24502666000": {"Name": "Bing J.", "AuthorID": "24502666000", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Spinal Cord Injuries, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7006000013": {"Name": "Biering-S\u00f8rensen F.", "AuthorID": "7006000013", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Spinal Cord Injuries, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "16167172300": {"Name": "Rice A.S.C.", "AuthorID": "16167172300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Pain Research, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College"}, "7404066238": {"Name": "Nielsen J.F.", "AuthorID": "7404066238", "AffiliationID": "105732964", "AffiliationName": "Hammel Neurorehabilitation and Research Centre"}, "7202286447": {"Name": "Bach F.W.", "AuthorID": "7202286447", "AffiliationID": "60015555", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Aalborg University Hospital"}, "6602356757": {"Name": "Finnerup N.B.", "AuthorID": "6602356757", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Danish Pain Research Center, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}}}
