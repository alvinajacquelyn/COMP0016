The model uses the smallness of the satellite pitch and roll angles, and the limited range of satellite altitude to provide a semianalytical echo model, whose numerical dimensions are limited to two in the synthetic aperture case or three in the interferometric case at large roll angles, making its application to extensive data practical. By not implementing the synthetic beam formation, it is demonstrated that the model recovers the conventional case of a pulse-limited altimeter. A theoretical description of the fluctuations in the multilooked, interferometric cross-product, and the synthetic aperture and pulse-limited powers is given by extending the model to describe correlations between individual looks in each case. The model offers the potential to retrieve ocean-surface parameters from synthetic aperture and pulse-limited altimeter data simultaneously, with obvious application to the new generation of altimeters onboard CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, and Sentinel-6 during the transition to operational synthetic aperture radar altimetry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geophysical sea measurements", "ocean surface", "radar altimetry", "radar remote sensing", "spaceborne radar", "synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna measurement", "Apertures", "Ocean surfaces", "Oceans", "Radar altimetry", "Radar remote sensing", "Sea measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041197612", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57207526004": {"Name": "Wingham D.", "AuthorID": "57207526004", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "Natural Environment Research Council"}, "57205888292": {"Name": "Giles K.", "AuthorID": "57205888292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "25654884600": {"Name": "Galin N.", "AuthorID": "25654884600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55966845700": {"Name": "Armitage T.", "AuthorID": "55966845700", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "15749968900": {"Name": "Cullen R.", "AuthorID": "15749968900", "AffiliationID": "60031159", "AffiliationName": "ESA-ESTEC"}, "25926741400": {"Name": "Smith W.", "AuthorID": "25926741400", "AffiliationID": "60027716", "AffiliationName": "NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry"}}}
