Specific considerations concerning the choice of mesh, element type, time step, and analysis method are required to ensure stable and accurate simulations. Modeling considerations and validation against experimental results are shown for two examples of increasing complexity. The approximation of complex geometries and the effects on guided wave propagation are discussed. Examples concerning guided wave scattering at defects in single and multiple metallic layers of plate structures were compared against experimental results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite Element Analysis", "Lamb Waves", "Scattering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis method", "Complex geometries", "Element models", "Element type", "Metallic layers", "Plate structure", "Time step", "Wave scattering"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069789645", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"23977809500": {"Name": "Fromme P.", "AuthorID": "23977809500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
