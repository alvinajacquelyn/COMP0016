Yet, people in the UK seem to feel positive when thinking about hot weather. According to research on the affect heuristic, any positive or negative emotions evoked by potentially risky experiences may be used as cues to inform concerns about risk protection. If so, then their positive feelings toward hot weather might lead UK residents to lower intentions to adopt heat protection behaviors. Here, we examine the relationships between heat protection behaviors during the July 2013 UK heat wave and self-reports of having heard heat protection recommendations, feeling positive affect about heat, seeing heat protection measures as effective, and trusting the organizations making those recommendations. Responses to a national survey revealed that 55.1% of participants had heard heat protection recommendations during the 2013 UK heat wave. Those who reported having heard recommendations also indicated having implemented more heat protection behaviors, perceiving heat protection behaviors as more effective, feeling more positive about heat, and intending to implement more protection behaviors in future hot summers. Mediation analyses suggested that heat protection recommendations may motivate heat protection behaviors by increasing their perceived effectiveness, but undermine their implementation by evoking positive affect about hot weather. We discuss our findings in the context of the affect heuristic and its implications for heat protection communications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affect heuristic", "Emotions", "Heat waves", "Protective behavior", "Risk communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Awareness", "Climate Change", "Extreme Heat", "Female", "Great Britain", "Heat Stress Disorders", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Media", "Middle Aged", "Seasons", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921657624", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"54911703000": {"Name": "Lefevre C.E.", "AuthorID": "54911703000", "AffiliationID": "60116344", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Decision Research, Leeds University Business School"}, "7004764268": {"Name": "Bruine de Bruin W.", "AuthorID": "7004764268", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "56197299000": {"Name": "Taylor A.L.", "AuthorID": "56197299000", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60159832", "AffiliationName": "Sustainability Research Institute and ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7004721990": {"Name": "Fischhoff B.", "AuthorID": "7004721990", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "6601974756": {"Name": "Dessai S.", "AuthorID": "6601974756", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60159832", "AffiliationName": "Sustainability Research Institute and ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57206360561": {"Name": "Kovats S.", "AuthorID": "57206360561", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
