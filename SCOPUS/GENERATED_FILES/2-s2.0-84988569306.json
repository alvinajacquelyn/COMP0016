Different concealment strategies such as packing compression, polymorphic encryption and metamorphic obfuscation have produced that malware Analysts need to find more original techniques to discriminate whether a file is malware or not. One of the current benchmark techniques is static analysis of API Calls. This technique aims to detect malware using the API Calls information extracted from the malware files. In this work, we aim to show a complete study of this technique using a behavioural model, built through an evolutionary process, in order to define possible limitations. For this analysis we will use a benchmark dataset to study the discrimination between malware and benignware and evaluate how malware writers are trying to imitate benign behaviour in order to defeat this technique.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural models", "Clustering", "Evolutionary computation", "Genetic algorithms", "Malware"], "IndexKeywords": ["API calls", "Behavioural model", "Benchmark datasets", "Clustering", "Evolutionary process", "Malware detection", "Malware writers"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988569306", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57143182900": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn A.", "AuthorID": "57143182900", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7003774102": {"Name": "Camacho D.", "AuthorID": "7003774102", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "42661760100": {"Name": "Men\u00e9ndez H.", "AuthorID": "42661760100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
