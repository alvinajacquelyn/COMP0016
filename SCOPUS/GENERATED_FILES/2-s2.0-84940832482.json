Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center.Background: Given the evidence that reasoning biases contribute to delusional persistence and change, several research groups have made systematic efforts to modify them. The current experiment tested the hypothesis that targeting reasoning biases would result in change in delusions. Methods: One hundred and one participants with current delusions and schizophrenia spectrum psychosis were randomly allocated to a brief computerized reasoning training intervention or to a control condition involving computer-based activities of similar duration. The primary hypotheses tested were that the reasoning training intervention, would improve (1) data gathering and belief flexibility and (2) delusional thinking, specifically paranoia. We then tested whether the changes in paranoia were mediated by changes in data gathering and flexibility, and whether working memory and negative symptoms moderated any intervention effects. Results: On an intention-to-treat analysis, there were significant improvements in state paranoia and reasoning in the experimental compared with the control condition. There was evidence that changes in reasoning mediated changes in paranoia, although this effect fell just outside the conventional level of significance after adjustment for baseline confounders. Working memory and negative symptoms significantly moderated the effects of the intervention on reasoning. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of a brief reasoning intervention in improving both reasoning processes and paranoia. It thereby provides proof-of-concept evidence that reasoning is a promising intermediary target in interventions to ameliorate delusions, and thus supports the value of developing this approach as a longer therapeutic intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["belief flexibility", "jumping to conclusions", "mediators", "psychosis", "reasoning biases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognitive Therapy", "Delusions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Middle Aged", "Paranoid Disorders", "Thinking", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940832482", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004167371": {"Name": "Garety P.", "AuthorID": "7004167371", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, P077 Henry Wellcome Building"}, "37073443500": {"Name": "Waller H.", "AuthorID": "37073443500", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, P077 Henry Wellcome Building"}, "9332406200": {"Name": "Jolley S.", "AuthorID": "9332406200", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, P077 Henry Wellcome Building"}, "16064103300": {"Name": "Kuipers E.", "AuthorID": "16064103300", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, P077 Henry Wellcome Building"}, "8531638500": {"Name": "Hardy A.", "AuthorID": "8531638500", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, P077 Henry Wellcome Building"}, "25521336700": {"Name": "Emsley R.", "AuthorID": "25521336700", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biostatistics, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7202885944": {"Name": "Dunn G.", "AuthorID": "7202885944", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biostatistics, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "57204025589": {"Name": "Bebbington P.", "AuthorID": "57204025589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7203066856": {"Name": "Fowler D.", "AuthorID": "7203066856", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57202665457": {"Name": "Freeman D.", "AuthorID": "57202665457", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Oxford University"}}}
