Despite recent improvements in their management, UC remain an aggressive disease associated with a poor outcome. Following disease progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, very few effective treatment options are available and none of them have shown significant improvement in overall survival. Alterations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway including amplification, mutations and overexpression are common in UC. Pre-clinical data suggest that the presence of such dysregulations may confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. Materials and methods: We present here the case of a patient with a metastatic UC of the renal pelvis with lymph node metastases treated with the selective FGFR inhibitor AZD4547. Results: To date, the patient has been on a study drug for 32 months with acceptable tolerance and maintained radiological partial response as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Exploratory biomarker analysis showed FGFR3, FGFR1, FGF-ligand and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) expression in the patient's tumour, together with the presence of a germ-line mutation in the FGFR3 extracellular binding domain. This is not a known hotspot mutation, and the functional significance remains unclear. Conclusions: The FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 exhibits antitumour activity in a metastatic urothelial cancer displaying FGFR1, FGFR3, FGF-ligand and FRS2 expression. This lends support to the further exploration of FGFR inhibitors in urothelial cancer. Further studies are required to determinate the most effective way to select those patients most likely to respond.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AZD4547", "Biomarker", "FGFR", "Urothelial cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Benzamides", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Kidney Pelvis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Piperazines", "Pyrazoles", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3", "Signal Transduction", "Ureteral Neoplasms", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944705426", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55780021900": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Vida A.", "AuthorID": "55780021900", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Hospital del Mar"}, "56468627300": {"Name": "Hughes S.", "AuthorID": "56468627300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25422700400": {"Name": "Rudman S.", "AuthorID": "25422700400", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8654568500": {"Name": "Chowdhury S.", "AuthorID": "8654568500", "AffiliationID": "112801215", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Research Institute UK"}, "24073280600": {"Name": "Saggese M.", "AuthorID": "24073280600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "6603300234": {"Name": "Arkenau H.T.", "AuthorID": "6603300234", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "55456165600": {"Name": "Smith N.R.", "AuthorID": "55456165600", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca"}, "56911847600": {"Name": "Lawrence P.", "AuthorID": "56911847600", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca"}, "55195114200": {"Name": "Rooney C.", "AuthorID": "55195114200", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca"}, "56911970700": {"Name": "Landers D.", "AuthorID": "56911970700", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca"}, "7003811560": {"Name": "Kilgour E.", "AuthorID": "7003811560", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca"}, "56613044000": {"Name": "Dougherty B.", "AuthorID": "56613044000", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca"}}}
