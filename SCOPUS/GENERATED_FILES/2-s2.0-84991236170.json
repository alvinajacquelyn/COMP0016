Karger AG, Basel.Several lines of evidence over the last few years have been important in ascertaining that the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region could be considered as a potential target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat freezing and other problems as part of a spectrum of gait disorders in Parkinson disease and other akinetic movement disorders. Since the introduction of PPN DBS, a variety of clinical studies have been published. Most indicate improvements in freezing and falls in patients who are severely affected by these problems. The results across patients, however, have been variable, perhaps reflecting patient selection, heterogeneity in target selection and differences in surgical methodology and stimulation settings. Here we outline both the accumulated knowledge and the domains of uncertainty in surgical anatomy and terminology. Specific topics were assigned to groups of experts, and this work was accumulated and reviewed by the executive committee of the working group. Areas of disagreement were discussed and modified accordingly until a consensus could be reached. We demonstrate that both the anatomy and the functional role of the PPN region need further study. The borders of the PPN and of adjacent nuclei differ when different brainstem atlases and atlas slices are compared. It is difficult to delineate precisely the PPN pars dissipata from the nucleus cuneiformis, as these structures partially overlap. This lack of clarity contributes to the difficulty in targeting and determining the exact localization of the electrodes implanted in patients with akinetic gait disorders. Future clinical studies need to consider these issues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anatomy", "Brainstem", "Deep brain stimulation", "Parkinson disease", "Pedunculopontine nucleus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deep Brain Stimulation", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease", "Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus", "Terminology as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991236170", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6701719662": {"Name": "Hamani C.", "AuthorID": "6701719662", "AffiliationID": "60111032, 60015765", "AffiliationName": "Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute"}, "7103406724": {"Name": "Lozano A.M.", "AuthorID": "7103406724", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60002401", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "34569976100": {"Name": "Hutchison W.", "AuthorID": "34569976100", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60002401", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "24923930200": {"Name": "Rughani A.", "AuthorID": "24923930200", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60002401", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "7102677271": {"Name": "Aziz T.", "AuthorID": "7102677271", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "57196768210": {"Name": "Pereira E.", "AuthorID": "57196768210", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7006266167": {"Name": "Bloem B.R.", "AuthorID": "7006266167", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57196955203": {"Name": "Brown P.", "AuthorID": "57196955203", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "6602112182": {"Name": "Chabardes S.", "AuthorID": "6602112182", "AffiliationID": "60005851, 60011447, 60104653, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery-CHU, Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences-INSERM U836 CEA-UJF-CHU, University Joseph Fourier"}, "35573094000": {"Name": "Goetz L.", "AuthorID": "35573094000", "AffiliationID": "60005851, 60011447, 60104653, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery-CHU, Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences-INSERM U836 CEA-UJF-CHU, University Joseph Fourier"}, "7006535094": {"Name": "Foote K.", "AuthorID": "7006535094", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Florida"}, "35563282500": {"Name": "Garcia-Rill E.", "AuthorID": "35563282500", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "7201435249": {"Name": "Hirsch E.C.", "AuthorID": "7201435249", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60120341", "AffiliationName": "Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle \u00c9pini\u00e8re, ICM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s"}, "7006263599": {"Name": "Mazzone P.A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006263599", "AffiliationID": "60110738", "AffiliationName": "OU for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, ASLRMC-CTO Hospital"}, "57203086773": {"Name": "Okun M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203086773", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "University of Florida Center for Movement Disorders, Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36832235000": {"Name": "Coyne T.", "AuthorID": "36832235000", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60110780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland"}, "6701568670": {"Name": "Silburn P.", "AuthorID": "6701568670", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60110780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7401492756": {"Name": "Alam M.", "AuthorID": "7401492756", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Medical School Hannover"}, "7202204228": {"Name": "Krauss J.K.", "AuthorID": "7202204228", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Medical School Hannover"}, "26041154000": {"Name": "Thevathasan W.", "AuthorID": "26041154000", "AffiliationID": "109899520", "AffiliationName": "Bionics Institute of Australia"}, "7005409218": {"Name": "Moro E.", "AuthorID": "7005409218", "AffiliationID": "60005851, 60104653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-CHU, University Joseph Fourier"}}}
