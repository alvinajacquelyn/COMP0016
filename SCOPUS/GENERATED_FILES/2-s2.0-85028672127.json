It is important to learn from established examples and define the components and intensity of services that provide good value for money. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of EIS according to how closely they adhered to the recommendations of the English Department of Health 2001 Policy Implementation Guide (PIG). Methods: EIS from the National Eden Study were assessed using a measure of fidelity to the PIG that rated the presence or absence of 64 recommended items relating to team structure and practice. EIS were then classified into three groups: those with fidelity of 75\u201380%, 81\u201390% and 91\u201395%. Patient-level resource use and outcomes were measured 1 year following inception into the service; costs were calculated and combined with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Results: At a threshold of \u00a320 000 per QALY, the 81\u201390% fidelity group had a 56.3% likelihood of being the most cost-effective option followed by 75\u201380% fidelity at 35.8% and 91\u201395% fidelity group (7.9%). Conclusions: The results from England suggest that striving to maximize fidelity may not be warranted, but that dropping below a certain level of fidelity may result in inefficient use of resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["costs and cost analysis", "early medical intervention", "economic evaluation", "psychotic disorders", "quality-adjusted life years"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Early Medical Intervention", "England", "Guideline Adherence", "Health Care Costs", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Psychotic Disorders", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028672127", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7004745317": {"Name": "Radhakrishnan M.", "AuthorID": "7004745317", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College"}, "7003937597": {"Name": "McCrone P.", "AuthorID": "7003937597", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College"}, "6602247618": {"Name": "Lafortune L.", "AuthorID": "6602247618", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55780653300": {"Name": "Everard L.", "AuthorID": "55780653300", "AffiliationID": "60099531", "AffiliationName": "The Early Intervention Service, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7203066856": {"Name": "Fowler D.", "AuthorID": "7203066856", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "7003468422": {"Name": "Amos T.", "AuthorID": "7003468422", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Psychiatry, University of Bristol"}, "7006066134": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "7006066134", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57202910558": {"Name": "Singh S.P.", "AuthorID": "57202910558", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7402449340": {"Name": "Marshall M.", "AuthorID": "7402449340", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60016726", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "55635993400": {"Name": "Birchwood M.", "AuthorID": "55635993400", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60016726", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "57220762644": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "57220762644", "AffiliationID": "60102026", "AffiliationName": "Early Intervention Service, Cheshire and Wirral NHS Foundation Trust & University of Chester"}, "55565627800": {"Name": "Lavis A.", "AuthorID": "55565627800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "56489064900": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "56489064900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}}}
