For the first time, supercapacitor components have been integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB) construct. This proof-of-concept study paves the way for integrating supercapacitors into power electronics devices and hybridising with PCB fuel cells. Commercial Norit activated carbon (NAC) was used as the electrode material and was tested in two types of electrolytes, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) aqueous electrolyte, and Na2SO4-polyvinyl alcohol (Na2SO4-PVA) gel electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements compare the SC-PCBs to standard two-electrode button-cell supercapacitors. A volumetric energy density of 0.56 mW h cm\u22123 at a power density of 26 mW cm\u22123 was obtained in the solid-state SC-PCB system, which is over twice the values acquired in the standard cell configuration. This is due to the removal of bulky components in the standard cell, and/or decreased thickness of the overall device, and thus a decrease in the total volume of the SC-PCB configuration. The results show great potential for embedding supercapacitors into PCBs for a broad range of applications. In addition, further advantages can be realised through close physical integration with other PCB-based electrochemical power systems such as fuel cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activated carbon", "Hybrid systems", "Integrated energy storage", "Printed circuit board", "Supercapacitor", "Wearable power systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous electrolyte", "Electrochemical measurements", "Electrochemical power", "Integrated energy storages", "Portable electronics", "Power electronics devices", "Printed circuit boards (PCB)", "Volumetric energy densities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049602497", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57202854549": {"Name": "Abouelamaiem D.", "AuthorID": "57202854549", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57201197910": {"Name": "Rasha L.", "AuthorID": "57201197910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "42061920200": {"Name": "Millichamp J.", "AuthorID": "42061920200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55324237200": {"Name": "Mason T.", "AuthorID": "55324237200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005222072": {"Name": "Jorge A.", "AuthorID": "7005222072", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6506809216": {"Name": "Titirici M.", "AuthorID": "6506809216", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Functional Nanomaterials, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London"}, "26436412000": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "26436412000", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Institute of Chemical Engineering"}, "12802385800": {"Name": "Ji S.", "AuthorID": "12802385800", "AffiliationID": "60073560", "AffiliationName": "College of Biological, Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Jiaxing University"}}}
