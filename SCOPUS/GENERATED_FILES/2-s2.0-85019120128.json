However, a broad class of real-world signals have a high-frequency slope, like fBm, but a plateau in the vicinity of zero frequency. This low-frequency plateau, it is shown, implies that the temporal integral of the process exhibits diffusive behavior, dispersing from its initial location at a constant rate. Such processes are not well modeled by fBm, which has a singularity at zero frequency corresponding to an unbounded rate of dispersion. A more appropriate stochastic model is a much lesser-known random process called the Mat\u00e9rn process, which is shown herein to be a damped version of fractional Brownian motion. This article first provides a thorough introduction to fractional Brownian motion, then examines the details of the Mat\u00e9rn process and its relationship to fBm. An algorithm for the simulation of the Mat\u00e9rn process in <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><i>log</i><i>N</i>) operations is given. Unlike fBm, the Mat\u00e9rn process is found to provide an excellent match to modeling velocities from particle trajectories in an application to two-dimensional fluid turbulence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019120128", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"8790086900": {"Name": "Lilly J.", "AuthorID": "8790086900", "AffiliationID": "60016155", "AffiliationName": "NorthWest Research Assoc."}, "57189059791": {"Name": "Early J.", "AuthorID": "57189059791", "AffiliationID": "60016155", "AffiliationName": "NorthWest Research Assoc."}, "36447846900": {"Name": "Sykulski A.", "AuthorID": "36447846900", "AffiliationID": "60117771, 60117616, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Data Science Institute, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "6507545514": {"Name": "Olhede S.", "AuthorID": "6507545514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
