A photoelectrochemical (PEC) device would therefore play a key role in offering the possibility of carbon-neutral solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis. The past five years have seen a surge in the development of promising semiconductor materials. In addition, low-cost earth-abundant co-catalysts are ubiquitous in their employment in water splitting cells due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This review commences with a fundamental understanding of semiconductor properties and charge transfer processes in a PEC device. We then describe various configurations of PEC devices, including single light-absorber cells and multi light-absorber devices (PEC, PV-PEC and PV/electrolyser tandem cell). Recent progress on both photoelectrode materials (light absorbers) and electrocatalysts is summarized, and important factors which dominate photoelectrode performance, including light absorption, charge separation and transport, surface chemical reaction rate and the stability of the photoanode, are discussed. Controlling semiconductor properties is the primary concern in developing materials for solar water splitting. Accordingly, strategies to address the challenges for materials development in this area, such as the adoption of smart architectures, innovative device configuration design, co-catalyst loading, and surface protection layer deposition, are outlined throughout the text, to deliver a highly efficient and stable PEC device for water splitting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026634838", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56329410000": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "56329410000", "AffiliationID": "60015742, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35722558900": {"Name": "Moniz S.J.A.", "AuthorID": "35722558900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205469410": {"Name": "Wang A.", "AuthorID": "57205469410", "AffiliationID": "60015742, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56158944400": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "56158944400", "AffiliationID": "60015742, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
