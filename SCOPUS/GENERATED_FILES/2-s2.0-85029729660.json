We investigated whether higher levels of physical activity and lower levels of sedentary behaviour were associated with lower odds of low kidney function in older men. Methods: cross-sectional study of 1,352 men from the British Regional Heart Study, mean (standard deviation) age 78.5 (4.6) year. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were measured using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Kidney function was measured by estimated Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the chronic kidney disease-EPI creatinine-cystatin equation. Associations between physical (in)activity and kidney function were investigated using regression models. Results: higher levels of physical activity and lower levels of sedentary behaviour were associated with reduced odds ratios (ORs) for lower eGFR ( < 45 versus \u226545 ml/min per 1.73 m2) after adjustment for covariates. Each additional 1,000 steps, 30 min of light physical activity and 10 min of moderate/vigorous physical activity per day were associated with a lower odds (95% confidence interval (CI)) of a low eGFR; OR 0.81 (0.73, 0.91), OR 0.87 (0.78, 0.97) and OR 0.84 (0.76, 0.92), respectively. Each additional 30 min of sedentary behaviour per day was associated with a higher odds of a low eGFR (1.16 95% CI 1.06, 1.27). Associations between moderate/vigorous physical activity and lower kidney function persisted after adjustment for light physical activity or sedentary behaviour. Conclusion: physical activity is associated with kidney function in older men and could be of public health importance in this group who are at increased risk of poor kidney function and low physical activity. More evidence is needed on whether the association is causal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glomerular filtration rate", "Kidney function", "Older people", "Physical activity", "Sedentary behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actigraphy", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Biomarkers", "Creatinine", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cystatin C", "Exercise", "Fitness Trackers", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Diseases", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Odds Ratio", "Protective Factors", "Risk Factors", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Sex Factors", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029729660", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57169774400": {"Name": "Parsons T.J.", "AuthorID": "57169774400", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Goya Wannamethee S.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7404437968": {"Name": "Lee I.M.", "AuthorID": "7404437968", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}}}
