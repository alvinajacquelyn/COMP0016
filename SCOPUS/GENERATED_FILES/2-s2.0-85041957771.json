Results: Individual data from 10 studies were included. From a total of 3271 patients, 604 patients (18%) were \u2265 70 years (median 73 years, range 70-88). Of these, 335 patients were treated with a bevacizumab-based first-line regimen and 265 were treated with chemotherapy only. The median PFS was 8.2 vs. 6.5 months and the median OS was 16.7 vs. 13.0 months in patients treated with and without bevacizumab, respectively. The safety profile of bevacizumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy did not differ from published clinical trials. Materials and Methods: PubMed and Cochrane Library searches were performed on 29 April 2013 and studies published to this date were included. Authors were contacted to request progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) data, patient data on treatment regimens, age, sex and potential signs of toxicity in patients \u2265 70 years of age. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the addition of bevacizumab to standard first-line chemotherapy improves clinical outcome in elderly patients with mCRC and is well tolerated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bevacizumab", "Elderly", "First-line chemotherapy", "Metastatic colorectal cancer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041957771", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56353514900": {"Name": "Koch C.", "AuthorID": "56353514900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Liver and Cancer Centre"}, "57200626155": {"Name": "Schwing A.M.", "AuthorID": "57200626155", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Liver and Cancer Centre"}, "7103125178": {"Name": "Zeuzem S.", "AuthorID": "7103125178", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Liver and Cancer Centre"}, "18736761800": {"Name": "Trojan J.", "AuthorID": "18736761800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Liver and Cancer Centre"}, "55994026700": {"Name": "Herrmann E.", "AuthorID": "55994026700", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biostatistics and Mathematical Modelling, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University"}, "7007085550": {"Name": "Borner M.", "AuthorID": "7007085550", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Medical Oncology Institute, Inselspital"}, "6701333643": {"Name": "Diaz-Rubio E.", "AuthorID": "6701333643", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos"}, "35733543500": {"Name": "Dotan E.", "AuthorID": "35733543500", "AffiliationID": "60009389", "AffiliationName": "Fox Chase Cancer Center"}, "8161225000": {"Name": "Feliu J.", "AuthorID": "8161225000", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, La Paz University Hospital, CIBERONC"}, "24577252300": {"Name": "Okita N.", "AuthorID": "24577252300", "AffiliationID": "60022755", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Center"}, "55907518900": {"Name": "Souglakos J.", "AuthorID": "55907518900", "AffiliationID": "60011303, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete"}, "6603300234": {"Name": "Arkenau H.T.", "AuthorID": "6603300234", "AffiliationID": "109697477", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Research Institute"}, "55530099300": {"Name": "Porschen R.", "AuthorID": "55530099300", "AffiliationID": "60008076", "AffiliationName": "Klinikum Bremen Ost"}, "24587826200": {"Name": "Koopman M.", "AuthorID": "24587826200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre"}, "7004571924": {"Name": "Punt C.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004571924", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7103388476": {"Name": "de Gramont A.", "AuthorID": "7103388476", "AffiliationID": "112618913", "AffiliationName": "L'Institut Hospitalier Franco-Britannique"}, "55762423400": {"Name": "Tournigand C.", "AuthorID": "55762423400", "AffiliationID": "60023970, 60025066", "AffiliationName": "University of Paris Est Creteil, Henri-Mondor Hospital"}}}
