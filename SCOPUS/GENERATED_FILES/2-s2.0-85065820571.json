Published by BMJ.Objective: To investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurogranin concentrations are altered in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), comparatively with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and associated with neuronal degeneration in brain tissue. Methods: CSF neurogranin, total tau, neurofilament light (NFL) and 14-3-3 protein were measured in neurological controls (NCs, n=64), AD (n=46) and CJD (n=81). The accuracy of neurogranin discriminating the three diagnostic groups was evaluated. Correlations between neurogranin and neurodegeneration biomarkers, demographic, genetic and clinical data were assessed. Additionally, neurogranin expression in postmortem brain tissue was studied. Results: Compared with NC, CSF neurogranin concentrations were increased in CJD (4.75 times of NC; p<0.001, area under curve (AUC), 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99) and AD (1.94 times of NC; p<0.01, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.82), and were able to differentiate CJD from AD (p<0.001, AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.92). CSF tau was increased in CJD (41 times of NC) and in AD (3.1 times of NC), both at p<0.001. In CJD, neurogranin positively correlated with tau (r=0.55, p<0.001) and was higher in 14-3-3-positivity (p<0.05), but showed no association with NFL (r=0.08, p=0.46). CJD-MM1/MV1 cases displayed higher neurogranin levels than VV2 cases. Neurogranin was increased at early CJD disease stages and was a good prognostic marker of survival time in CJD. In brain tissue, neurogranin was detected in the cytoplasm, membrane and postsynaptic density fractions of neurons, with reduced levels in AD, and more significantly in CJD, where they correlated with synaptic and axonal markers. Conclusions: Neurogranin is a new biomarker of prion pathogenesis with diagnostic and prognostic abilities, which reflects the degree of neuronal damage in brain tissue in a CJD subtype manner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alzheimer's disease", "cerebrospinal fluid", "creutzfeldt-jakob disease", "neurodegenerative dementias", "neurofilament light", "neurogranin", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["14-3-3 Proteins", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neurogranin", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065820571", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "121484674", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "57195297409": {"Name": "Diaz-Lucena D.", "AuthorID": "57195297409", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Institute Carlos III, Ministry of Health, l'Hospilatet Del Llobregat"}, "6506191030": {"Name": "Ferrer Abizanda I.", "AuthorID": "6506191030", "AffiliationID": "60011805, 60025847", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institutue (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat"}, "36972511000": {"Name": "Llorens F.", "AuthorID": "36972511000", "AffiliationID": "60011805, 60025847", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institutue (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat"}, "36621479400": {"Name": "Villar-Pique A.", "AuthorID": "36621479400", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "18434019500": {"Name": "Hermann P.", "AuthorID": "18434019500", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "15844268800": {"Name": "Schmitz M.", "AuthorID": "15844268800", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "8382301500": {"Name": "Zerr I.", "AuthorID": "8382301500", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "55917217700": {"Name": "Karch A.", "AuthorID": "55917217700", "AffiliationID": "60012279", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"}, "8652854100": {"Name": "Vidal E.", "AuthorID": "8652854100", "AffiliationID": "60031261, 60006313, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "IRTA, Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA, IRTA-UAB), Campus de la Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}}}
