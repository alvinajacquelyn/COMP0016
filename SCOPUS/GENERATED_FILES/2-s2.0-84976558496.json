Four hundred and fifty-one (50 female) ambulance personnel completed three questionnaires as a part of a selection and development assessment. The study utilised the Hogan Development survey as a measure of dark side personality, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory to assess workrelated burnout, and the Resilience Scale- 14 to measure resilience levels. Those high on Excitable and Cautious but low on Bold and Reserved were linked to an increased vulnerability to Burnout. Also those high on Bold and Diligent yet low on the Excitable, Cautious, and Imaginative scales were more resilient. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that resilience plays both a mediating and moderating role on personality and burnout. Theoretical implications suggest future research assessing the predictive capacity of psychological variables on burnout should account the indirect effect of resilience.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Burnout, Professional", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Personality", "Resilience, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976558496", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56397159200": {"Name": "Treglown L.", "AuthorID": "56397159200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56568417900": {"Name": "Palaiou K.", "AuthorID": "56568417900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}, "57198863526": {"Name": "Zarola A.", "AuthorID": "57198863526", "AffiliationID": "116957301", "AffiliationName": "Zeal Solutions"}}}
