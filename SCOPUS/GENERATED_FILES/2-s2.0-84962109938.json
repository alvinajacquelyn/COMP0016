In early 1999 increased background seismicity and high SO2 readings suggested that magma was stirring. 2./The long-term participation of IGEPN scientists in both monitoring and volcanic studies has fostered an institutional memory and a knowledge base that is referential for providing early warnings and in aiding the authorities to make critical decisions in anticipation of dangerous volcanic behavior. 3./The permanent presence of IGEPN scientists at Tungurahua's Volcano Observatory (OVT) who oversee the monitoring operations and maintain close contact with the threatened community. 4./Participation of volunteer volcano observers from the community (vig\u00edas) who convey their observations 24 hours/day via a pan-volcano UHF radio system. Challenges to the operation's success include: Identifying precursor geophysical signals before volcanic eruptions begin; financing OVT's operations and real-time instrumental surveillance; assuring active involvement of experienced scientists at OVT; instructing new rotating public officials in volcanic hazards and volcano crisis management, as well as working alongside them during critical moments; maintaining positive working relations with the community. Here we report on volcano monitoring and risk reduction strategies that have served the IGEPN in a semi-rural environment, where ~30,000 people reside in high-risk zones. On reflection, we believe that our \"bottom-up\" approach has been effective and has merit. This approach developed gradually; our actions were in response to our instrumental monitoring activity of Tungurahua, providing credible information to the public and authorities and overcoming negative perceptions by the population. If there is a recipe, it is conditioned on good monitoring results and interpretation that is adequately and frequently communicated to those concerned, and over many years fostering a mutual trust among the actors. Some strategies described herein may not be pertinent at a volcano whose eruptive activity is short-lived.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early warnings before eruption", "Scientific-community relations", "Tungurahua volcano", "Vig\u00edas", "Volcano observatory", "Vulcanian eruptions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962109938", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"6603155100": {"Name": "Mothes P.A.", "AuthorID": "6603155100", "AffiliationID": "60072054", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Geof\u00edsico, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"}, "6603583513": {"Name": "Yepes H.A.", "AuthorID": "6603583513", "AffiliationID": "60072054", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Geof\u00edsico, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"}, "7403483234": {"Name": "Hall M.L.", "AuthorID": "7403483234", "AffiliationID": "60072054", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Geof\u00edsico, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"}, "16835212600": {"Name": "Ram\u00f3n P.A.", "AuthorID": "16835212600", "AffiliationID": "60072054", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Geof\u00edsico, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"}, "55902355400": {"Name": "Steele A.L.", "AuthorID": "55902355400", "AffiliationID": "60072054", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Geof\u00edsico, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"}, "57200218104": {"Name": "Ruiz M.C.", "AuthorID": "57200218104", "AffiliationID": "60072054", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Geof\u00edsico, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"}}}
