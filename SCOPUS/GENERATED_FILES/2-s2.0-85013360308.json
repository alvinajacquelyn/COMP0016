This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the prevalence of high levels of distress among oncologists. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol is registered at the PROSPERO international prospective register (ref. 2015:CRD42015016325). We categorised data items according to the following distress factors: burnout, psychiatric morbidity, stress, depression, disrupted sleep, stress-induced physical symptoms, and substance use. We meta-analysed the prevalence of burnout and psychiatric morbidity using random effects models with MetaXL software. Results: The meta-analyses showed that 32% of 4876 oncologists had high burnout (\u00b1CI 28%-36%) and 27% of 2384 had high psychiatric morbidity (\u00b1CI 23%-32%). Studies also showed that 42% to 69% feel stressed at work, >12% of oncologists screen positive for depression, many oncologists suffer from sleep deprivation, up to 30% drink alcohol in a problematic way, and up to 20% of junior oncologists use hypnotic drugs, and some frequently experience stress-induced complaints such as ulcers, gastric problems, headaches, and arrhythmia. Conclusions: Occupational distress reduces career satisfaction, affects patient care, and increases the chances of oncologists switching to another area of medicine; therefore, future research should explore appropriate interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["burnout", "cancer", "meta-analysis", "oncology", "psychiatric morbidity", "sleep", "stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alcohol Drinking", "Burnout, Professional", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Medical Oncology", "Neoplasms", "Oncologists", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Stress, Psychological", "Workload"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013360308", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56030474800": {"Name": "Medisauskaite A.", "AuthorID": "56030474800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organizational Psychology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "26027877600": {"Name": "Kamau C.", "AuthorID": "26027877600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organizational Psychology, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
