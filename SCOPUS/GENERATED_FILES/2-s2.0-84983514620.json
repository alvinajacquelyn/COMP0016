A novel classification of population survey data to inform epidemiological research and clinical practice", "Year": 2017, "Source": "Sex. Transm.

We identify a novel, empirical-based categorisation of partnership type, and examine whether reporting STI diagnoses varies by the resulting typologies. Methods Analyses of probability survey data collected from 15162 people aged 16-74 who participated in Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles were undertaken during 2010-2012. Computer-assisted self-interviews asked about participants' \u22643 most recent partners (N=14322 partners/past year). Analysis of variance and regression tested for differences in partnership duration and perceived likelihood of sex again across 21 'partnership progression types' (PPTs) derived from relationship status at first and most recent sex. Multivariable regression examined the association between reporting STI diagnoses and partnership type(s) net of age and reported partner numbers (all past year). Results The 21 PPTs were grouped into four summary types: 'cohabiting', 'now steady', 'casual' and 'ex-steady' according to the average duration and likelihood of sex again. 11 combinations of these summary types accounted for 94.5% of all men; 13 combinations accounted for 96.9% of all women. Reporting STI diagnoses varied by partnership-type combination, including after adjusting for age and partner numbers, for example, adjusted OR: 6.03 (95% CI 2.01 to 18.1) for men with two 'casual' and one 'now steady' partners versus men with one 'cohabiting' partner. Conclusions This typology provides an objective method for measuring partnership type and demonstrates its importance in understanding STI risk, net of partner numbers. Epidemiological research and clinical practice should use these methods and results to maximise individual and public health benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CONTACT TRACING", "EPIDEMIOLOGY (GENERAL)", "HEALTH SERV RESEARCH", "PARTNER NOTIFICATION", "SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Data Collection", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983514620", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57199313412": {"Name": "Jones K.G.", "AuthorID": "57199313412", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "24069384200": {"Name": "Tanton C.", "AuthorID": "24069384200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55616689100": {"Name": "Lewis R.", "AuthorID": "55616689100", "AffiliationID": "60013813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of the Pacific"}, "7202163725": {"Name": "Mitchell K.R.", "AuthorID": "7202163725", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, Institute of Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "38561449600": {"Name": "Gravningen K.", "AuthorID": "38561449600", "AffiliationID": "60105391", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital of North Norway"}, "57203069305": {"Name": "Cassell J.A.", "AuthorID": "57203069305", "AffiliationID": "60007919, 60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Brighton"}, "57205874518": {"Name": "Estcourt C.S.", "AuthorID": "57205874518", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Sexual Health Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
