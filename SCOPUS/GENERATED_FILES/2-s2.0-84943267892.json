Here, we review this literature, focusing on the contributions of hippocampal and striatal systems, and attempt to outline a minimal cognitive architecture that is consistent with the experimental literature and that synthesizes previous related computational modeling. The resulting architecture includes striatal reinforcement learning based on egocentric representations of sensory states and actions, incidental Hebbian association of sensory information with allocentric state representations in the hippocampus, and arbitration of the outputs of both systems based on confidence/uncertainty in medial prefrontal cortex. We discuss the relationship between this architecture and learning in model-free and model-based systems, episodic memory, imagery, and planning, including some open questions and directions for further experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Cognition", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Imagination", "Learning", "Memory, Episodic", "Neostriatum", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reinforcement (Psychology)", "Spatial Navigation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943267892", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"8360773500": {"Name": "Chersi F.", "AuthorID": "8360773500", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
