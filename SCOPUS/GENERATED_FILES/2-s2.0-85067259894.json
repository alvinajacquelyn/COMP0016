Here, we integrate mRNA sequencing, ribosome footprinting, polysomal RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry datasets from a mouse lymphoid cell model to characterize the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) associated ribosomal RPL10 R98S mutation. Surprisingly, RPL10 R98S induces changes in protein levels primarily through transcriptional rather than translation efficiency changes. Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), encoding a key serine biosynthesis enzyme, was the only gene with elevated transcription and translation leading to protein overexpression. PSPH upregulation is a general phenomenon in T-ALL patient samples, associated with elevated serine and glycine levels in xenograft mice. Reduction of PSPH expression suppresses proliferation of T-ALL cell lines and their capacity to expand in mice. We identify ribosomal mutation driven induction of serine biosynthesis and provide evidence supporting dependence of T-ALL cells on PSPH.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell
