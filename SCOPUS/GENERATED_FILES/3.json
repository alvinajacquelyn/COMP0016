LABOUR published by Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini and John Wiley & Sons LtdUsing data for British workplaces, we compare the associations between human resource management (HRM) practices and schools' performance, comparing those effects to the effects of HRM among private sector workplaces. We do so using measures of workplace performance that are common across all workplaces. We find intensive use of HRM practices is correlated with substantial improvement in workplace performance, both among schools and other workplaces. Results are robust to panel estimates of the correlation between changes in performance and changes in HRM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085609586", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, UCL"}, "55453846800": {"Name": "Wilkinson D.", "AuthorID": "55453846800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, UCL"}, "55453944500": {"Name": "Stokes L.", "AuthorID": "55453944500", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "NIESR"}}}
