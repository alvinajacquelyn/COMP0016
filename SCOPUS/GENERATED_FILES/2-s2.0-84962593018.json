In addition to differences in body mass, felid species show dietary and locomotory specializations that correlate to skull and limb osteological measurements, such as shape or cross-sectional area. However, ecological correlates to the axial skeleton are yet untested. Here, we build on previous studies of the biomechanical and morphological evolution of the felid appendicular skeleton by conducting a quantitative analysis of morphology and allometry in the presacral vertebral column across extant cats. Our results demonstrate that vertebral columns of arboreal, scansorial and terrestrial felids significantly differ in morphology, specifically in the lumbar region, while no distinction based on dietary specialization was found. Body size significantly influences vertebral morphology, with clear regionalization of allometry along the vertebral column, suggesting that anterior (cervicals and thoracics) and posterior (lumbar) vertebrae may be independently subjected to distinct selection pressures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Felidae", "locomotion", "morphology", "vertebral column"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962593018", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"55818394600": {"Name": "Randau M.", "AuthorID": "55818394600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "14068896700": {"Name": "Goswami A.", "AuthorID": "14068896700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "24738815600": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.", "AuthorID": "24738815600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences and Structure & Motion Laboratory, The Royal Veterinary College"}, "55984879200": {"Name": "Cuff A.", "AuthorID": "55984879200", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences and Structure & Motion Laboratory, The Royal Veterinary College"}, "24729574100": {"Name": "Pierce S.", "AuthorID": "24729574100", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Museum of Comparative Zoology and Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}}}
