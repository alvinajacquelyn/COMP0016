In conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera, we mailed 25,000 opera attendees a letter describing a charitable fundraising project organized by the opera house. Recipients were randomly assigned to treatments designed to explore responses to fundraising schemes varying in: the presence of a lead donor; and how individual donations would be matched using the lead donation. The structural model estimates extensive and intensive margin responses, and is then utilized to predict giving behavior in counterfactual fundraising schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928884950", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"56259645500": {"Name": "Huck S.", "AuthorID": "56259645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "12796887500": {"Name": "Rasul I.", "AuthorID": "12796887500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "15019880000": {"Name": "Shephard A.", "AuthorID": "15019880000", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania"}}}
