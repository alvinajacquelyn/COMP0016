The theoretical model is a modified version of Morrison's equation, valid for small floating bodies. The experimental model is implemented in a wave basin at a scale 1:100, using a thin plastic disc to model the floe. The processed experimental data display a regime change in surge amplitude when the incident wavelength is approximately twice the floe diameter. It is shown that the theoretical model is accurate in the high-wavelength regime, but highly inaccurate in the lowwavelength regime.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Sea-ice modelling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932647925", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"7006094962": {"Name": "Meylan M.H.", "AuthorID": "7006094962", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Physical Science, University of Newcastle"}, "56698387200": {"Name": "Yiew L.J.", "AuthorID": "56698387200", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "19933696800": {"Name": "Bennetts L.G.", "AuthorID": "19933696800", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.A.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "36154336700": {"Name": "French B.J.", "AuthorID": "36154336700", "AffiliationID": "60007015", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College"}}}
