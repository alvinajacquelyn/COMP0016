The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PI in PD remain elusive. This short review provides a critical summary of the literature on PI in PD, covering the clinical features, the neural and cognitive substrates, and the effects of dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation. The delayed effect of dopaminergic medication combined with the success of extrastriatal deep brain stimulation suggests that PI involves neurotransmitter systems other than dopamine and brain regions extending beyond the basal ganglia, further challenging the traditional view of PD as a predominantly single-system neurodegenerative disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep brain stimulation (DBS)", "dopamine", "extrastriatal system", "falls", "Parkinson's disease", "postural instability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accidental Falls", "Animals", "Basal Ganglia", "Brain", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978177186", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56712450000": {"Name": "Crouse J.J.", "AuthorID": "56712450000", "AffiliationID": "60017803", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences and Psychology, Western Sydney University"}, "56431786400": {"Name": "Phillips J.R.", "AuthorID": "56431786400", "AffiliationID": "60017803", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences and Psychology, Western Sydney University"}, "56875918400": {"Name": "Moustafa A.A.", "AuthorID": "56875918400", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "Marcs Institute for Brain and Behaviour, Western Sydney University"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Motor Neuroscience Group, Unit of Functional Neurosurgery Sobell, Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
