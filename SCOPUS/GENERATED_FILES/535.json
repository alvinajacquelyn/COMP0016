Yet the solar wind must ultimately remove plasma from these rapidly rotating magnetodiscs at the same rate that plasma is transported radially outward from the source regions: the Io and Enceladus plasma tori. It is not clear how the solar wind influences magnetospheric dynamics when the dynamics are dominated by rotation. However, auroral observations provide important clues. We review magnetodisc sources and radial transport and the solar wind interaction with the giant magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn in an attempt to connect auroral features with specific drivers. We provide a discussion of auroral signatures that are related to the solar wind interaction and summarize with a discussion of global magnetospheric dynamics as illustrated by global MHD simulations. Many questions remain and it is the intent of this review to highlight several of the most compelling questions for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aurora", "Dynamics", "Magnetodiscs", "Momentum loading", "Neutral clouds", "Plasma torus", "Reconnection", "Solar wind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aurora", "Global MHD simulation", "Magnetodiscs", "Magnetospheric dynamics", "Planetary rotation", "Plasma torus", "Reconnection", "Solar wind interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028207634", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"6603141904": {"Name": "Delamere P.", "AuthorID": "6603141904", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "8431596700": {"Name": "Bagenal F.", "AuthorID": "8431596700", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "6602411908": {"Name": "Paranicas C.", "AuthorID": "6602411908", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "23071073500": {"Name": "Masters A.", "AuthorID": "23071073500", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "14048953800": {"Name": "Radioti A.", "AuthorID": "14048953800", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "16425277400": {"Name": "Bonfond B.", "AuthorID": "16425277400", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "26022604500": {"Name": "Ray L.", "AuthorID": "26022604500", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "24724687600": {"Name": "Jia X.", "AuthorID": "24724687600", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "57203043672": {"Name": "Nichols J.", "AuthorID": "57203043672", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "8220350900": {"Name": "Arridge C.", "AuthorID": "8220350900", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute & Physics Department, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}}}
