However, because of the resources to collect, process and analyze data, it remains difficult to obtain large data sets for study. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, researchers have recently used mobile sensing, however this technique is currently only able to detect either stationary or moving crowds with questionable accuracy. In this work we present a system for detecting stationary interactions inside crowds using the Received Signal Strength Indicator of Bluetooth Smart (BLE) sensor, combined with the Motion Activity of each device. By utilizing Apple's iBeacon implementation of Bluetooth Smart, we are able to detect the proximity of users carrying a smartphone in their pocket. We then use an algorithm based on graph theory to predict interactions inside the crowd and verify our findings using video footage as ground truth. Our approach is particularly beneficial to the design and implementation of crowd behavior analytics, design of influence strategies, and algorithms for crowd reconfiguration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BLE", "Crowd Sensing", "Group Formations", "IBeacon", "Mobile Sensing", "RSSI", "Social Interactions", "Social Network Analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crowd Sensing", "Group formations", "IBeacon", "Mobile sensing", "RSSI", "Social interactions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991080558", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"56380446100": {"Name": "Katevas K.", "AuthorID": "56380446100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602852642": {"Name": "Tokarchuk L.", "AuthorID": "6602852642", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "24766186400": {"Name": "Haddadi H.", "AuthorID": "24766186400", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "56186242800": {"Name": "Clegg R.", "AuthorID": "56186242800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College"}}}
