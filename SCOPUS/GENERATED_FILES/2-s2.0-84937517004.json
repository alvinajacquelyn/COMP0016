This hypothesis was tested using the anti-epileptic drug sodium valproate, a known histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), utilizing a delayed-start study design in the lactacystin rat model of PD. Experimental Approach The irreversible proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was unilaterally injected into the substantia nigra of Sprague-Dawley rats that subsequently received valproate for 28 days starting 7 days after lactacystin lesioning. Longitudinal motor behavioural testing, structural MRI and post-mortem assessment of nigrostriatal integrity were used to track changes in this model of PD and quantify neuroprotection/restoration. Subsequent cellular and molecular analyses were performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying valproate's effects. Key Results Despite producing a distinct pattern of structural re-modelling in the healthy and lactacystin-lesioned brain, delayed-start valproate administration induced dose-dependent neuroprotection/restoration against lactacystin neurotoxicity, characterized by motor deficit alleviation, attenuation of morphological brain changes and restoration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Molecular analyses revealed that valproate alleviated lactacystin-induced histone hypoacetylation and induced up-regulation of brain neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors. Conclusions and Implications The histone acetylation and up-regulation of neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors associated with valproate treatment culminate in a neuroprotective and neurorestorative phenotype in this animal model of PD. As valproate induced structural re-modelling of the brain, further research is required to determine whether valproate represents a viable candidate for disease treatment; however, the results suggest that HDACIs could hold potential as disease-modifying agents in PD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylation", "Acetylcysteine", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors", "Histones", "Male", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Parkinson Disease", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Up-Regulation", "Valproic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937517004", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55382681000": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "55382681000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease Research Group, Centre for Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7006330956": {"Name": "Dexter D.", "AuthorID": "7006330956", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease Research Group, Centre for Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6701316810": {"Name": "Crum W.", "AuthorID": "6701316810", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, James Black Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "15754807300": {"Name": "Vernon A.", "AuthorID": "15754807300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, James Black Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
