LaCrO3 is an antiferromagnetic insulator, whereas SrCrO3 is a metal. Substituting Sr2+ for La3+ in LaCrO3 effectively dopes holes into the top of valence band, leading to Cr4+ (3d2) local electron configurations. Core-level and valence-band features monotonically shift to lower binding energy with increasing x, indicating downward movement of the Fermi level toward the valence band maximum. The material becomes a p-type semiconductor at lower doping levels and an insulator-to-metal transition is observed at x\u22650.65, but only when the films are deposited with in-plane compression via lattice-mismatched heteroepitaxy. Valence-band x-ray photoemission spectroscopy reveals diminution of electronic state density at the Crdt2g-derived top of the valence band, while O K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy shows the development of a new unoccupied state above the Fermi level as holes are doped into LaCrO3. The evolution of these bands with Sr concentration is accurately captured using density functional theory (DFT) with a Hubbard U correction of 3.0 eV (DFT+U). Resistivity data in the semiconducting regime (x\u22640.50) do not fit perfectly well to either a polaron hopping or band conduction model but are best interpreted in terms of a hybrid model. The activation energies extracted from these fits are well reproduced by DFT+U.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929094743", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35783755100": {"Name": "Zhang K.", "AuthorID": "35783755100", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, Fundamental and Computational Sciences Direct., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "6603675533": {"Name": "Sushko P.", "AuthorID": "6603675533", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, Fundamental and Computational Sciences Direct., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "57203175090": {"Name": "Chambers S.", "AuthorID": "57203175090", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, Fundamental and Computational Sciences Direct., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "7402894169": {"Name": "Du Y.", "AuthorID": "7402894169", "AffiliationID": "60015103, 60023471", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "7102313444": {"Name": "Bowden M.", "AuthorID": "7102313444", "AffiliationID": "60015103, 60023471", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "9739756500": {"Name": "Shutthanandan V.", "AuthorID": "9739756500", "AffiliationID": "60015103, 60023471", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "55055998800": {"Name": "Sallis S.", "AuthorID": "55055998800", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Binghamton University"}, "8861646500": {"Name": "Piper L.", "AuthorID": "8861646500", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Binghamton University"}}}
