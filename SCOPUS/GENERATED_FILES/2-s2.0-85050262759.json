Nanocrystalline eHAp has been synthesized by hydrothermal assisted precipitation method using erbium (III) ions as dopant. Physico-chemical characterization by UV/Visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), photoluminiscence spectroscopy (PL) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM) confirmed incorporation and uniform distribution of eHAp in the chitosan films. Strong antimicrobial activity was observed using eHAp incorporated chitosan films against E. coli and S. aureus by contact inhibition on agar plates. On the other hand, excellent biocompatibility was observed with human lung fibroblast cells (WI-38) which showed strong attachment and proliferation on the chitosan films with minimal cytotoxicity. Moreover, the doped films showed good biodegradation and mineralization behavior after 2 weeks in simulated body fluid. Thus the doped fluorescent chitosan films with multifunctional attributes can be a strong candidate for diverse applications like in antimicrobial treatments, wound healing, tissue scaffolds and bioimaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biocompatibility", "Chitosan", "Contact inhibition", "Cytotoxicity", "Nanocomposites"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-microbial activity", "Biomedical applications", "Field emission scanning electron microscopy", "Human lung fibroblasts", "Hydrothermal-assisted", "Physico-chemical characterization", "Precipitation methods", "Simulated body fluids", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Biocompatible Materials", "Biomedical Research", "Cell Proliferation", "Chitosan", "Durapatite", "Escherichia coli", "Fibroblasts", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Lung", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Nanocomposites", "Particle Size", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050262759", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56283617500": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "56283617500", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Jadavpur University"}, "16456874100": {"Name": "Bagchi B.", "AuthorID": "16456874100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56248104400": {"Name": "Kool A.", "AuthorID": "56248104400", "AffiliationID": "60081588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Techno India University"}, "56578161300": {"Name": "Hoque N.A.", "AuthorID": "56578161300", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Jadavpur University"}, "57194904648": {"Name": "Biswas P.", "AuthorID": "57194904648", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Jadavpur University"}, "55310802200": {"Name": "Das K.", "AuthorID": "55310802200", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Jadavpur University"}, "55605761944": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55605761944", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Jadavpur University"}, "28767475700": {"Name": "Bhandary S.", "AuthorID": "28767475700", "AffiliationID": "60007438", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute"}, "57196450212": {"Name": "Pal K.", "AuthorID": "57196450212", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Life Science &Biotechnology Department, Jadavpur University"}, "57206512545": {"Name": "Karmakar P.", "AuthorID": "57206512545", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Life Science &Biotechnology Department, Jadavpur University"}, "57219524421": {"Name": "Thakur P.", "AuthorID": "57219524421", "AffiliationID": "100350557", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Netaji Nagar College for Women"}}}
