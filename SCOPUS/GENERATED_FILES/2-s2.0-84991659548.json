This uses a mapping cone construction similar to the rigid syntomic cohomology of (Besser, Israel J Math 120(1):291\u2013334, 2000) in the good-reduction case, but with Hyodo\u2013Kato (log-crystalline) cohomology in place of rigid cohomology. In this short note, we describe a cohomology theory which is a modification of the theory of Nekov\u00e1\u0159\u2013Nizio\u0142, modified by replacing 1 - \u03c6 with other polynomials in \u03c6. This is the analogue for bad-reduction varieties of the finite-polynomial cohomology of (Besser, Invent Math 142(2):397\u2013434, 2000); and we use this cohomology theory to give formulae for p-adic regulator maps, extending the results of (Besser, Invent Math 142(2):397\u2013434, 2000; Besser, Israel J Math 120(1):335\u2013360, 2000; Besser, Israel J Math 190(1):29\u201366, 2012) to varieties over p-adic fields, without assuming any good reduction hypotheses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite-polynomial cohomology", "Regulators", "Syntomic cohomology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991659548", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"7003407048": {"Name": "Besser A.", "AuthorID": "7003407048", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "36952170600": {"Name": "Loeffler D.", "AuthorID": "36952170600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick"}, "6508170603": {"Name": "Zerbes S.", "AuthorID": "6508170603", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
