This study aimed to use two synergistic theoretical models of behaviour: the COM-B model (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour) and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify a broad spectrum of theoretically derived influences on parents' portion control behaviours including examination of affective and habitual influences often excluded from prevailing theories of behaviour change. Methods: Six focus groups exploring family weight management comprised of one with caseworkers (n = 4), four with parents of overweight children (n = 14) and one with parents of healthy weight children (n = 8). A thematic analysis was performed across the dataset where the TDF/COM-B were used as coding frameworks. Results: To achieve the target behaviour, the behavioural analysis revealed the need for eliciting change in all three COM-B domains and nine associated TDF domains. Findings suggest parents' internal processes such as their emotional responses, habits and beliefs, along with social influences from partners and grandparents, and environmental influences relating to items such as household objects, interact to influence portion size behaviours within the home environment. Conclusion: This is the first study underpinned by COM-B/TDF frameworks applied to childhood weight management and provides new targets for intervention development and the opportunity for future research to explore the mediating and moderating effects of these variables on one another.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour change", "Childhood obesity prevention", "Childhood weight management", "Health promotion", "Parental dietary behaviours", "Portion sizes", "Theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parents", "Pediatric Obesity", "Portion Size", "Psychological Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029593593", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56454906700": {"Name": "Curtis K.", "AuthorID": "56454906700", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Behaviour and Interventions Research, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University (Joint with Public Health Warwickshire)"}, "35336071500": {"Name": "Brown K.", "AuthorID": "35336071500", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Behaviour and Interventions Research, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University (Joint with Public Health Warwickshire)"}, "7005842007": {"Name": "Atkins L.", "AuthorID": "7005842007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}}}
