Recent findings Recent level 1 evidence shows that multiparametric MRI has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-na\u00efve men. Concurrent developments include important work in the standardization of MRI reporting. The low specificity and positive predictive value of MRI means that biopsy is still necessary following MRI. MRI-targeted prostate biopsy has emerged as an alternative diagnostic test to transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy, though its exact role in biopsy-na\u00efve men and the optimal technique remain to be defined. Summary There is the potential for MRI to be used as a triage test to allow a proportion of men to avoid biopsy and remain on prostate-specific antigen surveillance. MRI-suspicious areas can be sampled more intensively using MRI-targeted biopsy that can be carried out in a variety of ways. Future work should focus on the cost-effectiveness of introducing a prebiopsy MRI pathway in biopsy-na\u00efve men and addressing the training needs for such a change.
