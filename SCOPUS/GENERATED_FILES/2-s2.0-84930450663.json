Demographic aging is a reality in Portugal, being expectable that the number of dementia cases also increases. Even so, dementia-epidemiological data in Portugal is scarce and cost-of-illness studies are almost inexistent. Our aims were to obtain up-to-date information about the prevalence of dementia/ Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Portugal, to estimate the number of cases effectively diagnosed as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and to determine illness-costs with specific dementia treatment. Material and Methods: The numbers of age-adjusted prevalence of dementia obtained for Occidental Europe (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International study), where applied to the resident population in Portugal (2013). Estimations related to diagnosis and treatment-costs were based in data provided by the Intercontinental Marketing Services Health (IMSH) \u2013 2013. Results: The estimated number of Portuguese people with dementia among those aged \u2265 60 years, is 160287, representing 5.91% of this population-stratum. Knowing Alzheimer\u2019s disease is responsible for 50-70% of all cases, we might conclude there are between 80144 and 112201 patients. According to IMSH-data, 76250 receive anti-dementia drugs and the costs of this kind of medication is 37 M\u20ac/year. Conclusions: As a consequence of the demographic aging, also the number of dementia cases increases. Aparentely, not all Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients receive the recommended medication, suggesting this condition is still under-diagnosed. However, figures indicate a positive progression with an increment of treated cases and a reduction of medication-costs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Cost of illness", "Dementia", "Portugal", "Prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia", "Health Care Costs", "Humans", "Incidence", "Middle Aged", "Portugal", "Prevalence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930450663", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603922366": {"Name": "Santana I.", "AuthorID": "6603922366", "AffiliationID": "60019112", "AffiliationName": "Consulta de Dem\u00eancia, Servi\u00e7o de Neurologia, Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra"}, "54787494500": {"Name": "Freitas S.", "AuthorID": "54787494500", "AffiliationID": "60106437, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, N\u00facleo de Estudos e Interven\u00e7\u00e3o Cognitivo Comportamental (CINEICC), Universidade de Coimbra"}, "56669650600": {"Name": "Farinha F.", "AuthorID": "56669650600", "AffiliationID": "113320781", "AffiliationName": "Servi\u00e7o de Reumatologia, Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga"}, "7101600456": {"Name": "Rodrigues V.", "AuthorID": "7101600456", "AffiliationID": "60020985", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Epidemiologia e Medicina Preventiva, Universidade de Coimbra"}, "7201882568": {"Name": "Carvalho \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "7201882568", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
