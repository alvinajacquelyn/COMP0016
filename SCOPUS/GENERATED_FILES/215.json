[19,20]) vanishes. We obtain thereby a purely algebraic proof of Petrie's Theorem ([14]) that G(p,q) has free period 2q.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagonal resolution", "Metacyclic group"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003876223", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"]], "AuthorData": {"7401522198": {"Name": "Johnson F.", "AuthorID": "7401522198", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57192315308": {"Name": "Remez J.", "AuthorID": "57192315308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
