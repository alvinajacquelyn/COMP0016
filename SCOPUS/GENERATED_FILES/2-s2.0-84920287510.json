Allowing for key background characteristics, social fragmentation generally added little to explain child outcomes, but there were fewer conduct problems among children in poor neighbourhoods with less fragmentation. Surprisingly, in less fragmented neighbourhoods poor families tended to feel less safe and more distressed, which was associated with children[U+05F3]s conduct problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child behavior", "Family poverty", "MCS", "Neighborhood poverty", "Neighborhood social fragmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Poverty", "Residence Characteristics", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920287510", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"7003573629": {"Name": "Flouri E.", "AuthorID": "7003573629", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55596489700": {"Name": "Midouhas E.", "AuthorID": "55596489700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56839879200": {"Name": "Joshi H.", "AuthorID": "56839879200", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56467722000": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "56467722000", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
