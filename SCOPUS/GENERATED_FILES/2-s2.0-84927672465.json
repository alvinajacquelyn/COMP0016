We investigated its incidence, clinical characteristics and relationship with other factors in patients receiving tPA at a UK centre. Methods 530 consecutive patients (median age 70 years) receiving tPA treatment for confirmed ischaemic stroke were included. Cases were defined as those developing angio-oedema within 24 h of initiation of tPA. Angio-oedema was retrospectively classified as mild, moderate or severe using predefined criteria. The primary analysis was the association between prior ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) treatment and angio-oedema. Results Orolingual angio-oedema was observed in 42 patients (7.9%; 95% CI 5.5% to 10.6%), ranging from 5 to 189 min after initiation of tPA (median 65 min). 12% of the angio-oedema cases were severe (1% of all patients treated with tPA), requiring urgent advanced airway management. 172 patients (33%) were taking ACE-I. In multifactorial analyses, only prior ACE-I treatment remained a significant independent predictor of angio-oedema (odds ratio (OR) 2.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.7). Conclusions Angio-oedema occurs more frequently than previously reported and is associated with preceding ACE-I treatment. Angio-oedema may be delayed and progress to life-threatening airway compromise, which has implications for the assessment and delivery of thrombolysis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Angioedema", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "England", "Female", "Fibrinolytic Agents", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Mouth", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Thrombolytic Therapy", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator", "Tongue"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927672465", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55325554000": {"Name": "Hurford R.", "AuthorID": "55325554000", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Centre, Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201654970": {"Name": "Rezvani S.", "AuthorID": "57201654970", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Stroke and Vascular Research Centre, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "56262316000": {"Name": "Kreimei M.", "AuthorID": "56262316000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Stroke and Vascular Research Centre, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7003808968": {"Name": "Vail A.", "AuthorID": "7003808968", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Health Sciences Research Group, University of Manchester"}, "23989586200": {"Name": "Parry-Jones A.R.", "AuthorID": "23989586200", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Centre, Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005446590": {"Name": "Tyrrell P.J.", "AuthorID": "7005446590", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Centre, Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7501653486": {"Name": "Smith C.J.", "AuthorID": "7501653486", "AffiliationID": "60008873, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences Building, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35363866800": {"Name": "Douglass C.", "AuthorID": "35363866800", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Centre, Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005145101": {"Name": "Molloy J.", "AuthorID": "7005145101", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Centre, Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54781429100": {"Name": "Herbert A.", "AuthorID": "54781429100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Paediatric Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "14057528800": {"Name": "Alachkar H.", "AuthorID": "14057528800", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
