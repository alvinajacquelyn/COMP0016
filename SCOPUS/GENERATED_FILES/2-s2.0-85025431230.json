All rights reserved.The 1920s saw the birth of Soviet cinema and the first films of the masters Lev Kuleshov, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Dziga Vertov, and Aleksandr Dovzhenko. Boris Barnet himself told the French film historian Georges Sadoul, perhaps fancifully, that his great-grandfather was an English soldier who set up in Russia during the Napoleonic wars. He spent two years as a professional boxer and took part in bouts of \"French\" wrestling, in which he was presented as the champion of Denmark or Iceland. The film both celebrates and pastiches the American action cinema, which, as Kuleshov (1922) had established, was enormously popular among early Soviet audiences. Barnet's first planned film after the war was an adaptation of Aleksandr Ostrovskii's 1875 play Wolves and Sheep with the veteran director Iakov Protazanov, but the project was aborted on Protazanov's sudden death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aleksandr Dovzhenko", "Boris Barnet", "Dziga Vertov", "French film", "Lev Kuleshov", "Sergei Eisenstein", "Soviet cinema", "Vsevolod Pudovkin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025431230", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"35573384400": {"Name": "Graffy J.", "AuthorID": "35573384400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
