Slingshot NSDI is a general mechanism present for a wide range of low intensities and pulse durations. Anticorrelated two-electron escape is its striking hallmark. This mechanism offers an alternative explanation of anticorrelated two-electron escape obtained in previous studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron escape", "Low-intensity", "Nonsequential double ionizations", "Pulse durations", "Recollision", "Recollision thresholds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059233687", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57205241380": {"Name": "Katsoulis G.", "AuthorID": "57205241380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57205235713": {"Name": "Hadjipittas A.", "AuthorID": "57205235713", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "11141276900": {"Name": "Bergues B.", "AuthorID": "11141276900", "AffiliationID": "60029010", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics"}, "8943606600": {"Name": "Kling M.", "AuthorID": "8943606600", "AffiliationID": "60029010", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics"}}}
