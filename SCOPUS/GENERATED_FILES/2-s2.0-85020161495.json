Caschili and Medda (2015) define port attractiveness as the combination of the productive capacity of a port and its level of international competitiveness which together provide direct and indirect economic benefits. A port generates freight traffic through its connections with inland trade routes and with other regional and international ports. Thus, in order to be attractive and competitive, ports often need to be integrated vertically, i.e. have secure maritime routes and landside operations, and integrated horizontally, i.e. be highly specialised with a wide geographical market share. The implication here is that a port must be equipped with effective facilities, it must provide reliable services at the lowest price, and it needs to have an efficient productivity level. These characteristics combined comprise the reputation of a port as an intricate network of operators, investors and maritime brokers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020161495", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6603380130": {"Name": "Medda F.", "AuthorID": "6603380130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "36157854300": {"Name": "Caravelli F.", "AuthorID": "36157854300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "36462364400": {"Name": "Caschili S.", "AuthorID": "36462364400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "7404870460": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "7404870460", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
