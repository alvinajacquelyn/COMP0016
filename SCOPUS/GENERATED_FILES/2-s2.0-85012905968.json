Cancer stemlike cells (CSCs) are a distinct subpopulation of cells implicated in the resistance of tumors to anti-cancer therapy. However, their role in the resistance of EAC to CRT is largely unknown. In this study, using a novel in vitro isogenic model of radioresistant EAC, we demonstrate that radioresistant EAC cells have enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo, increased expression of CSC-associated markers and enhanced holoclone forming ability. Further investigation identified a subpopulation of cells that are characterised by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, enhanced radioresistance and decreased expression of miR-17-5p. In vitro, miR-17-5p was demonstrated to significantly sensitise radioresistant cells to X-ray radiation and promoted the repression of genes with miR-17-5p binding sites, such as C6orf120. In vivo, miR-17-5p was significantly decreased, whilst C6orf120 was significantly increased, in pre-treatment EAC tumour samples from patients who demonstrated a poor response to neoadjuvant CRT. This study sheds novel insights into the role of CSCs in the resistance of EAC to CRT and highlights miR-17-5p as a potential biomarker of CRT sensitivity and novel therapeutic target in treatment resistant EAC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer stem-like cells", "Esophageal adenocarcinoma", "MicroRNA", "Predictive biomarker", "Radioresistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Separation", "Down-Regulation", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "MicroRNAs", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Radiation Tolerance", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012905968", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"26023472000": {"Name": "Lynam-Lennon N.", "AuthorID": "26023472000", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Department of Surgery, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital"}, "55856382500": {"Name": "Heavey S.", "AuthorID": "55856382500", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Department of Surgery, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital"}, "57188973519": {"Name": "Sommerville G.", "AuthorID": "57188973519", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Department of Surgery, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital"}, "57193319571": {"Name": "Quinn J.", "AuthorID": "57193319571", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Department of Surgery, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital"}, "7403603500": {"Name": "Reynolds J.V.", "AuthorID": "7403603500", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Department of Surgery, Trinity College Dublin, St James's Hospital"}, "24477842200": {"Name": "Maher S.G.", "AuthorID": "24477842200", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Biology and Therapeutics Lab, School of Life Sciences, University of Hull"}, "56573772800": {"Name": "Bibby B.A.S.", "AuthorID": "56573772800", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Biology and Therapeutics Lab, School of Life Sciences, University of Hull"}, "53163383200": {"Name": "Ffrench B.", "AuthorID": "53163383200", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Coombe Women and Infant's University Hospital"}, "56613197700": {"Name": "Gasch C.", "AuthorID": "56613197700", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Coombe Women and Infant's University Hospital"}, "7202225810": {"Name": "O'Leary J.J.", "AuthorID": "7202225810", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Coombe Women and Infant's University Hospital"}, "16318418200": {"Name": "Gallagher M.F.", "AuthorID": "16318418200", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Coombe Women and Infant's University Hospital"}}}
