Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of 1500 consecutive cases discussed from 2 September 2015 onwards. Performance was assessed as the number of cases where a clinical recommendation was made. The cost per meeting, discussion and patient were calculated using the mid-point of pay band attributable to the attendees (National Health Service pay scales 2015). Results: Over 34 meetings, 1500 discussions occurred (933 patients: 61.7% male; mean age 63.8). Above a one-quarter of discussions (n = 399, 26.6%) were new referrals. Each patient\u2019s case was discussed a mean of 1.6 times, the majority being discussed once (n = 563, 60.3%). In 93.3% of discussions, a clinical recommendation was made. Only 100 discussions (6.7%) were deferred due to incomplete clinical information. A total of 11.1% (n = 166) cases were discharged. The average costs were: \u00a3141,901 per year, \u00a32729 per meeting, \u00a362 per case discussed and \u00a399 per patient. Conclusion: One discussion was usually sufficient to decide management; deferral was uncommon; and, given the low discharge rate, referrals seemed appropriate. The cost per patient was modest, and represented good value in providing a focused and shared clinical decision-making pathway for renal cancer patients.
