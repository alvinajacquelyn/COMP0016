Slow sand filtration has been found to be capable of removing anti-inflammatory compounds, and its low maintenance costs and easy operation make it an attractive technology for treating drinking water in many parts of the world. In addition, slow sand filters can be used at both large and household scales. The biofilm (i.e. schmutzdecke) developed on the top of the sand and within the upper layers of the sand is acknowledged to be responsible for the water purification. However, it is possible that the PPCPs may affect the schmutzdecke development and microbial community within the filters, and consequently the performance of the filter. This study investigated two household slow sand filters (for water purification) operated intermittently with and without contamination by six PPCPs. Eleven parameters were monitored in the affluent and effluent water, including bacterial species present and schmutzdecke biomass development. Results demonstrated that the household slow sand filter performance was not affected by the 2 \u03bcg L\u2212 1 of PPCPs in the water. There was no significant difference between filters for total coliforms and E. coli removal, but there was considerable difference between sampling times. Biomass considerably increased with the number of filtrations in both filters and there was no significant difference between filter biomass. However, it was found that more bacterial species were present in the period with no contamination than during the contamination period. Bacillus anthracis and Exiguobacterium sp. showed to be resistant to the effects of the PPCPs. These suggest there are effects of PPCPs on bacterial species within the filter. However, the effect of the PPCPs on biomass was not conclusive in this study and needs to be further investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteria sequencing", "Biofilm", "Biomass", "Pharmaceuticals and personal care compounds", "Slow sand filters"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-inflammatories", "Exiguobacterium sp", "Low income countries", "Microbial communities", "Personal care compounds", "Pharmaceuticals and personal care products", "Slow sand filters", "Slow sand filtration", "Bacteria", "Biofilms", "Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals", "Cosmetics", "Escherichia coli", "Filtration", "Silicon Dioxide", "Water Purification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009453048", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57192956233": {"Name": "Pompei C.", "AuthorID": "57192956233", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Water Resources and Applied Ecology Center, S\u00e3o Carlos School of Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "18435943500": {"Name": "Ciric L.", "AuthorID": "18435943500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "56573682000": {"Name": "Canales M.", "AuthorID": "56573682000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "36947932100": {"Name": "Karu K.", "AuthorID": "36947932100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL)"}, "7102986924": {"Name": "Vieira E.", "AuthorID": "7102986924", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Physics, S\u00e3o Carlos Institute of Chemistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
