We reconsider the underlying mechanism of tuberculosis pathology and demonstrate that collagen destruction may be a critical initial event, causing caseous necrosis as opposed to resulting from it. In human tuberculosis granulomas, regions of extracellular matrix destruction map to areas of caseous necrosis. In mice, transgenic expression of human matrix metalloproteinase 1 causes caseous necrosis, the pathological hallmark of human tuberculosis. Collagen destruction is the principal pathological difference between humanised mice and wild-type mice with tuberculosis, whereas the release of proinflammatory cytokines does not differ, demonstrating that collagen breakdown may lead to cell death and caseation. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a 3-dimensional cell culture model of tuberculosis granuloma formation, using bioelectrospray technology. Collagen improved survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cells analyzed on the basis of a lactate dehydrogenase release assay, propidium iodide staining, and measurement of the total number of viable cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that collagen destruction is an initial event in tuberculosis immunopathology, leading to caseous necrosis and compromising the immune response, revealing a previously unappreciated role for the extracellular matrix in regulating the host-pathogen interaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["extracellular matrix", "immunopathology", "matrix metalloprotease", "tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Collagen", "Extracellular Matrix", "Granuloma", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Neoplasms", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 1", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Biological", "Necrosis", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930317830", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56786146800": {"Name": "Al Shammari B.", "AuthorID": "56786146800", "AffiliationID": "115581793", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity Section, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "56502214500": {"Name": "Sathyamoorthy T.", "AuthorID": "56502214500", "AffiliationID": "115581793", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity Section, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "7102333663": {"Name": "Friedland J.S.", "AuthorID": "7102333663", "AffiliationID": "115581793", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity Section, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "57194531731": {"Name": "Elkington P.T.", "AuthorID": "57194531731", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "19736453100": {"Name": "Mauri F.", "AuthorID": "19736453100", "AffiliationID": "115581498", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Centre for Pathology, Division of Experimental Medicine"}, "7201834614": {"Name": "Robertson B.D.", "AuthorID": "7201834614", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "16314546000": {"Name": "Workman V.", "AuthorID": "16314546000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "7005843306": {"Name": "Jayasinghe S.N.", "AuthorID": "7005843306", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "37028972600": {"Name": "Tezera L.", "AuthorID": "37028972600", "AffiliationID": "114090719", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine"}, "35558142200": {"Name": "Bielecka M.K.", "AuthorID": "35558142200", "AffiliationID": "114090719", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine"}, "7101608985": {"Name": "Shiomi T.", "AuthorID": "7101608985", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University"}, "6603669343": {"Name": "D'Armiento J.", "AuthorID": "6603669343", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University"}}}
