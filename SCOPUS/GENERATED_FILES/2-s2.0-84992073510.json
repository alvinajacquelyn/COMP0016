All rights reserved.The Multiple Airports System (MAS) has been the topic of an increasing number of studies over recent years in the spatial and network analysis. However, there is relatively limited literature on the MAS in the perspective of logistics. This paper proposes the concept of the Multi-Airport Logistics System (MLS) by reviewing the related literature on MAS and comparing the performance of cargo and passengers transport in the U.S. MASs. Under the concept of the MLS, the boundary and the populations of the MLS are discussed by utilizing case studies on the MLS in the U.S., especially the Northeast MLS. Compared with existing studies, the concept of the MLS focus on the coordination of cargo development among airports and provide a framework for airports' cargo development within the same region. By using Multiple Cases Study, we found that the agents gain experiences from the interaction with other agents and the environment, i.e. self-education of Agents by building blocks in the system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["air cargo supply chain", "airport logistics", "Multi-Airport Logistics System", "self-education of agents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air cargo", "Airport logistics", "Building blockes", "Case-studies", "Self-education"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992073510", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"35749143700": {"Name": "Shen D.", "AuthorID": "35749143700", "AffiliationID": "60028512", "AffiliationName": "School of Economy and Management, Civil Aviation University of China"}, "7101650594": {"Name": "Le M.", "AuthorID": "7101650594", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Aviation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}, "37079435300": {"Name": "Rankin W.", "AuthorID": "37079435300", "AffiliationID": "60010339", "AffiliationName": "College of Aeronautics, Florida Institute of Technology"}}}
