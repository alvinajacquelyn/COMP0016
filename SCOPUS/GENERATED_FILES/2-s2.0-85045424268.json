Yet remarkably little research has examined the types of support that these families perceive to be beneficial to their lives. This study, co-produced by researchers and school-based professionals, sought to establish these families\u2019 support needs from their own perspectives. In total, 139 parents of autistic children with additional intellectual disabilities and limited spoken communication, all attending an inner-city London school, participated in an initial survey examining parental wellbeing, self-efficacy and the extent to which they felt supported. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subgroup of parents (n = 17), some of whom reported in the survey that they felt unsupported, in order to gain their in-depth perspectives. The results from both the survey and the interviews suggested that existing support (particularly from formal support services) was not meeting parents\u2019 needs, which ultimately made them feel isolated and alienated. Parents who were interviewed called for service provision that adopted a relational, family-centred approach \u2013 one that understands the specific needs of the whole family, builds a close working relationship with them and ensures that they are supported at times when the parents and families feel they need it most.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autism", "education", "parents", "participatory research", "self-efficacy", "services", "support", "wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Communication Disorders", "Family", "Female", "Health Services", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "London", "Male", "Parents", "Self Efficacy", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045424268", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57202943668": {"Name": "Galpin J.", "AuthorID": "57202943668", "AffiliationID": "114541420", "AffiliationName": "The Bridge School"}, "57202949521": {"Name": "Barratt P.", "AuthorID": "57202949521", "AffiliationID": "114541420", "AffiliationName": "The Bridge School"}, "57202942215": {"Name": "Ashcroft E.", "AuthorID": "57202942215", "AffiliationID": "114541420", "AffiliationName": "The Bridge School"}, "57191189643": {"Name": "Greathead S.", "AuthorID": "57191189643", "AffiliationID": "114541420", "AffiliationName": "The Bridge School"}, "57189064715": {"Name": "Kenny L.", "AuthorID": "57189064715", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6507658484": {"Name": "Pellicano E.", "AuthorID": "6507658484", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}}}
