XANES provides the information on the oxidation state of the titanium species as well as their change in coordination geometry during de- and re-hydration. Results from in situ XANES studies shows that TS-1 is much more hydrophobic than TiAl or TiFe systems. Pre-edge features of Ti K-edge XANES spectra of these materials also suggested that TiIV is the dominant Ti coordination in dehydrated system whilst TiVI is the dominant in the re-hydrated one.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nanoporous frameworks", "Titanium sites", "Titanosilicate", "XANES"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coordination geometry", "In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy", "Local structure", "Nano-porous", "Oxidation state", "Pre-edge features", "Titanosilicates", "XANES"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986275088", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"54413012200": {"Name": "Nguyen H.K.D.", "AuthorID": "54413012200", "AffiliationID": "60071354", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, C4-306, Hanoi University of Science and Technology"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}}}
