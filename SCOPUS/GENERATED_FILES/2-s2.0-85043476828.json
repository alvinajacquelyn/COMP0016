For instance, this approach allowed for the first time to study in the intact brain the dynamics of individual amyloid plaques, and the effects of anti-amyloid therapies on plaque formation and growth. Moreover, by combining two-photon microscopy with fluorescent calcium indicators, an amyloid-dependent abnormal hyperactivity of cortical and hippocampal neurons was revealed as a primary neuronal impairment, which was not predicted from previous in vitro analyses. Here, a method for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with single-cell and single-action potential accuracy in the hippocampus of Alzheimer mouse models is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Calcium imaging", "Hippocampus", "In vivo imaging", "Mouse models", "Neuronal hyperactivity", "Two-photon microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Calcium", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hippocampus", "Mice", "Neurons", "Optical Imaging", "Photons"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043476828", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"23134362400": {"Name": "Busche M.", "AuthorID": "23134362400", "AffiliationID": "114439723", "AffiliationName": "Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology"}}}
