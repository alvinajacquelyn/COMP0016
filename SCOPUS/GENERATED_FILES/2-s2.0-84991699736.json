We compute the kinetic energy release of the nuclei and find a good agreement between experiment and our model. We explore the two pathways of FDI and show that, with increasing field strength, over-the-barrier ionization overtakes tunnel ionization as the underlying mechanism of FDI. Moreover, we compute the angular distribution of the ion fragments for FDI and identify a feature that can potentially be observed experimentally and is a signature of only one of the two pathways of FDI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Double ionization", "Field strengths", "Kinetic energy release", "Linearly polarized", "Near Infrared", "Semiclassical model", "Triatomic molecules", "Tunnel ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991699736", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56816105400": {"Name": "Chen A.", "AuthorID": "56816105400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57194688243": {"Name": "Price H.", "AuthorID": "57194688243", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603180970": {"Name": "Staudte A.", "AuthorID": "6603180970", "AffiliationID": "60028897, 60193395, 60009839", "AffiliationName": "Joint Laboratory for Attosecond Science, University of Ottawa, National Research Council"}}}
