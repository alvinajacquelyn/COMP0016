More and more frequently, users are called to make decisions concerning the disclosure of their personal information. In this study, we investigate the factors affecting users' choices toward the disclosure of their personal data, including not only their demographic and self-reported individual characteristics, but also their social interactions and their mobility patterns inferred frommonths of mobile phone data activity. We report the findings of a field study conducted with a community of 63 subjects provided with (i) a smart-phone and (ii) a Personal Data Store (PDS) enabling them to control the disclosure of their data. We monitor the sharing behavior of our participants through the PDS and evaluate the contribution of different factors affecting their disclosing choices of location and social interaction data. Our analysis shows that social interaction inferred by mobile phones is an important factor revealing willingness to share, regardless of the data type. In addition, we provide further insights on the individual traits relevant to the prediction of sharing behavior", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human factors", "Living labs", "Mobile sensing", "Personal mobile data", "Privacy", "Social computing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Individual characteristics", "Living lab", "Mobile data", "Mobile sensing", "Personal information", "Social computing", "Social media platforms", "Willingness to share"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016463166", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56354787700": {"Name": "Perentis C.", "AuthorID": "56354787700", "AffiliationID": "60023916, 60083112", "AffiliationName": "Telecom Italia - Semantics and Knowledge Innovation Lab (SKIL), Fondazione Bruno Kessler"}, "55860084500": {"Name": "Vescovi M.", "AuthorID": "55860084500", "AffiliationID": "60023916", "AffiliationName": "Telecom Italia - SKIL"}, "6701805460": {"Name": "Moiso C.", "AuthorID": "6701805460", "AffiliationID": "60023916", "AffiliationName": "Telecom Italia - Future Center"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60111768, 60100056", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute, British Library"}, "23482228900": {"Name": "Leonardi C.", "AuthorID": "23482228900", "AffiliationID": "60083112", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler"}, "12241486300": {"Name": "Pianesi F.", "AuthorID": "12241486300", "AffiliationID": "60083112", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler"}, "14008023300": {"Name": "Lepri B.", "AuthorID": "14008023300", "AffiliationID": "60083112", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler"}}}
