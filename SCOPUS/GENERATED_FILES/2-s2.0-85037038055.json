All rights reserved.The atolls and coral banks of the Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory) in the central Indian Ocean were severely affected by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) thermal event that started in 2015 and which lasted for nearly two years. On these reefs, coral mortality reduced scleractinian coral cover from 40%\u201350% to <10% and commonly to only about 5% in water less than 15 m depth. The three-dimensional structure of the reefs was significantly reduced as a result, and the prolonged warming almost eliminated soft corals. Most atolls of the archipelago are uninhabited, so any changes are driven by broad environmental changes rather than by direct, local anthropogenic effects. Coral cover was first measured in 1978, temperature loggers have recorded water temperature at various depths for the last 11 years, and the results of the recent warming event are placed in this context. Over this time, cover has declined severely along with a general rise in water temperature of one-third of a degree Celsius on ocean reefs and by more than one-half of a degree Celsius in lagoons. Major fluctuations of coral cover caused by warm episodes have sometimes, but not always, coincided with ENSO events and have occurred on top of the increasing trend in background temperatures. Juvenile coral populations have also recently severely declined following the mortality of the adults. Estimates of calcification suggest a marked reduction, from a state of vigorous reef growth that had not long recovered from the earlier severe warming event of 1998, to a state of net erosion. Predictions suggest that recurrences of mass mortalities will take place too frequently for any significant recovery of reef health in these atolls by the late 2020s.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atolls", "Chagos Archipelago", "Coral bleaching", "Coral reefs", "Ocean warming", "Sea temperature"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037038055", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"]], "AuthorData": {"55660987600": {"Name": "Sheppard C.", "AuthorID": "55660987600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick"}, "7006214344": {"Name": "Sheppard A.", "AuthorID": "7006214344", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick"}, "54952136700": {"Name": "Mogg A.", "AuthorID": "54952136700", "AffiliationID": "60026195, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "Natural Environment Research Council National Facility for Scientific Diving, Scottish Association for Marine Sciences, Scottish Marine Institute"}, "57198768914": {"Name": "Bayley D.", "AuthorID": "57198768914", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "56076337500": {"Name": "Dempsey A.C.", "AuthorID": "56076337500", "AffiliationID": "60159434", "AffiliationName": "Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation"}, "16242437400": {"Name": "Roche R.", "AuthorID": "16242437400", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Ocean Sciences, Bangor University"}, "57212569984": {"Name": "Turner J.", "AuthorID": "57212569984", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Ocean Sciences, Bangor University"}, "6507258668": {"Name": "Purkis S.", "AuthorID": "6507258668", "AffiliationID": "60011484, 60029251", "AffiliationName": "Center for Carbonate Research, Dept. of Marine Geosciences, RSMAS, University of Miami"}}}
