A distinctive feature of the proposed method is that the frequencies are directly adapted, thus not requiring further steps of eigenvalue extraction or polynomial root-finding to retrieve the frequencies from the characteristic polynomial, as typically done in the literature. The frequency estimation problem is approached by formulating a new state-space realization of the signal generator (oscillatory internal model) which is characterized by a minimal parameterization in the sense that only n parameters are used to assign the spectrum of the generator, i.e., the n frequencies of the components. In contrast with other existing adaptive observer-based methods that provide direct estimates of the frequencies, the proposed technique does not require state augmentation, making the overall dynamic order (internal model's state+parameters) equal to 3n.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive observer", "Characteristic polynomials", "Multi-sinusoidal signals", "Multiple frequency", "Polynomial root findings", "Sinusoidal components", "State augmentation", "State space realization"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962023203", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"23991087000": {"Name": "Pin G.", "AuthorID": "23991087000", "AffiliationID": "60019612", "AffiliationName": "Electrolux Professional S.p.A."}, "57188647069": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57188647069", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "56021899900": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56021899900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "University of Trieste"}}}
