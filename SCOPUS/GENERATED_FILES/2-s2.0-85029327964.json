The detailed modelling uses the future energy scenario assessment (FESA) tool, which uses real weather data and real electricity demand data from year 2001 to model future supply and demand profiles, suitably adjusted to reflect technology uptakes. The paper describes the linking of the DECC 2050 Calculator with FESA and many of the detailed considerations within the modelling. The calculation of net demand (total demand less intermittent renewables and inflexible portions of other electricity generation) reveals the magnitude and duration of peaks and troughs throughout the year and this allows quantification of required peaking plant, energy storage, demand response or a combination of these. The results indicate that the grid balancing challenge is much greater than is apparent from the DECC 2050 Calculator, with significant excess power from renewables and less flexible generators needing to be exported or curtailed, and, at other times of the year, a significant amount of additional conventional generation being required. FESA also indicates significantly lower capacity factors for despatchable generators than indicated in the DECC 2050 Calculator. The results underline the value of energy storage and flexible demand, particularly in the high-renewables pathways, but also that much of that storage and flexibility needs to be available for days or even weeks rather than hours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demand side management", "energy security", "energy storage", "grid balancing", "Low-carbon transition pathways", "model integration", "renewable energy", "scenarios", "time step modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Grid balancing", "Low-carbon transitions", "Model integration", "Renewable energies", "scenarios", "Time step"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029327964", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"8840858700": {"Name": "Barton J.", "AuthorID": "8840858700", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology, Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "54410898000": {"Name": "McKenna E.", "AuthorID": "54410898000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "36609429000": {"Name": "Thomson M.", "AuthorID": "36609429000", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology, Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}}}
