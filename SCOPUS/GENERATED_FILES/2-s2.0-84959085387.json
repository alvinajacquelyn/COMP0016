All rights reserved.Objectives: To use electronic health records (EHR) to predict lifetime costs and health outcomes of patients with stable coronary artery disease (stable-CAD) stratified by their risk of future cardiovascular events, and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatments targeted at these populations. Methods: The analysis was based on 94 966 patients with stable-CAD in England between 2001 and 2010, identified in four prospectively collected, linked EHR sources. Markov modelling was used to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) stratified by baseline cardiovascular risk. Results: For the lowest risk tenth of patients with stable-CAD, predicted discounted remaining lifetime healthcare costs and QALYs were \u00a362 210 (95% CI \u00a333 724 to \u00a390 043) and 12.0 (95% CI 11.5 to 12.5) years, respectively. For the highest risk tenth of the population, the equivalent costs and QALYs were \u00a335 549 (95% CI \u00a331 679 to \u00a339 615) and 2.9 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.1) years, respectively. A new treatment with a hazard reduction of 20% for myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular disease death and no side-effects would be cost-effective if priced below \u00a372 per year for the lowest risk patients and \u00a3646 per year for the highest risk patients. Conclusions: Existing EHRs may be used to estimate lifetime healthcare costs and outcomes of patients with stable-CAD. The stable-CAD model developed in this study lends itself to informing decisions about commissioning, pricing and reimbursement. At current prices, to be cost-effective some established as well as future stable-CAD treatments may require stratification by patient risk.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Data Mining", "Databases, Factual", "Decision Support Techniques", "Disease Progression", "Electronic Health Records", "England", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "Humans", "Male", "Markov Chains", "Middle Aged", "Models, Economic", "Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959085387", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55931970200": {"Name": "Asaria M.", "AuthorID": "55931970200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "56427413300": {"Name": "Walker S.", "AuthorID": "56427413300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "8072192800": {"Name": "Palmer S.", "AuthorID": "8072192800", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "7006261947": {"Name": "Manca A.", "AuthorID": "7006261947", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "7006749329": {"Name": "Sculpher M.", "AuthorID": "7006749329", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "35837808000": {"Name": "Gale C.P.", "AuthorID": "35837808000", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health, Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds"}, "36669369400": {"Name": "Shah A.D.", "AuthorID": "36669369400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College"}, "35453440300": {"Name": "Abrams K.R.", "AuthorID": "35453440300", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "55058953200": {"Name": "Crowther M.", "AuthorID": "55058953200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit, Barts and the London NHS Trust"}}}
