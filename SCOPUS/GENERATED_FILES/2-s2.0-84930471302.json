Evidence from past studies that lighting enhances reassurance is supported by the findings of an unfocussed approach that aimed deliberately to avoid focus on lighting or fear, thus to counter the unintended potential for focussed, quantitative methods to lead towards such a finding. Review of the characteristics of lighting suggests an optimum illuminance of 10 lux, of high S/P ratio, and aimed toward the pedestrian and natural elements of the environment, will enhance reassurance. Further research is needed to validate the optimum illuminance, the appropriate metric for characterising lamp spectral power distribution, and the most desirable aims of spatial distribution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Natural elements", "Quantitative method", "Road lighting", "Spectral power distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930471302", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6602873224": {"Name": "Fotios S.", "AuthorID": "6602873224", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "56669547300": {"Name": "Unwin J.", "AuthorID": "56669547300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "6701830859": {"Name": "Farrall S.", "AuthorID": "6701830859", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Law, University of Sheffield"}}}
