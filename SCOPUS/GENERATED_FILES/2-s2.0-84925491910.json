Subjects with N/V post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery had significantly elevated fasting GLP-1 levels compared to that with post-operative asymptomatic subjects and to morbidly obese, obese and lean subjects not undergoing surgery. Weight loss, glycaemia, insulin and post-prandial GLP-1 levels were similar in all post-operative subjects. Despite comparable BMI, leptin was significantly lower in symptomatic subjects. Furthermore, leptin secretion from subcutaneous adipose tissue was inhibited by GLP-1 (0.1\u20131.0 nM; n = 6). Persistent N/V following RYGB surgery is associated with elevated fasting GLP-1, but lower leptin levels. The latter may be a consequence of the direct GLP-1 inhibition of leptin secretion from adipose tissue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipokines", "GLP-1", "Nausea"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipokines", "Adult", "Blood Glucose", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Gastric Bypass", "Glucagon-Like Peptide 1", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Leptin", "Middle Aged", "Nausea", "Obesity, Morbid", "Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting", "Postprandial Period", "Vomiting", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925491910", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56433503400": {"Name": "Al-Rasheid N.", "AuthorID": "56433503400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Adipokines & Metabolism Research Group, Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56433620700": {"Name": "Marina-Gonzalez N.", "AuthorID": "56433620700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Adipokines & Metabolism Research Group, Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7003593141": {"Name": "Mohamed-Ali V.", "AuthorID": "7003593141", "AffiliationID": "60116711", "AffiliationName": "Life Science Research Division, Anti Doping Laboratory Qatar (ADLQ)"}, "7403689625": {"Name": "Gray R.", "AuthorID": "7403689625", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "North London Obesity Surgery Service, Whittington Hospital"}, "6508264160": {"Name": "Sufi P.", "AuthorID": "6508264160", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "North London Obesity Surgery Service, Whittington Hospital"}, "56432832400": {"Name": "Atherton E.", "AuthorID": "56432832400", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "North London Obesity Surgery Service, Whittington Hospital"}, "6504325449": {"Name": "Al-Sayrafi M.", "AuthorID": "6504325449", "AffiliationID": "60116711", "AffiliationName": "Life Science Research Division, Anti Doping Laboratory Qatar (ADLQ)"}}}
