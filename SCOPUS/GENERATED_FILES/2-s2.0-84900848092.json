In this study we tested for association between telomere length and methylated cytosine levels. Measurements of mean telomere length and DNA methylation at >450,000 CpG sites were obtained for both blood (N = 24) and EBV-transformed cell-line (N = 36) DNA samples from men aged 44-45 years. We identified 65 gene promoters enriched for CpG sites at which methylation levels are associated with leukocyte telomere length, and 36 gene promoters enriched for CpG sites at which methylation levels are associated with telomere length in DNA from EBV-transformed cell-lines. We observed significant enrichment of positively associated methylated CpG sites in subtelomeric loci (within 4\u00e2 \u20ac...Mb of the telomere) (P < 0.01), and also at loci in imprinted regions (P < 0.001). Our results pave the way for further investigations to help elucidate the relationships between telomere length, DNA methylation and gene expression in health and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Binding Sites", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cluster Analysis", "CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Genomic Imprinting", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Leukocytes", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Signal Transduction", "Telomere", "Telomere Homeostasis", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription Initiation Site", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84900848092", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57203074604": {"Name": "Buxton J.L.", "AuthorID": "57203074604", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of InvestigativeMedicine, Department of Medicine, ImperialCollege London"}, "57214957661": {"Name": "Blakemore A.I.F.", "AuthorID": "57214957661", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of InvestigativeMedicine, Department of Medicine, ImperialCollege London"}, "8675316400": {"Name": "Suderman M.", "AuthorID": "8675316400", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University"}, "57216999450": {"Name": "McArdle W.", "AuthorID": "57216999450", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "7006667863": {"Name": "Pappas J.J.", "AuthorID": "7006667863", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "7005418666": {"Name": "Szyf M.", "AuthorID": "7005418666", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University"}, "12240063800": {"Name": "Borghol N.", "AuthorID": "12240063800", "AffiliationID": "60112476, 60068774", "AffiliationName": "Lebanese International University and Lebanese University"}, "7005466807": {"Name": "Hertzman C.", "AuthorID": "7005466807", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "57203229564": {"Name": "Power C.", "AuthorID": "57203229564", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006415948": {"Name": "Pembrey M.", "AuthorID": "7006415948", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
