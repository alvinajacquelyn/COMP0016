Prospective motion correction (PMC) \u2013 demonstrated to improve 3D-T1 image quality in a pediatric population \u2013 was applied to high-resolution 3D-T2-FLAIR scans in adult epilepsy patients to evaluate its clinical benefit. Coronal 3D-T2-FLAIR scans were acquired with a 1 mm isotropic resolution on a 3 T MRI scanner. Two expert neuroradiologists reviewed 40 scans without PMC and 40 with navigator-based PMC. Visual assessment addressed six criteria of image quality (resolution, SNR, WM-GM contrast, intensity homogeneity, lesion conspicuity, diagnostic confidence) on a seven-point Likert scale (from non-diagnostic to outstanding). SNR was also objectively quantified within the white matter. PMC scans had near-identical scores on the criteria of image quality to non-PMC scans, with the notable exception that intensity homogeneity was generally worse. Using PMC, the percentage of scans with bad image quality was substantially lower than without PMC (3.25% vs. 12.5%) on the other five criteria. Quantitative SNR estimates revealed that PMC and non-PMC had no significant difference in SNR (P = 0.07). Application of prospective motion correction to 3D-T2-FLAIR sequences decreased the percentage of low-quality scans, reducing the number of scans that need to be repeated to obtain clinically useful data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy", "FLAIR", "Image quality", "Prospective motion correction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Artifacts", "Brain", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044524090", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57190488768": {"Name": "Hill A.", "AuthorID": "57190488768", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24172309000": {"Name": "Winston G.", "AuthorID": "24172309000", "AffiliationID": "60030616, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Laboratory, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24776681400": {"Name": "Micallef C.", "AuthorID": "24776681400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiological Academic Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
