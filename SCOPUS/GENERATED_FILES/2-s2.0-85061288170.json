We consider the family of operators H(\u03b5):=-d2dx2+\u03b5V in R with almost-periodic potential V. We study the behaviour of the integrated density of states (IDS) N(H ( \u03b5 ) ; \u03bb) when \u03b5\u2192 0 and \u03bb is a fixed energy. When V is quasi-periodic (i.e. is a finite sum of complex exponentials), we prove that for each \u03bb the IDS has a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of \u03b5; these powers are either integer, or in some special cases half-integer. These results are new even for periodic V. We also prove that when the potential is neither periodic nor quasi-periodic, there is an exceptional set S of energies (which we call the super-resonance set) such that for any \u03bb\u2209S there is a complete power asymptotic expansion of IDS, and when \u03bb\u2208S, then even two-terms power asymptotic expansion does not exist. We also show that the super-resonant set S is uncountable, but has measure zero. Finally, we prove that the length of any spectral gap of H ( \u03b5 ) has a complete asymptotic expansion in natural powers of \u03b5 when \u03b5\u2192 0.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061288170", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"]], "AuthorData": {"13608982300": {"Name": "Parnovski L.", "AuthorID": "13608982300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "25634557200": {"Name": "Shterenberg R.", "AuthorID": "25634557200", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}}}
