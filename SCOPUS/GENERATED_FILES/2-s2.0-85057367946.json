We investigate the information on which these confidence judgments are based, and how they relate to the decision itself, by studying how fluctuations in perceptual information influence decisions and second-order metacognitive evaluations of confidence and accuracy. Human participants judged which of two dynamically changing stimuli contained more dots, under instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy. Crucially, stimuli remained visible for one second after the decision, before participants rated their confidence in their choice. We found that confidence and error detection depended on the balance of stimulus evidence accumulated in the periods both preceding and following the initial decision, regardless of whether instructions emphasized speed or accuracy. These findings suggest a shared computational basis for error detection and confidence judgments, with implications for current models of metacognitive evaluation of decision processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Confidence", "Decision making", "Error detection", "Metacognition", "Reverse correlation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Choice Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Mathematical Concepts", "Metacognition", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057367946", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"35200477200": {"Name": "Charles L.", "AuthorID": "35200477200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "6603836808": {"Name": "Yeung N.", "AuthorID": "6603836808", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
