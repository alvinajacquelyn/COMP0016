However, little is known about the biochemical pathways driving LV dysfunction after MI. To identify novel biomarkers predicting post-MI LVEF and ISZ, we performed metabolic profiling in the GIPS-III randomized clinical trial (Glycometabolic Intervention as Adjunct to Primary Percutaneous Intervention in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction). We also investigated the metabolic footprint of metformin, a drug associated with improved post-MI LV function in experimental studies. Methods and Results - Participants were patients with ST-segment-elevated MI who were randomly assigned to receive metformin or placebo for 4 months. Blood samples were obtained on admission, 24 hours post-MI, and 4 months post-MI. A total of 233 metabolite measures were quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. LVEF and ISZ were assessed 4 months post-MI. Twenty-four hours post-MI measurements of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) triglycerides (HDL-TG) predicted LVEF (\u03b2=1.90 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82 to 2.98]; P=6.4\u00d710-4) and ISZ (\u03b2=-0.41 [95% CI, -0.60 to -0.21]; P=3.2\u00d710-5). In addition, 24 hours post-MI measurements of medium HDL-TG (\u03b2=-0.40 [95% CI, -0.60 to -0.20]; P=6.4\u00d72\u00d710-5), small HDL-TG (\u03b2=-0.34 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.14]; P=7.3\u00d710-4), and the triglyceride content of very large HDL (\u03b2=-0.38 [95% CI, -0.58 to -0.18]; P=2.7\u00d710-4) were associated with ISZ. After the 4-month treatment, the phospholipid content of very large HDL was lower in metformin than in placebo-treated patients (28.89% versus 38.79%; P=7.5\u00d710-5); alanine levels were higher in the metformin group (0.46 versus 0.44 mmol/L; P=2.4\u00d710-4). Conclusions - HDL triglyceride concentrations predict post-MI LVEF and ISZ. Metformin increases alanine levels and reduces the phospholipid content in very large HDL particles.
