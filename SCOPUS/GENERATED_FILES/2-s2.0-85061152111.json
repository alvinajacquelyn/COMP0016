In its explorations of meaning, multimodality, communication and emerging language practices, the book includes theoretical and empirical chapters that move toward an understanding of communication in its dynamic complexity, and its social semiotic and situated character. It relocates current debates in linguistics and in multimodality, as well as conceptions of centers/margins, by re-conceptualizing communicative practice through investigation of indigenous/oral communities, street art performances, migration contexts, recycling artefacts and signage repurposing. The book takes an innovative approach to both the form and content of its scholarly writing, and will be of interest to all those involved in interdisciplinary thinking, researching and writing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061152111", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55362190300": {"Name": "Sherris A.", "AuthorID": "55362190300", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "College of Education and Human Performance, Texas A and M University"}, "35239693700": {"Name": "Adami E.", "AuthorID": "35239693700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Languages, Cultures and Societies, University of Leeds"}}}
