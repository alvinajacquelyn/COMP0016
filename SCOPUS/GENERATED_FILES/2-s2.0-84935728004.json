The recognition and the differential diagnosis is challenging, particularly in young children. Arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) is the primary diagnosis to be considered as this requires emergency investigations and management; however, there are several conditions collectively described as 'stroke mimics' that need consideration. Accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate management. Clinical data combined with neuroimaging are important for accurate diagnosis and management. This review and the accompanying illustrative case vignettes suggest a practical approach to differential diagnosis and management of children presenting with acute hemiparesis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Humans", "Paresis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935728004", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15520905100": {"Name": "Bhate S.", "AuthorID": "15520905100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102334584": {"Name": "Ganesan V.", "AuthorID": "7102334584", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neuroscience, UCL institute of child health, University college London"}}}
