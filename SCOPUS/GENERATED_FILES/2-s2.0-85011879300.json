In particular, we show how living in London influenced the attitudes of Central and East European migrants towards pre-marital sex and homosexuality. While the general acceptability of pre-marital sex was not affected by time spent in London, differences were noted in the meaning attached to sex outside marriage in the United Kingdom compared with Central and Eastern Europe. Particularly significant changes were observed in our respondents\u2019 attitudes towards homosexuality, with a greater liberalisation the result of extrication from mechanisms of social control, re-socialisation into new social norms regarding sex and sexuality, greater visibility of sexual difference in London and, in particular, inter-personal contacts with gays and lesbians. Limitations to the general liberalisation of attitudes were also noted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central and Eastern Europe", "homosexuality", "London", "migration", "pre-marital sex", "sexual attitudes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011879300", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"22951495800": {"Name": "Mole R.C.M.", "AuthorID": "22951495800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London"}, "8592870000": {"Name": "Gerry C.J.", "AuthorID": "8592870000", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, Management and Policy, HSE University"}, "35243427800": {"Name": "Parutis V.", "AuthorID": "35243427800", "AffiliationID": "60102147", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}, "7006284234": {"Name": "Burns F.M.", "AuthorID": "7006284234", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
