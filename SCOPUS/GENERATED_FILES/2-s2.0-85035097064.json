It looks beyond the resource-opportunity framework and occupational choice: culture and values matter. Yet, instead of assigning the latter to specific ethnic features, they are related here to both immigration and to the social environment defined by the share of immigrants, and by ethnic diversity. Empirical evidence provided in this paper is based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) UK data, 2003\u201313. Having more immigrants in the locality enhances entrepreneurship. With an increase in ethnic diversity the likelihood of being engaged in start-up activity decreases then increases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diversity", "entrepreneurship", "ethnicity", "Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)", "migration", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035097064", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6602242626": {"Name": "Mickiewicz T.", "AuthorID": "6602242626", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Economics, Finance & Entrepreneurship Department, Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "7201808549": {"Name": "Hart M.", "AuthorID": "7201808549", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Economics, Finance & Entrepreneurship Department, Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "57191499661": {"Name": "Nyakudya F.", "AuthorID": "57191499661", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Economics, Finance & Entrepreneurship Department, Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "24725430400": {"Name": "Theodorakopoulos N.", "AuthorID": "24725430400", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Work & Organisational Psychology Department, Aston Business School, Aston University"}}}
