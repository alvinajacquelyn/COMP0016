These signals represent attractive cardioprotective targets, but the underlying mechanisms of genesis are ill-defined. Here, we investigated the role of the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), which is known in several cell types to induce Ca2+ oscillations that initiate from acidic stores such as lysosomes, likely via two-pore channels (TPCs, TPC1 and 2). Methods and results An NAADP antagonist called Ned-K was developed by rational design based on a previously existing scaffold. Ned-K suppressed Ca2+ oscillations and dramatically protected cardiomyocytes from cell death in vitro after ischaemia and reoxygenation, preventing opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Ned-K profoundly decreased infarct size in mice in vivo. Transgenic mice lacking the endo-lysosomal TPC1 were also protected from injury. Conclusion NAADP signalling plays a major role in reperfusion-induced cell death and represents a potent pathway for protection against reperfusion injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium", "Ischaemia", "Lysosomes", "NAADP", "Reperfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Carbolines", "Cytoprotection", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitochondria, Heart", "Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mitochondrial Swelling", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "NADP", "Piperazines", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950321056", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "57192273219": {"Name": "Foote K.", "AuthorID": "57192273219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "36446055900": {"Name": "Kunuthur S.", "AuthorID": "36446055900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "55213156000": {"Name": "Tan N.", "AuthorID": "55213156000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "41562209300": {"Name": "Tyser R.", "AuthorID": "41562209300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "15720841800": {"Name": "Gosain R.", "AuthorID": "15720841800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "56374610700": {"Name": "Zhao Y.J.", "AuthorID": "56374610700", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Li Ka Shing School of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "7003614053": {"Name": "Graeff R.", "AuthorID": "7003614053", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Li Ka Shing School of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "7006223453": {"Name": "Ganesan A.", "AuthorID": "7006223453", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
