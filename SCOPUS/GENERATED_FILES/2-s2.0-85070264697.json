Authors have begun adopting positive psychology measures developed with other populations but there is no consensus around which are more appropriate or psychometrically robust. A systematic search identified measures used between 1998 and 2017 and an appraisal of the development procedure was undertaken using standardised criteria enabling the awarding of scores based on reporting of psychometric information. Twelve measures within the constructs of identity, hope, religiosity/spirituality, life valuation, self-efficacy, community and wellbeing were identified as being used within 17 dementia studies. Development procedures were variable and scores on development criterion reflected this variability. Of the measures included, the Herth Hope Index, Systems of Belief Inventory and Psychological Wellbeing Scale appeared to be the most robustly developed and appropriate for people with dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s", "community", "dementia", "hope", "outcome measures", "psychometrics", "spirituality", "wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070264697", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56868402000": {"Name": "Stoner C.R.", "AuthorID": "56868402000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London"}, "57147831400": {"Name": "Stansfeld J.", "AuthorID": "57147831400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
