However, it has been suggested that local signal distortion from the lead itself renders its depiction on MRI unreliable. OBJECTIVE: To compare lead location on stereotactic MRI with subsequent location of its brain track after removal. METHODS: Patients underwent deep brain stimulation with the use of MRI-guided and MRI-verified Leksell frame approach. Infection or suboptimal efficacy required lead removal and subsequent reimplantation by using the same technique. Postimplantation stereotactic MR images were analyzed. Lateral (x) and anteroposterior (y) distances from midcommissural point to center of the lead hypointensity were recorded at the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane (pallidal electrode) or z = 24 (subthalamic electrode). Stereotactic MRI before the second procedure, x and y distances from the center of the visible lead track hypointensity to midcommissural point were independently recorded. Vectorial distance from center of the lead hypointensity to the center of its track was calculated. RESULTS: Sixteen electrode tracks were studied in 10 patients. Mean differences between lead artifact location and lead track location were: x coordinate 0.4 mm \u00b1 0.2; y coordinate 0.6 mm \u00b1 0.3. Mean vectorial distance was 0.7 mm \u00b1 0.2. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic distance between lead location and subsequent brain track location on MRI was small. The mean discrepancy was approximately half the deep brain stimulation lead width. This suggests that lead hypointensity seen on postimplantation MRI is indeed an accurate representation of its real location within deep brain structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "Magnetic resonance imaging-verified surgery", "Stereotactic accuracy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Artifacts", "Brain", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Globus Pallidus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Parkinson Disease", "Reproducibility of Results", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Subthalamic Nucleus", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989237223", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.A.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "23768093200": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "23768093200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
