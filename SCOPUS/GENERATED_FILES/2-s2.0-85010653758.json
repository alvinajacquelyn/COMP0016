Experimentation in 3-D presents challenges, especially with virulent pathogens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kills more humans than any other infection and is characterised by a spatially organised immune response and extracellular matrix remodelling. We developed a 3-D system incorporating virulent mycobacteria, primary human blood mononuclear cells and collagen-alginate matrix to dissect the host-pathogen interaction. Infection in 3-D led to greater cellular survival and permitted longitudinal analysis over 21 days. Key features of human tuberculosis develop, and extracellular matrix integrity favours the host over the pathogen. We optimised multiparameter readouts to study emerging therapeutic interventions: cytokine supplementation, host-directed therapy and immunoaugmentation. Each intervention modulates the host-pathogen interaction, but has both beneficial and harmful effects. This methodology has wide applicability to investigate infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases and develop novel drug regimes and vaccination approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alginates", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "Chemokine CCL2", "Chemokine CXCL10", "Coculture Techniques", "Collagen", "Dinoprostone", "Extracellular Matrix", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glucuronic Acid", "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Hexuronic Acids", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Interleukin-12", "Interleukin-1beta", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Microspheres", "Models, Biological", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Spheroids, Cellular", "Virulence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010653758", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"37028972600": {"Name": "Tezera L.B.", "AuthorID": "37028972600", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "35558142200": {"Name": "Bielecka M.K.", "AuthorID": "35558142200", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57193083633": {"Name": "Chancellor A.", "AuthorID": "57193083633", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "56157355700": {"Name": "Reichmann M.T.", "AuthorID": "56157355700", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57193081972": {"Name": "Brace P.", "AuthorID": "57193081972", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57193088885": {"Name": "Batty A.", "AuthorID": "57193088885", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57221797217": {"Name": "Tocheva A.", "AuthorID": "57221797217", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6602450452": {"Name": "Jogai S.", "AuthorID": "6602450452", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "7202280116": {"Name": "Marshall B.G.", "AuthorID": "7202280116", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "55911967000": {"Name": "Tebruegge M.", "AuthorID": "55911967000", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "36787177700": {"Name": "Mansour S.", "AuthorID": "36787177700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "57194531731": {"Name": "Elkington P.T.", "AuthorID": "57194531731", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "56154766200": {"Name": "Shammari B.A.", "AuthorID": "56154766200", "AffiliationID": "60078536", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Department of Infectious Diseases, MNGHA"}, "7005843306": {"Name": "Jayasinghe S.N.", "AuthorID": "7005843306", "AffiliationID": "60176024, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "BioPhysics Group, UCL Institute of Biomedical Engineering, UCL Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
