We show that the dissipation acts to bias the quantum trajectories towards a reduced phase space. This model applies to a system of superconducting flux qubits whose coupling to the environment is necessarily anisotropic. We study the model in the context of the D-Wave computing device and show that the form of environmental coupling in this case produces dynamics that are closely related to several models proposed on phenomenological grounds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dissipative dynamics", "Dissipative model", "Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert", "Microscopic modeling", "Quantum trajectories", "Superconducting flux", "Thermal bath", "Wave computing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006162991", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55601715700": {"Name": "Crowley P.J.D.", "AuthorID": "55601715700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57214131111": {"Name": "Green A.G.", "AuthorID": "57214131111", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
