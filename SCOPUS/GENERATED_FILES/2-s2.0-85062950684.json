The assays were validated for the 13 PnPS included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). As recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), we compared the ECL assays with the WHO reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and derived a threshold corresponding to the 0.35 \u00b5g/mL threshold established for the WHO reference ELISA for the non-inferiority comparison and licensure of new PCVs against invasive pneumococcal disease. Methods: A panel of 452 serum samples from children vaccinated with one of the three licensed PCVs was assessed with the ECL assays and the WHO reference ELISA. The ECL assay threshold for the aggregated seven PnPS included in the 7-valent PCV (PCV7) and serotype-specific thresholds were determined using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve-based approach and Deming regression. To evaluate concordance between the ECL assays and the WHO reference ELISA, serostatus agreement rates between both assays and geometric means of the ratios (GMRs) of concentrations obtained with both assays were calculated. Results: The thresholds for the seven aggregated PCV7 serotypes obtained with the ROC curve-based approach and Deming regression approximated 0.35 \u00b5g/mL (0.38 and 0.34 \u00b5g/mL, respectively). Individual thresholds for the PCV13 serotypes ranged between 0.24 and 0.51 \u00b5g/mL across both approaches. Serostatus agreement rates using a 0.35 \u00b5g/mL threshold for both assays were \u226586.9% for all PCV13 serotypes. GMRs ranged between 0.85 and 1.25 for 11/13 serotypes and were <1.29 for the two remaining serotypes. Conclusion: The ECL assays were comparable to the WHO reference ELISA and offer a sensitive, time- and serum volume-saving method to quantify serotype-specific anti-PnPS antibodies in pediatric sera. A 0.35 \u00b5g/mL threshold will be used for each PCV13 serotype to assess PCV immunogenicity in clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bridging", "Concordance", "Electrochemiluminescence assay", "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay", "Pneumococcal polysaccharides", "Threshold"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Bacterial", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine", "Humans", "Luminescent Measurements", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Pneumococcal Vaccines", "Polysaccharides, Bacterial", "Reproducibility of Results", "ROC Curve", "Serogroup", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062950684", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"15755085700": {"Name": "Feyssaguet M.", "AuthorID": "15755085700", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57207818512": {"Name": "Bellanger A.", "AuthorID": "57207818512", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57207826383": {"Name": "Nozay F.", "AuthorID": "57207826383", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57207834788": {"Name": "Malev\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "57207834788", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57207830905": {"Name": "Lallemand S.", "AuthorID": "57207830905", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57207835343": {"Name": "El Moussaoui A.", "AuthorID": "57207835343", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57191982259": {"Name": "Schoonbroodt S.", "AuthorID": "57191982259", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "56906794500": {"Name": "Friel D.", "AuthorID": "56906794500", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57207830012": {"Name": "Merck E.", "AuthorID": "57207830012", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "6508387675": {"Name": "Verlant V.", "AuthorID": "6508387675", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK"}, "57196474859": {"Name": "De Gorguette D'Argoeuves P.", "AuthorID": "57196474859", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57207818322": {"Name": "Jones T.", "AuthorID": "57207818322", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
