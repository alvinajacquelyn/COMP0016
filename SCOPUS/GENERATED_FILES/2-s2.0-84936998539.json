We compare the effectiveness of this relatively recent numerical method with the traditional Godunov-based cell transmission method on various aspects including modelling shocks, dispersion of vehicle platoons, moving bottlenecks, and traffic characteristics with respect to real-world observations made in Central London, UK. The results suggest that the variational method is able to produce high-quality estimates both theoretically and empirically. This study opens up a new research direction in the area of urban traffic modelling and optimisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell transmission method", "Godunov scheme", "multi-modal networks", "urban journey times", "variational method"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936998539", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"36146863600": {"Name": "Chow A.H.F.", "AuthorID": "36146863600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "56206579500": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "56206579500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "7003652508": {"Name": "Szeto W.Y.", "AuthorID": "7003652508", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "55568512389": {"Name": "Wang D.Z.W.", "AuthorID": "55568512389", "AffiliationID": "60118451, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
