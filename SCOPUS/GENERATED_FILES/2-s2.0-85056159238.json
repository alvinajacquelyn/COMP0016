The mothers of young children (1\u20137 years) with epilepsy and mothers of children with neurodisability in a defined geographical area of the UK, completed the Parenting Stress Index\u20144th Edition (PSI-4) and a measure of perceived stigma. Factors associated with parenting stress and stigma were analyzed using linear regression. Thirty-eight percent of mothers of children with epilepsy scored in the at-risk range (> 85th percentile) on the Total Stress score of the PSI-4 (Neurodisability 21%) (p = 0.06). Significantly more mothers of children with epilepsy scored in the at-risk range on the Parent\u2013Child Dysfunctional Interaction subscale than mothers of children with neurodisability (Epilepsy 45% vs. Neurodisability 21%; p = 0.01), but not on the Parental Distress subscale (Epilepsy 32% vs. Neurodisability 23%; p = 0.33) or Difficult Child (Epilepsy 57% vs. Neurodisability 46%; p = 0.26) subscales. There was no statistically significant difference in perceived stigma between mothers in both groups (p = 0.51). Factors significantly associated with increased parenting stress in the group with epilepsy were child behavior difficulties (p < 0.001) and maternal sleep difficulties (p = 0.02). Lower child developmental level was the only factor independently associated with increased stigma in the group with epilepsy (p = 0.08). Mothers of young children with epilepsy report high levels of parenting stress and higher levels of difficulties with parent\u2013child interaction compared with that of mothers of children with nonepilepsy-related neurodisability. Parenting stress and stigma in epilepsy were not associated with epilepsy factors. Efforts at reducing parenting stress and stigma should focus on interventions targeting child development and maternal sleep.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Epilepsy", "Mothers", "Parenting stress", "Stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child, Preschool", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Mothers", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parenting", "Principal Component Analysis", "Regression Analysis", "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders", "Social Stigma", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056159238", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH)"}, "57118580300": {"Name": "Jones C.", "AuthorID": "57118580300", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "23093844000": {"Name": "Dabydeen L.", "AuthorID": "23093844000", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, Great Ormond Street"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH)"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}, "7402223872": {"Name": "Das K.B.", "AuthorID": "7402223872", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, Great Ormond Street"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60031576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont College of Medicine"}, "23968672700": {"Name": "Atkinson P.", "AuthorID": "23968672700", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}, "57200498701": {"Name": "Memon A.", "AuthorID": "57200498701", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}}}
