To develop vectors for therapeutic approaches, targeting optogenetic constructs to interneurons is therefore a key requirement. We investigated whether the interneuron-specific promoters glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)67 and cholecystokinin (CCK) allowed targeted lentiviral delivery of opsins to interneurons as a whole, or specifically CCK+ interneurons. Methods: We generated lentiviral (LV) plasmids encoding channelrhodopsin (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) tagged with fluorophores and driven by GAD67 or CCK promoters. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and LV vectors carrying opsins driven by pyramidal cell promoters were used as controls. We transduced neuronal cultures and rodent brain in vivo, immunostained specimens 6-8 weeks after in vivo injection and 7-14 days after in vitro transduction, and evaluated volume and specificity of expression by confocal microscopy. Results: In vitro, 90% (19/21) of LV-CCK-NpHR2.0-EYFP expressing neurons were CCK+. In vivo, LV-GAD67-ChR2-mCherry was expressed in 2.6% (5/193), LV-GAD67-NpHR2.0-EYFP in approximately 15% (43/279) and LV-CCK-NpHR2.0-EYFP in 47% (9/19) of hippocampal GABA+ interneurons. GAD67 vectors expressed in larger volumes than CCK-driven constructs. AAV vector controls achieved the largest expression volumes. Conclusions: LV-CCK-NpHR2.0-EYFP may be useful for targeting CCK+ interneurons in culture. GAD67/CCK-driven lentiviral constructs are expressed in vivo, although expression is not specific for interneurons. Overall, expression levels are low compared to opsins driven by pyramidal cell promoters. A better understanding of GAD67 and CCK promoter structure or alternative techniques is required to reliably target opsins to interneurons using viral vectors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adenoassocated virus (AAV)", "Gene - delivery", "Microscopy", "Neuroscience", "Retroviruses", "Virology - lentiviruses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Cholecystokinin", "Dependovirus", "Genetic Vectors", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Halorhodopsins", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Interneurons", "Lentivirus", "Male", "Optogenetics", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Pyramidal Cells", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Rhodopsin", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961858394", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56041626900": {"Name": "Mantoan Ritter L.", "AuthorID": "56041626900", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Department, King's College NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507085620": {"Name": "Schorge S.", "AuthorID": "6507085620", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56548026100": {"Name": "Macdonald D.", "AuthorID": "56548026100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "26643231400": {"Name": "Collins M.", "AuthorID": "26643231400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57188587334": {"Name": "Ritter G.", "AuthorID": "57188587334", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology Research Institute, University of Hertfordshire"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunomodulation, Navarrabiomed"}, "36112767000": {"Name": "Chiara F.", "AuthorID": "36112767000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6507318934": {"Name": "Cariboni A.", "AuthorID": "6507318934", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, Univeristy of Milan"}}}
