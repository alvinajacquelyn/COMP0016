We aimed to investigate how differences between young and older adults vary across 11 high-income countries. Methods A total of 20,045 participants from 11 high-income countries (i.e., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States) participating in the Commonwealth Fund 2013 International Health Policy Survey. We compared young adults (18-24 years) with older adults (25-34; 35-49; 50-64; 65+ years) on three aspects of health care: overall satisfaction, cost barriers to access, and four indicators of consultation quality relating to adequate information, time, involvement, and explanation. Results Across all participants, young adults reported significantly worse overall satisfaction (63.6% vs. 70.3%; p <.001) and more frequent cost barriers (21.3% vs. 15.2%; p <.001) than older adults. Country-level analyses showed that young adults reported lower overall satisfaction than older adults in five of 11 countries (Australia, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, United States) and more frequent cost barriers in six of 11 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, United States). In five countries (Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Switzerland), most patient experience indicators were less positive among young adults than those among older adults. In three countries (Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom), there was no significant difference between young and older adults on any indicator. Conclusions Associations between age and health care access/experience varied markedly between countries, suggesting that poor access and experience among young adults is not inevitable and may be amenable to policy/practice interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Access and evaluation", "Health care quality", "Health care systems", "Patient experience", "Young adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Distribution", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Community-Based Participatory Research", "Cost of Illness", "Developed Countries", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "Health Services Accessibility", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942192075", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"40461756100": {"Name": "Hargreaves D.S.", "AuthorID": "40461756100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57211346256": {"Name": "Greaves F.", "AuthorID": "57211346256", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "26633007800": {"Name": "Levay C.", "AuthorID": "26633007800", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Business Administration, Lund University"}, "7102556862": {"Name": "Mitchell I.", "AuthorID": "7102556862", "AffiliationID": "60008950, 60016880", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Australian National University, Canberra Hospital"}, "56730095300": {"Name": "Koch U.", "AuthorID": "56730095300", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Primary Care, University of Z\u00fcrich, Universit\u00e4tsSpital Z\u00fcrich"}, "7003429520": {"Name": "Esch T.", "AuthorID": "7003429520", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "7004257277": {"Name": "Denny S.", "AuthorID": "7004257277", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Child and Youth Health, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "7004011988": {"Name": "Frich J.C.", "AuthorID": "7004011988", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Management and Health Economics, University of Oslo"}, "8084240400": {"Name": "Struijs J.", "AuthorID": "8084240400", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM)"}, "7202522962": {"Name": "Sheikh A.", "AuthorID": "7202522962", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60110825", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Sciences, Medical School"}}}
