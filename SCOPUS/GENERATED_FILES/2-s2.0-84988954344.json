We examined the impact of previousmicrovascular and macrovascular disease on the risk of major PAD in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed 10,624 patients with type 2 diabetes free frombaselinemajor PAD in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) clinical trial. The primary composite outcome was major PAD defined as PAD-induced death, peripheral revascularization, lowerlimb amputation, or chronic ulceration. The secondary end points were the PAD components considered separately. RESULTS Major PAD occurred in 620 (5.8%) participants during 5 years of follow-up. Baseline microvascular and macrovascular disease were both associated with subsequent risk of major PAD after adjustment for age, sex, region of origin, and randomized treatments. However, only microvascular disease remained significantly associated with PAD after further adjustment for established risk factors. The highest risk was observed in participants with a history of macroalbuminuria (hazard ratio 1.91 [95% CI 1.38-2.64], P < 0.0001) and retinal photocoagulation therapy (1.60 [1.11-2.32], P = 0.01). Baseline microvascular disease was also associated with a higher risk of chronic lower-limb ulceration (2.07 [1.56-2.75], P < 0.0001) and amputation (1.59 [1.15-2.22], P = 0.006),whereas baselinemacrovascular disease was associatedwith a higher rate of angioplasty procedures (1.75 [1.13-2.73], P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Microvascular disease, particularly macroalbuminuria and retinal photocoagulation therapy, strongly predicts major PAD in patients with type 2 diabetes, but macrovascular disease does not.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Drug Combinations", "Endpoint Determination", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gliclazide", "Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated", "Humans", "Indapamide", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Perindopril", "Peripheral Arterial Disease", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988954344", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"24173541600": {"Name": "Mohammedi K.", "AuthorID": "24173541600", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney"}, "7102510958": {"Name": "Woodward M.", "AuthorID": "7102510958", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University"}, "36137193200": {"Name": "Hirakawa Y.", "AuthorID": "36137193200", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney"}, "6603071699": {"Name": "Zoungas S.", "AuthorID": "6603071699", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "55585900000": {"Name": "Rodgers A.", "AuthorID": "55585900000", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney"}, "57218390053": {"Name": "Neal B.", "AuthorID": "57218390053", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney"}, "54912078200": {"Name": "Chalmers J.", "AuthorID": "54912078200", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London (UCL), UCL Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56764050000": {"Name": "Lisheng L.", "AuthorID": "56764050000", "AffiliationID": "112932445", "AffiliationName": "Chinese Hypertension League Institute"}, "36039693200": {"Name": "Mancia G.", "AuthorID": "36039693200", "AffiliationID": "60012306, 60006646", "AffiliationName": "University of Milan-Bicocca, Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "7005401249": {"Name": "Harrap S.", "AuthorID": "7005401249", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "57190092171": {"Name": "Marre M.", "AuthorID": "57190092171", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, UFR de M\u00e9decine"}}}
