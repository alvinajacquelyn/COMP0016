All rights reserved.The performance and portability of a multiplex real-time PCR assay to detect KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like and VIM carbapenemase gene families from bacterial isolates was assessed using Rotor-Gene Q and ABI 7500 instruments. Gram-negative bacterial isolates (n = 502) were comprised of 100 isolates each with KPC, NDM, VIM or OXA-48-like carbapenemases (including 17 with OXA-181) and 2 isolates with NDM + OXA-48-like enzymes (including 1 with OXA-181) as well as 100 assay-negative isolates comprised of 24 IMP-producers, 24 carbapenem-resistant isolates with no known carbapenemase gene and 52 extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing carbapenem-susceptible isolates. A multicentre evaluation was carried out in five laboratories using a subset of 100 isolates comprised of 22 isolates each with KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like or VIM alleles and 12 isolates that were negative for the assay targets. Initial validation of the assay on both the Rotor-Gene Q and ABI 7500 instruments demonstrated 100% sensitivity amongst the 402 isolates that were positive for KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like (including OXA-181) and VIM carbapenemase genes, whilst the 100 assay-negative samples were correctly identified indicating 100% specificity. During the multicentre evaluation the same 100% level of sensitivity and specificity was observed in each of the five centres that participated. Neither invalid nor false-positive results were observed. In conclusion, the assay offers a portable and reliable option for the detection of bacteria carrying clinically significant carbapenemases encoded by KPC, NDM, VIM and OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes using either of the two most common real-time PCR instrument platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enterobacteriaceae", "KPC", "Metallo-\u03b2-lactamase", "NDM", "OXA-48", "VIM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "beta-Lactamases", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Humans", "Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956940980", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"11138831400": {"Name": "Ellington M.J.", "AuthorID": "11138831400", "AffiliationID": "60016390, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Clinical and Public Health Microbiology Laboratory, Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "42461482400": {"Name": "Findlay J.", "AuthorID": "42461482400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Asso.
