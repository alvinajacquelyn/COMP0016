In two separate experiments, we demonstrated that tDCS enhanced WM precision when applied bilaterally over the PPC, independent of electrode configuration. In a third experiment, we demonstrated with unilateral electrode configuration over the right PPC, that only cathodal tDCS enhanced WM precision and only when baseline performance was low. Looking at the effects on underlying sources of error, we found that cathodal stimulation enhanced the probability of correct target response across all participants by reducing feature-misbinding. Only for low-baseline performers, cathodal stimulation also reduced variability of recall. We conclude that cathodal- but not anodal tDCS can improve WM precision by preventing feature-misbinding and hereby enhancing attentional selection. For low-baseline performers, cathodal tDCS also protects the memory trace. Furthermore, stimulation over bilateral PPC is more potent than unilateral cathodal tDCS in enhancing general WM precision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Error source", "Parietal cortex", "Polarity", "Precision", "Transcranial direct current stimulation", "Visual working memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Attention", "Eye Movement Measurements", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parietal Lobe", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968572579", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7004184032": {"Name": "Heinen K.", "AuthorID": "7004184032", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7003283459": {"Name": "Cappelletti M.", "AuthorID": "7003283459", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "7201522757": {"Name": "Husain M.", "AuthorID": "7201522757", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "55541017100": {"Name": "Sagliano L.", "AuthorID": "55541017100", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Second University of Naples"}, "56413002900": {"Name": "Candini M.", "AuthorID": "56413002900", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bologna"}, "24759423400": {"Name": "Zokaei N.", "AuthorID": "24759423400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}}}
