We analyzed the molecular evolutionary changes in the attachment (G) glycoprotein of RSV-A viruses collected over 13 epidemic seasons (2000 to 2012) in Kilifi (n=649), Kenya, and contemporaneous sequences (n=1,131) collected elsewhere within Kenya and 28 other countries. Genetic diversity in the G gene in Kilifi was dynamic both within and between epidemics, characterized by frequent new variant introductions and limited variant persistence between consecutive epidemics. Four RSV-A genotypes were detected in Kilifi: ON1 (11.9%), GA2 (75.5%), GA5 (12.3%), and GA3 (0.3%), with predominant genotype replacement of GA5 by GA2 and then GA2 by ON1. Within these genotypes, there was considerable variation in potential N-glycosylation sites, with GA2 and ON1 viruses showing up to 15 different patterns involving eight possible sites. Further, we identified 15 positively selected and 34 genotype-distinguishing codon sites, with six of these sites exhibiting both characteristics. The mean substitution rate of the G ectodomain for the Kilifi data set was estimated at 3.58\u00d710-3 (95% highest posterior density interval=3.04 to 4.16) nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Kilifi viruses were interspersed in the global phylogenetic tree, clustering mostly with Kenyan and European sequences. Our findings highlight ongoing genetic evolution and high diversity of circulating RSV-A strains, locally and globally, with potential antigenic differences. Taken together, these provide a possible explanation on the nature of recurrent local RSV epidemics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cluster Analysis", "Epidemics", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genes, Viral", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Humans", "Kenya", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Phylogeny", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977178374", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57210894285": {"Name": "Otieno J.R.", "AuthorID": "57210894285", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "36489084300": {"Name": "Agoti C.N.", "AuthorID": "36489084300", "AffiliationID": "60107199", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Pwani University"}, "55918403800": {"Name": "Gitahi C.W.", "AuthorID": "55918403800", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "24342655600": {"Name": "Bett A.", "AuthorID": "24342655600", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "6506000715": {"Name": "Ngama M.", "AuthorID": "6506000715", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "57190074933": {"Name": "James Nokesa D.", "AuthorID": "57190074933", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences and WIDER, University of Warwick"}, "7005195578": {"Name": "Medley G.F.", "AuthorID": "7005195578", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004646930": {"Name": "Cane P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004646930", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}}}
