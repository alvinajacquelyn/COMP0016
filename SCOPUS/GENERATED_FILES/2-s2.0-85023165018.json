Davidoff Claudio Sorio, Amit Chunilal Nathwani, and Marco Della Peruta.We have developed a humanized bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), a cell surface antigen present on a range of malignancies and cancer-initiating cells. Focusing initially on pancreatic cancer, we demonstrated that our ROR1 BiTE results in T cell mediated and antigen-specific cytotoxicity against ROR1-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro at exceedingly low concentrations (0.1 ng/mL) and low effector to target ratios. Our BiTE prevented engraftment of pancreatic tumor xenografts in murine models and reduced the size of established subcutaneous tumors by at least 3-fold. To validate its wider therapeutic potential, we next demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer in an in vitro and in vivo setting and T-cell-mediated killing of a range of histologically distinct solid tumor cell lines. Overall, our ROR1 BiTE represents a promising immunotherapy approach, because of its ability to target a broad range of malignancies, many with significant unmet therapeutic needs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Immunotherapy", "ROR1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023165018", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"55605940500": {"Name": "Gohil S.H.", "AuthorID": "55605940500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "56786510200": {"Name": "Paredes-Moscosso S.R.", "AuthorID": "56786510200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "56520513400": {"Name": "Harrasser M.", "AuthorID": "56520513400", "AffiliationID": "100513609", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre"}, "6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.C.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Oak House, Reeds Crescent"}, "16068160000": {"Name": "Della Peruta M.", "AuthorID": "16068160000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "15519823300": {"Name": "Vezzalini M.", "AuthorID": "15519823300", "AffiliationID": "60000799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona Medical School"}, "57219651556": {"Name": "Scarpa A.", "AuthorID": "57219651556", "AffiliationID": "60000799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona Medical School"}, "6603774132": {"Name": "Sorio C.", "AuthorID": "6603774132", "AffiliationID": "60000799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona Medical School"}, "8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006576814": {"Name": "Davidoff A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006576814", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}}
