P2X receptor subtypes are widely expressed in the CNS and their distributionis described in different regions. They function in synaptic cotransmission and neuromodulation, as well as in trophic signalling. ATP released from nerves and astroglial cells are predominantly involved in neuron-glial interactions. Purinergic signalling is involved in normal behaviour, including learning and memory, sleep and arousal, locomotor and feeding activities and cognition. P2X receptors participate in CNS pathophysiology, including injury, inflammation, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression and anxiety. P2X4 and P2X7 receptor antagonists are effective via microglia against neuropathic pain, while P2X3 receptor antagonists also reduce neuropathic pain, but via a differernt mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATP", "Brain stem", "Glia", "Glutamate", "Hippocampus", "Memory", "Neurodegenerative diseases", "Neuropathic pain", "Neuroprotection", "Spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Central Nervous System", "Central Nervous System Diseases", "Humans", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926451876", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University College Medical School, United Kingdom and Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Melbourne"}}}
