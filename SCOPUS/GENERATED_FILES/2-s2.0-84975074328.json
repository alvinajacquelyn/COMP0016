Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTRs) of transcripts serve as important hubs for posttranscriptional gene expression regulation. Here, we find that the exonisation of intergenic Alu elements introduced new terminal exons and polyadenylation sites during human genome evolution. While Alu exonisation from introns has been described previously, we shed light on a novel mechanism to create alternative 3\u2032 UTRs, thereby opening opportunities for differential posttranscriptional regulation. On the mechanistic level, we show that intergenic Alu exonisation can compete both with alternative splicing and polyadenylation in the upstream gene. Notably, the Alu-derived isoforms are often expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and the Alu-derived 3\u2032 UTRs can alter mRNA stability. In summary, we demonstrate that intergenic elements can affect processing of preceding genes, and elucidate how intergenic Alu exonisation can contribute to tissue-specific posttranscriptional regulation by expanding the repertoire of 3\u2032 UTRs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Alu Elements", "Cell Line", "DNA", "DNA, Intergenic", "Evolution, Molecular", "Exons", "Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group C", "Humans", "Introns", "Nuclear Proteins", "Organ Specificity", "Polyadenylation", "Protein Isoforms", "Ribonucleoproteins", "RNA", "RNA Splicing", "Splicing Factor U2AF"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975074328", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55536315900": {"Name": "Tajnik M.", "AuthorID": "55536315900", "AffiliationID": "60032694", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15754355700": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig J.", "AuthorID": "15754355700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "23986539100": {"Name": "Vigilante A.", "AuthorID": "23986539100", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK London Research Institute"}, "6701608432": {"Name": "Luscombe N.", "AuthorID": "6701608432", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"}, "14828354300": {"Name": "Zarnack K.", "AuthorID": "14828354300", "AffiliationID": "112960970", "AffiliationName": "Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS)"}, "57190878434": {"Name": "Braun S.", "AuthorID": "57190878434", "AffiliationID": "113126338", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB) GGmbH"}, "57190878575": {"Name": "H\u00e4nel H.", "AuthorID": "57190878575", "AffiliationID": "113126338", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB) GGmbH"}}}
