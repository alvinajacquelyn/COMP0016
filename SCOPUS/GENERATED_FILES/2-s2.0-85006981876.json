In this paper, the analysis of the one-tap normalized least-mean-square (LMS) carrier phase recovery (CPR) is carried out and the close-form expression is investigated for quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) coherent optical fiber communication systems, in compensating both laser phase noise and equalization enhanced phase noise. Numerical simulations have also been implemented to verify the theoretical analysis. It is found that the one-tap normalized least-mean-square algorithm gives the same analytical expression for predicting CPR bit-error-rate (BER) floors as the traditional differential carrier phase recovery, when both the laser phase noise and the equalization enhanced phase noise are taken into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carrier phase recovery", "Coherent optical detection", "Equalization enhanced phase noise", "Laser phase noise", "Normalized least-meansquare algorithm", "Optical fiber communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier phase recovery", "Coherent optical detection", "Equalization enhanced phase noise", "Laser phase noise", "Mean-square"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006981876", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin University"}, "7102705046": {"Name": "Jacobsen G.", "AuthorID": "7102705046", "AffiliationID": "60020793", "AffiliationName": "Acreo Swedish ICT AB"}, "7202624351": {"Name": "Popov S.", "AuthorID": "7202624351", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Royal Institute of Technology"}, "55720769200": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55720769200", "AffiliationID": "60020793", "AffiliationName": "Acreo Swedish ICT AB"}, "7405910538": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "7405910538", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin University"}, "55881854600": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55881854600", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin University"}}}
