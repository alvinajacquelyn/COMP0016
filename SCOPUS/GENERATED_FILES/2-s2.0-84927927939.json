Ophthalmologists who reported a case were sent an initial questionnaire, with a follow-up questionnaire after 6 months. We collected information on the demographics, complications, changes in visual acuity, and management. The 2011 National Census was used as a source for population and ethnicity in the UK.ResultsThere were 73 incident cases of acute corneal hydrops, with a response to the initial questionnaire for 64 (88%) patients and follow-up data at 6 months for 57 (78%) patients. For the 64 confirmed cases the median (interquartile range) age of onset was 31.9 (23.2, 41.3) years and 48 (75%) of the cases occurred in males. A total of 42 (66%) patients were white, 14 (22%) were South Asian, and 7 (11%) were black. The proportion of South Asian and black patients with acute corneal hydrops was significantly higher than in the general population (P<0.001). The minimum estimated annual incidence of acute corneal hydrops in patients with keratoconus was estimated to be 1.43 (1.10, 1.83) per 1000. At 6 months following acute corneal hydrops a decision to proceed with keratoplasty had been made for 12 (20.3%) patients.ConclusionsThis is the first population-based estimate of the incidence of acute corneal hydrops in keratoconus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Corneal Diseases", "Corneal Transplantation", "Disease Management", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Keratoconus", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927927939", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"15520956300": {"Name": "Barsam A.", "AuthorID": "15520956300", "AffiliationID": "60029855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital"}, "10142675000": {"Name": "Petrushkin H.", "AuthorID": "10142675000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Corneal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Corneal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8242134200": {"Name": "Xing W.", "AuthorID": "8242134200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Corneal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004454391": {"Name": "Tuft S.", "AuthorID": "7004454391", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Corneal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56478557400": {"Name": "Brennan N.", "AuthorID": "56478557400", "AffiliationID": "60015343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Hillingdon Hospital"}, "6603204154": {"Name": "Foot B.", "AuthorID": "6603204154", "AffiliationID": "60172683", "AffiliationName": "British Ophthalmic Surveillance Unit, Royal College of Ophthalmologists"}}}
