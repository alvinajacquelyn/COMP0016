Here, we investigated the requirement of regions in ATG2A for its organellar localization and function. The N-terminal amino acids 1\u2013198 and the C-terminal amino acids 1830\u20131938 are required for the localization to isolation membranes and lipid droplets, respectively. The C-terminal region is not required for the localization to isolation membranes and for autophagy. We also identified an amphipathic helix in ATG2A that is required for both its localization to organelles and autophagosome formation. These data suggest that the dual localization of ATG2A is regulated by different regions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amphipathic helix", "ATG2", "autophagy", "lipid droplet", "VPS13"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Autophagosomes", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Lipid Droplets", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Protein Domains", "Recombinant Proteins", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034236326", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57194191548": {"Name": "Tamura N.", "AuthorID": "57194191548", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University"}, "8674063400": {"Name": "Nishimura T.", "AuthorID": "8674063400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "8576576100": {"Name": "Koyama-Honda I.", "AuthorID": "8576576100", "AffiliationID": "60002354, 60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo"}, "7501428195": {"Name": "Yamamoto H.", "AuthorID": "7501428195", "AffiliationID": "60002354, 60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo"}, "7006933381": {"Name": "Mizushima N.", "AuthorID": "7006933381", "AffiliationID": "60002354, 60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo"}, "56061738300": {"Name": "Sakamaki Y.", "AuthorID": "56061738300", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Microscopy Research Support Unit Research Core, Tokyo Medical and Dental University"}}}
