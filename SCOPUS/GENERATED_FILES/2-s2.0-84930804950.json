Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are secreted inter-cellular signalling molecules, which are essential during development and are important in cancer, post-natal tissue homeostasis and repair. Hh signalling mediated by the Hh-responsive transcription factor Gli2 also has multiple roles in T-lymphocyte development and differentiation. Here, we investigate the function of Gli2 in T-cell signalling and activation. Gene transcription driven by the Gli2 transcriptional activator isoform (Gli2A) attenuated T-cell activation and proliferation following T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Expression of Gli2A in T-cells altered gene expression profiles, impaired the TCR-induced Ca2+ flux and nuclear expression of NFAT2, suppressed upregulation of molecules essential for activation, and attenuated signalling pathways upstream of the AP-1 and NF\u03baB complexes, leading to reduced activation of these important transcription factors. Inhibition of physiological Hh-dependent transcription increased NF\u03baB activity upon TCR ligation. These data are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of immunomodulation, particularly in tissues where Hh proteins or other Gli-activating ligands such as TGF\u00df are upregulated, including during inflammation, tissue damage and repair, and in tumour microenvironments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AP-1", "Gli2", "Hedgehog", "IL-2", "NF\u03baB", "T-cell", "TCR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "NF-kappa B", "NFATC Transcription Factors", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transcription Factor AP-1", "Transcriptional Activation", "Transcriptome", "Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930804950", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"14059911300": {"Name": "Furmanski A.", "AuthorID": "14059911300", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, University of Bedfordshire"}, "42560912500": {"Name": "Barbarulo A.", "AuthorID": "42560912500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56677505400": {"Name": "Solanki A.", "AuthorID": "56677505400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55221935000": {"Name": "Lau C.", "AuthorID": "55221935000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55620597400": {"Name": "Sahni H.", "AuthorID": "55620597400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "37040794300": {"Name": "Saldana J.", "AuthorID": "37040794300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "54790576500": {"Name": "Crompton T.", "AuthorID": "54790576500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6701351362": {"Name": "D'Acquisto F.", "AuthorID": "6701351362", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biochemical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, QMUL"}}}
