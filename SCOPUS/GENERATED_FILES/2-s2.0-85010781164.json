It was not until Stokes' (1851 Camb. Phil. Soc. 9 8-106) (whose interest was spurred by the pendulur time pieces of the mid 19th century) treatise on viscous flow that a theoretical framework for the drag on a sphere at low Reynolds number was laid down. Stokes' famous drag law has been used to determine two fundamental physical constants - the charge on an electron and Avogadro's constant - and has been used in theories which have won three Nobel prizes. Considering its illustrious history it is then not surprising that the flow past a sphere and its two-dimensional analog, the flow past a cylinder, form the starting point of teaching flow past a rigid body in undergraduate level fluid mechanics courses. Usually starting with the two-dimensional potential flow past a cylinder, students progress to the three-dimensional potential flow past a sphere. However, when the viscous flow past rigid bodies is taught, the three-dimensional example of a sphere is first introduced, and followed by (but not often), the two-dimensional viscous flow past a cylinder. The reason why viscous flow past a cylinder is generally not taught is because it is usually explained from an asymptotic analysis perspective. In fact, this added mathematical complexity is why the drag on a cylinder was only solved in 1911, 60 years after the drag on a sphere. In this note, we show that the viscous flow past a cylinder can be explained without the need to introduce any asymptotic analysis while still capturing all the physical insight of this classic fluid mechanics problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drag", "fluid mechanics", "low Re flows"], "IndexKeywords": ["Flow past a cylinder", "Fundamental physical constant", "low Re flows", "Low Reynolds number", "Mathematical complexity", "Theoretical framework", "Three dimensional potential flow", "Two dimensional potential flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010781164", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7006126106": {"Name": "Eames I.", "AuthorID": "7006126106", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35484365400": {"Name": "Klettner C.", "AuthorID": "35484365400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
