The method of choice to evaluate genome-wide methylation has been the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K), but it was recently replaced with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC). We therefore sought to validate the EPIC array in comparison to the 450K array for both fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumours. We also performed analysis on the EPIC array with paired FF and FFPE samples to adapt to a clinical setting where FFPE is routinely used. Further, we compared two restoration methods, REPLI-g and Infinium, for FFPE-derived DNA on the EPIC array. The Pearson correlation of \u03b2 values for common probes on the 450K and EPIC array was high for both FF (mean: 0.992) and FFPE (mean: 0.984) samples. The \u03b2 values generated from the EPIC array for FFPE samples correlated well with the paired FF tumours, but varied between 0.901 and 0.987. We did note that sample pairs with lower correlation had less bimodal density distributions of \u03b2 values and displayed higher noise in the copy number alteration plots (generated from the methylation array data) in the FFPE sample. Both REPLI-g and the Infinium restoration for FFPE samples performed well on the EPIC array and generated equivalent correlation scores to the paired FF sample.", "AuthorKeywords": ["450K", "Brain tumour", "DNA methylation", "DNA restoration", "EPIC", "Epigenetics", "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Neoplasms", "CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Humans", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Paraffin Embedding", "Tissue Fixation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016938751", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"39561119800": {"Name": "Kling T.", "AuthorID": "39561119800", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57193683276": {"Name": "Wenger A.", "AuthorID": "57193683276", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "35081819900": {"Name": "Car\u00e9n H.", "AuthorID": "35081819900", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
