Identifying the precise composition of these materials is essential, especially in the design of surface catalysts, where the surface concentration of the active component determines the activity of the material. Antimicrobial materials which utilize nanoparticles are a particular focus of this technology. Recently swell encapsulation has emerged as a technique for inserting antimicrobial nanoparticles into a host polymer matrix. Swell encapsulation provides the advantage of localizing the incorporation to the external surfaces of materials, which act as the active sites of these materials. However, quantification of this nanoparticle uptake is challenging. Previous studies explore the link between antimicrobial activity and surface concentration of the active component, but this is not directly visualized. Here we show a reliable method to monitor the incorporation of nanoparticles into a polymer host matrix via swell encapsulation. We show that the surface concentration of CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles can be accurately visualized through cross-sectional fluorescence imaging. Using this method, we can quantify the uptake of nanoparticles via swell encapsulation and measure the surface concentration of encapsulated particles, which is key in optimizing the activity of functional materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Engineering", "Fluorescence Imaging", "Fluorescent", "Functional Material", "Issue 113", "Nanocomposite", "Nanoparticle", "Physics", "Polydimethylsiloxane", "Quantum dots", "Swell Encapsulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Infective Agents", "Nanoparticles", "Optical Imaging", "Polymers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979894383", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"26028240500": {"Name": "Crick C.R.", "AuthorID": "26028240500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "36144012000": {"Name": "Ivanov A.P.", "AuthorID": "36144012000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7005079107": {"Name": "Edel J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005079107", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55659162000": {"Name": "Peveler W.J.", "AuthorID": "55659162000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.C.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
