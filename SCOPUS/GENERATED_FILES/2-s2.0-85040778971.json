Here we demonstrate the production of DNA-detonation nanodiamond (DNA-DND) conjugates with high dispersion and solubility using an ultrasonic, mixed-silanization chemistry protocol based on the in situ Bead-Assisted Sonication Disintegration (BASD) silanization method. We use two silanes to achieve these properties: (1) 3-(trihydroxysilyl)propyl methylphosphonate (THPMP); a negatively charged silane that imparts high zeta potential and solubility in solution; and (2) (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES); a commonly used functional silane that contributes an amino group for subsequent bioconjugation. We target these amino groups for covalent conjugation to thiolated, single-stranded DNA oligomers using the heterobifunctional crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Sulfo-SMCC). The resulting DNA-DND conjugates are the smallest reported to date, as determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The functionalisation method we describe is versatile and can be used to produce a wide variety of soluble DND-biomolecule conjugates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical Phenomena", "DNA", "Dynamic Light Scattering", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Nanodiamonds", "Silanes", "Solubility", "Sonication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040778971", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35975864500": {"Name": "Edgington R.", "AuthorID": "35975864500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "35113983700": {"Name": "Spillane K.M.", "AuthorID": "35113983700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London"}, "56326553400": {"Name": "Papageorgiou G.", "AuthorID": "56326553400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "57200320596": {"Name": "Wray W.", "AuthorID": "57200320596", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57200317233": {"Name": "Reid G.", "AuthorID": "57200317233", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "7201484787": {"Name": "Webb M.", "AuthorID": "7201484787", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "7102001633": {"Name": "Schaefer A.T.", "AuthorID": "7102001633", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55427113300": {"Name": "Ishiwata H.", "AuthorID": "55427113300", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University"}, "6504798002": {"Name": "Labarca M.", "AuthorID": "6504798002", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University"}, "6503870040": {"Name": "Leal-Ortiz S.", "AuthorID": "6503870040", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University"}, "6602692503": {"Name": "Melosh N.", "AuthorID": "6602692503", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University"}, "7006821897": {"Name": "Foord J.", "AuthorID": "7006821897", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
