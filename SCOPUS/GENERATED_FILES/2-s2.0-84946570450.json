The messages intended to the ID user is required to be kept confidential to the EH user. Our objective is to design the optimal transmit covariance matrix at the BS for maximizing the ergodic secrecy rate subject to the harvested energy requirement for the EH user exploiting only statistical channel state information at the BS. To this end, we begin by deriving an approximation for the ergodic secrecy rate using large-dimensional random matrix theory and the method of Taylor series expansion. This approximation enables us to derive the asymptotic-optimal transmit covariance matrix that achieves the tradeoff for ergodic secrecy rate and harvested energy. The simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of the approximation and show that a bigger rate-energy region can be achieved when the Rician factor increases or the path loss exponent decreases. We also show that when the transmit correlation increases or the distance between the eavesdropper and the BS decreases, the harvested energy will be increased, while the achieved ergodic secrecy rate decreases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy harvesting", "large dimensional random matrix theory", "MIMO wiretap channel", "SWIPT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Information and power transfers", "Information decoding", "Mimo wiretap channels", "Random matrix theory", "Statistical channel state informations", "SWIPT", "Taylor series expansions", "Transmit correlation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946570450", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55961790800": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55961790800", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "8882010600": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "8882010600", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "24473792300": {"Name": "Yuen C.", "AuthorID": "24473792300", "AffiliationID": "60104290", "AffiliationName": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}, "7201367144": {"Name": "Wen C.", "AuthorID": "7201367144", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
