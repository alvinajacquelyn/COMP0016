Although a significant number of T1DM patients have or will develop further autoimmune disorders during their lifetime, coexisting severe immunodysregulation is rare. Objective: Presuming autosomal-recessive inheritance in a complex immunodysregulation disorder including T1DM and short stature in two siblings, we performed whole-exome sequencing. Case Presentation: Two Libyan siblings born to consanguineous parents were presented to our diabetology department at ages 12 and 5 years, respectively. Apart from T1DM diagnosed at age 2 years, patient 1 suffered from chronic restrictive lung disease, mild enteropathy, hypogammaglobulinemia, and GH deficiency. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed B-cell deficiency. In addition, CD4\u03b2/CD25\u03b2 and CD25high/FoxP3\u03b2 cells were diminished, whereas an unusual CD25-/FoxP3\u03b2 population was detectable. The younger brother, patient 2, also developed T1DM during infancy. Although his enteropathy was more severe and electrolyte derangements repeatedly led to hospitalization, he did not have significant pulmonary problems. IgG levels and B-lymphocytes were within normal ranges. Results: By whole-exome sequencing we identified a homozygous truncating mutation (c.2445-2447del(C)3ins(C)2, p.P816Lfs\u22174) in the lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) gene in both siblings. The diagnosis of LRBA deficiency was confirmed by a fluorescenceactivated cell sorting-based immunoassay showing the absence of LRBA protein in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Conclusion: We identified a novel truncating LRBA mutation in two siblings with T1DM, short stature, and severe immunodysregulation. LRBA mutations have previously been reported to cause multiorgan autoimmunity and immunodysfunction. In light of the variable phenotypes reported so far in LRBA-mutant individuals, LRBA deficiency should be considered in all patients presenting withT1DMandsigns of severe immunodysregulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Body Height", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Female", "Growth Disorders", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960903848", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"22958836800": {"Name": "Schreiner F.", "AuthorID": "22958836800", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Endocrinology Division, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn"}, "57170703900": {"Name": "Plamper M.", "AuthorID": "57170703900", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Endocrinology Division, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn"}, "6603629554": {"Name": "Gohlke B.", "AuthorID": "6603629554", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Endocrinology Division, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn"}, "6602851509": {"Name": "Woelfle J.", "AuthorID": "6602851509", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Endocrinology Division, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn"}, "57170700000": {"Name": "Dueker G.", "AuthorID": "57170700000", "AffiliationID": "116449660", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology"}, "55314023000": {"Name": "Schoenberger S.", "AuthorID": "55314023000", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn"}, "36088833300": {"Name": "G\u00e1mez-D\u00edaz L.", "AuthorID": "36088833300", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg"}, "26643476400": {"Name": "Grimbacher B.", "AuthorID": "26643476400", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg"}, "51863754400": {"Name": "Hilger A.", "AuthorID": "51863754400", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Human Genetics, University of Bonn"}, "55600448500": {"Name": "Reutter H.", "AuthorID": "55600448500", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatology and Pediatric Intensive Care, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn"}}}
