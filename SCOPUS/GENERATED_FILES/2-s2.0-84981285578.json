KGaA, Weinheim.Novel and less toxic quantum dot (QD) semiconductors are desired for developing environmentally benign colloidal quantum dot solar cells. Here, the synthesis of novel lead/cadmium-free neodymium chalcogenide Nd2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs via solution-processed method is reported for the first time. The results show that small-bandgap semiconductor QDs with a narrow size distribution ranging from 2 to 8 nm can be produced, and the wide absorption band can be achieved by the redshift owing to the size quantization effect by controlling the initial loading of chalcogenide precursors. By analyzing the band structure of QDs and the energy level alignment between QDs and TiO2, the influence of energy offset between the conduction band edges of QDs and TiO2 on the charge transfer dynamics and photovoltaic performance of QD solar cells (QDSCs) is investigated. It is revealed that among the three types of QDs studied, Nd2Se3 QDSCs with the smallest energy offset exhibit the best performances and a decent power conversion efficiency of 3.19% is achieved. This work clearly demonstrates the promising potentials of novel rare earth chalcogenide quantum dots in photovoltaic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["charge transfer dynamics", "energy level alignment", "quantum dot solar cell", "rare-earth chalcogenide", "titanium dioxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge-transfer dynamics", "Energy level alignment", "Narrow size distributions", "Photovoltaic applications", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Quantum dot solar cells", "Rare earth chalcogenides", "Size-quantization effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981285578", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56157911800": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "56157911800", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57208453092": {"Name": "Jin X.", "AuthorID": "57208453092", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57190564909": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57190564909", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57190578808": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57190578808", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "56888047000": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "56888047000", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "56379266700": {"Name": "Cheng Y.", "AuthorID": "56379266700", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "8437549800": {"Name": "Qin Y.", "AuthorID": "8437549800", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "35082377300": {"Name": "Luo X.", "AuthorID": "35082377300", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "35272722000": {"Name": "Luo S.", "AuthorID": "35272722000", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "7202664495": {"Name": "Wei T.", "AuthorID": "7202664495", "AffiliationID": "60007954", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National Chung-Cheng University"}, "55600876400": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55600876400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering J07, University of Sydney"}}}
