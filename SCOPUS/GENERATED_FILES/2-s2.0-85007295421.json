Development of 3D, tissue-like culture systems offers much promise for boosting our understanding of human neural development, birth defects, neurodegenerative diseases and neural injury, and for providing platforms that will more accurately predict efficacy of putative therapeutic compounds and assess responses to potentially neurotoxic agents. Although novel technological developments and a more interdisciplinary approach to modeling the human CNS are accelerating the pace of discovery, increasing the complexity of in vitro systems increases the ordeals to be overcome to establish highly reproducible models amenable to quantitative analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CNS", "development", "disease", "human", "in vitro modeling", "stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Nervous System", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neurogenesis", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007295421", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"]], "AuthorData": {"40262607700": {"Name": "Vagaska B.", "AuthorID": "40262607700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35583510100": {"Name": "Ferretti P.", "AuthorID": "35583510100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
