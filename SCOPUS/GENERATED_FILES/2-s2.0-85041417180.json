This work presents a new genetic algorithm (GA) based optimisation approach for medium-term capacity planning of a multi-product, multi-suite biopharmaceutical facility using a continuous-time representation. The continuous-time model is implemented by utilising a dynamic chromosome structure capable of adapting to the problem by growing in length from a single gene corresponding to a production campaign in a manufacturing schedule. The proposed optimisation approach is validated on a previously published industrial case study solved with a continuous-time MILP formulation. The results indicate that the proposed approach is both robust and fast at solving a medium-term scheduling problem from biopharmaceutical industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biopharmaceutical", "capacity planning", "continuous-time", "genetic algorithms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041417180", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57200500910": {"Name": "Jankauskas K.", "AuthorID": "57200500910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005343335": {"Name": "Farid S.S.", "AuthorID": "7005343335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
