However, it is typically assumed that customers are fully rational decision-makers and maximize their utility perfectly. Recently, modeling customer bounded rationality has been gaining increasing attention and interest. This paper summarizes various approaches of modeling customer bounded rationality, surveys how they are applied to relevant operations management settings, and presents the new insights obtained. We also suggest future research opportunities in this important area.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral operations", "Bounded rationality", "Customer behavior", "Operations management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavioral operations", "Bounded rationality", "Customer behavior", "Decision makers", "Operations management", "Research opportunities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033454897", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"57220986871": {"Name": "Ren H.", "AuthorID": "57220986871", "AffiliationID": "60176025", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management"}, "55702206900": {"Name": "Huang T.", "AuthorID": "55702206900", "AffiliationID": "60138810, 60031117", "AffiliationName": "Carroll School of Management"}}}
