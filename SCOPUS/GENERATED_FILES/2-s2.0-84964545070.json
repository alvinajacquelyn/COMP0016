Traditional methods for determining the volumetric wear on acetabular cups require reference surface from a pre-worn model, which is not feasible for clinical retrieved implants. In this study, a methodology based on co-ordinate measuring machine (CMM) measurement is proposed to reconstruct the reference surface by applying a mathematical model on those selected unworn regions of the acetabular liners. For validation purposes, three polyethylene liners from 5-million-cycle hip simulator testing were employed, whose wear volume at different measurement points was determined by applying the developed method and the results were compared to those determined via traditional approaches. Volumetric loss estimated by the developed method was found to correlate well with the results estimated by the traditional methods (R2=0.9949). Moreover, two surgically retrieved inserts were analyzed using the developed methodology. The wear volume estimated from the two retrieved liners was also found to agree well with the observation from X-ray photograph. Results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in determining the volumetric wear for retrieved components providing viable unworn regions on the liner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["creep", "failure analyses", "hip prostheses", "measurement/assessment", "Wear"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetabular liners", "Hip replacements", "Measurement points", "Polyethylene liner", "Retrieved implant", "Traditional approaches", "Volumetric wear", "X ray photograph"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964545070", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57034587600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57034587600", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an"}, "56345954000": {"Name": "Peng X.", "AuthorID": "56345954000", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an"}, "56688847300": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "56688847300", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an"}, "35787219200": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "35787219200", "AffiliationID": "60089930, 60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an"}, "7403625753": {"Name": "Jin Z.", "AuthorID": "7403625753", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "56262533700": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "56262533700", "AffiliationID": "60069708, 60088187", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University Xi'an"}, "7405690138": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "7405690138", "AffiliationID": "60069708, 60088187", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University Xi'an"}, "57185637300": {"Name": "Mihcin S.", "AuthorID": "57185637300", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "John Scale Centre for Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
