Cod C4-like protein was isolated from plasma, specific antibodies generated and C4-like protein was assessed in cod sera, mucus and in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum and mucus. Higher levels of C4-like protein were detected in serum- than mucus-derived EVs. Post-translational deimination, caused by conversion of arginine into citrulline, can affect protein structure and function. Here we detected deiminated forms of C4-like protein in cod serum and at lower levels in mucus. C4-like protein was also found in deiminated form at low levels in EVs from both serum and mucus. C4-like protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry in cod larvae and detected in a range of organs including in liver, kidney, gut, muscle, skin and mucus, as well as in neuronal tissues of the brain, spinal cord and eye. This abundance of C4-like protein during early development may indicate roles in tissue remodelling, in addition to immune defences. The presence of deiminated C4-like protein in serum and mucosa, as well as in EVs, may suggest C4 protein moonlighting via post-translational deimination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cod (Gadus morhua L.)", "Complement C4", "Extracellular vesicles (EVs)", "Ontogeny", "Protein deimination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Complement C4", "Deamination", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Fish Proteins", "Gadus morhua", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068551467", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"7202237069": {"Name": "Lange S.", "AuthorID": "7202237069", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Architecture and Regeneration Research Group, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "8775592800": {"Name": "Kraev I.", "AuthorID": "8775592800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "56508286200": {"Name": "Magnad\u00f3ttir B.", "AuthorID": "56508286200", "AffiliationID": "60071113", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Experimental Pathology, University of Iceland"}, "7005260746": {"Name": "Dodds A.W.", "AuthorID": "7005260746", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60016998", "AffiliationName": "MRC Immunochemistry Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
