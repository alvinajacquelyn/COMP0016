Case presentation: A 33-year-old, previously healthy, white male office worker was stretching his neck when he developed sudden left-sided visual loss lasting 5 minutes associated with headache. He had no other neurological symptoms or signs. He was investigated with a computed tomography angiogram, which revealed a left vertebral artery dissection with a right posterior cerebral artery vascular occlusion. Conclusions: We describe an atypical case of vertebral artery dissection presenting with sudden transient visual disturbance without neurological signs in an otherwise healthy man. This is a rare but potentially fatal condition that can result in thromboembolic infarction. A high index of suspicion is crucial to make an early diagnosis and avoid devastating neurological outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Stroke", "Transient visual loss", "Vertebral artery dissection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebral Angiography", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Headache", "Humans", "Infarction, Posterior Cerebral Artery", "Male", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vertebral Artery Dissection", "Vision Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966389460", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56986205300": {"Name": "Yvon C.", "AuthorID": "56986205300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "24512755200": {"Name": "Ramsden C.", "AuthorID": "24512755200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57217404398": {"Name": "Adams A.", "AuthorID": "57217404398", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University"}, "55311626700": {"Name": "McLauchlan D.", "AuthorID": "55311626700", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
