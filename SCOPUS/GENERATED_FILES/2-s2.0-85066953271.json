Here we investigate the causative mechanisms and find reciprocal dysregulation of epithelial genes, cell junction components and actomyosin properties in Grhl2 null and over-expressing embryos. Grhl2 null surface ectoderm shows a shift from epithelial to neuroepithelial identity (with ectopic expression of N-cadherin and Sox2), actomyosin disorganisation, cell shape changes and diminished resistance to neural fold recoil upon ablation of the closure point. In contrast, excessive abundance of Grhl2 generates a super-epithelial surface ectoderm, in which up-regulation of cell-cell junction proteins is associated with an actomyosin-dependent increase in local mechanical stress. This is compatible with apposition of the neural folds but not with progression of closure, unless myosin activity is inhibited. Overall, our findings suggest that Grhl2 plays a crucial role in regulating biomechanical properties of the surface ectoderm that are essential for spinal neurulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actomyosin", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cadherins", "Ectoderm", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Epithelial Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Intercellular Junctions", "Mice", "Neural Tube", "Neuroepithelial Cells", "Neurulation", "SOXB1 Transcription Factors", "Stress, Mechanical", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066953271", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36167171100": {"Name": "Nikolopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "36167171100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56574858100": {"Name": "Hirst C.S.", "AuthorID": "56574858100", "AffiliationID": "109941443", "AffiliationName": "Horizon Discovery"}, "37026041900": {"Name": "Galea G.", "AuthorID": "37026041900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6603183187": {"Name": "Moulding D.", "AuthorID": "6603183187", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57205097024": {"Name": "Marshall A.R.", "AuthorID": "57205097024", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "24725761200": {"Name": "Rolo A.", "AuthorID": "24725761200", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida Professor Egas Moniz"}, "16303182000": {"Name": "De Castro S.C.P.", "AuthorID": "16303182000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57209239199": {"Name": "D.E.
