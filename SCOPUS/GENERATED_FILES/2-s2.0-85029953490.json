There is no tool to assess the effectiveness of the programme in communicating CVD risk to patients. Aims The aim of this paper was to develop a questionnaire examining patients' CVD risk awareness for use in health service research evaluations of the NHS Health Check programme. Methods We developed an 85-item questionnaire to determine patients' views of their risk of CVD. The questionnaire was based on a review of the relevant literature. After review by an expert panel and focus group discussion, 22 items were dropped and 2 new items were added. The resulting 65-item questionnaire with satisfactory content validity (content validity indices\u22650.80) and face validity was tested on 110 NHS Health Check attendees in primary care in a cross-sectional study between 21 May 2014 and 28 July 2014. Results Following analyses of data, we reduced the questionnaire from 65 to 26 items. The 26-item questionnaire constitutes four scales: Knowledge of CVD Risk and Prevention, Perceived Risk of Heart Attack/Stroke, Perceived Benefits and Intention to Change Behaviour and Healthy Eating Intentions. Perceived Risk (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.85) and Perceived Benefits and Intention to Change Behaviour (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.82) have satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1\u22650.70). Healthy Eating Intentions (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.56) is below minimum threshold for reliability but acceptable for a three-item scale. Conclusions The resulting questionnaire, with satisfactory reliability and validity, may be used in assessing patients' awareness of CVD risk among NHS Health Check attendees.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular disease", "primary prevention", "questionnaire", "risk assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Program Evaluation", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "State Medicine", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029953490", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56716252900": {"Name": "Woringer M.", "AuthorID": "56716252900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "7102027801": {"Name": "Majeed A.", "AuthorID": "7102027801", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "57202841728": {"Name": "Soljak M.", "AuthorID": "57202841728", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "55762647200": {"Name": "Nielsen J.J.", "AuthorID": "55762647200", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, City University London"}, "25936981900": {"Name": "Zibarras L.", "AuthorID": "25936981900", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, City University London"}, "57195408064": {"Name": "Evason J.", "AuthorID": "57195408064", "AffiliationID": "119103508", "AffiliationName": "Health Diagnostics Ltd"}, "56310663400": {"Name": "Kassianos A.P.", "AuthorID": "56310663400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "35188745700": {"Name": "Harris M.", "AuthorID": "35188745700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}}}
