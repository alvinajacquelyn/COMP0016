Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.A quadruplex sequence from the promoter region of the c-KIT gene forms a stable quadruplex, as characterized by crystallographic and NMR methods. Two new crystal structures are reported here, together with molecular dynamics simulation studies on these quadruplex crystal structures and an NMR structure. The new crystal structures, each in a distinct space group and lattice packing arrangement, together with the existing structures, demonstrate that the c-KIT quadruplex fold does not change with differing environments, suggesting that quadruplex topological dynamism is not a general phenomenon. The single and dinucleotide loops in these structures show a high degree of conformational flexibility within the three crystal forms and the NMR ensemble, with no evidence of clustering to particular conformers. This is in accord with the findings of high loop flexibility from the molecular dynamics studies. It is suggested that intramolecular quadruplexes can be grouped into two broad classes (i) those with at least one single-nucleotide loop, often showing singular topologies even though loops are highly flexible, and (ii) with all loops comprising at least two nucleotides, leading to topological dynamism. The loops can have more stable and less dynamic base-stacked secondary structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["G-Quadruplexes", "Models, Molecular", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941098987", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55595465400": {"Name": "Wei D.", "AuthorID": "55595465400", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Umea University"}, "55229685000": {"Name": "Husby J.", "AuthorID": "55229685000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
