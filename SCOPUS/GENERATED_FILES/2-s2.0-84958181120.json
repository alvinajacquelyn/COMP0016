However, the effect of cannabis potency on brain morphology has never been explored. Here, we investigated whether cannabis potency and pattern of use are associated with changes in corpus callosum (CC) microstructural organization, in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and individuals without psychosis, cannabis users and non-users. Method The CC of 56 FEP (37 cannabis users) and 43 individuals without psychosis (22 cannabis users) was virtually dissected and segmented using diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The diffusion index of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity was calculated for each segment. Results Across the whole sample, users of high-potency cannabis had higher total CC MD and higher total CC AD than both low-potency users and those who never used (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). Daily users also had higher total CC MD and higher total CC AD than both occasional users and those who never used (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, there was no effect of group (patient/individuals without psychosis) or group x potency interaction for either potency or frequency of use. The within-group analysis showed in fact that the effects of potency and frequency were similar in FEP users and in users without psychosis. Conclusions Frequent use of high-potency cannabis is associated with disturbed callosal microstructural organization in individuals with and without psychosis. Since high-potency preparations are now replacing traditional herbal drugs in many European countries, raising awareness about the risks of high-potency cannabis is crucial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cannabis", "corpus callosum", "first-episode psychosis", "tractography", "white matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affective Disorders, Psychotic", "Anisotropy", "Cannabis", "Case-Control Studies", "Comorbidity", "Corpus Callosum", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Marijuana Smoking", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958181120", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24376933400": {"Name": "Rigucci S.", "AuthorID": "24376933400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004181693": {"Name": "Girardi P.", "AuthorID": "7004181693", "AffiliationID": "60084996, 60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Sensory Organs, Sapienza University of Rome, Sant'Andrea Hospital"}, "54785084900": {"Name": "Marques T.R.", "AuthorID": "54785084900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "10738849300": {"Name": "Di Forti M.", "AuthorID": "10738849300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55619307929": {"Name": "Taylor H.", "AuthorID": "55619307929", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "6701566263": {"Name": "Bonaccorso S.", "AuthorID": "6701566263", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "6602196376": {"Name": "Dazzan P.", "AuthorID": "6602196376", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "24757840500": {"Name": "Dell'Acqua F.", "AuthorID": "24757840500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7101619950": {"Name": "Simmons A.", "AuthorID": "7101619950", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "15073211100": {"Name": "Mondelli V.", "AuthorID": "15073211100", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "7003615668": {"Name": "Pariante C.M.", "AuthorID": "7003615668", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}}}
