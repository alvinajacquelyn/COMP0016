While it is perhaps possible to run N-body or hydrodynamical simulations to determine the impact of these effects this approach is computationally expensive; especially to test a large number of theories of gravity. Instead we propose directly removing sensitivity to small-scale structure from the lensing spectrum, creating a statistic that is robust to these uncertainties. We do this by taking a redshift-dependent \u2113-cut after applying the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme. This reorganizes the information in the lensing spectrum to make the relationship between the angular scale, \u2113, and the structure scale, k, much clearer compared to standard cosmic shear power spectra - for which no direct relationship exists. We quantify the effectiveness of this method at removing sensitivity to small scales and compute the predicted Fisher error on the dark energy equation of state, w0, for different k-cuts in the matter power spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056157533", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57201992390": {"Name": "Taylor P.L.", "AuthorID": "57201992390", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "8899520500": {"Name": "Kitching T.D.", "AuthorID": "8899520500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "7003804366": {"Name": "Bernardeau F.", "AuthorID": "7003804366", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60106131, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "CEA - CNRS, URA 2306, Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique"}}}
