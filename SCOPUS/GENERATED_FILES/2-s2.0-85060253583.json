FEBS Letters published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.During calcium-regulated exocytosis, the constitutive fusion machinery is \u2018clamped\u2019 in a partially assembled state until synchronously released by calcium. The protein machinery involved in this process is known, but the supra-molecular architecture and underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography analysis in nerve growth factor-differentiated neuro-endocrine (PC12) cells to delineate the organization of the release machinery under the docked vesicles. We find that exactly six exocytosis modules, each likely consisting of a single SNAREpin with its bound Synaptotagmins, Complexin, and Munc18 proteins, are symmetrically arranged at the vesicle\u2013PM interface. Mutational analysis suggests that the symmetrical organization is templated by circular oligomers of Synaptotagmin. The observed arrangement, including its precise radial positioning, is in-line with the recently proposed \u2018buttressed ring hypothesis\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryo-electron tomography", "PC12 cells", "regulated exocytosis", "SNARE proteins", "synaptotagmin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Electron Microscope Tomography", "Exocytosis", "Munc18 Proteins", "Mutation", "Nerve Growth Factor", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurites", "PC12 Cells", "Rats", "SNARE Proteins", "Synaptic Vesicles", "Synaptotagmins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060253583", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57205486782": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57205486782", "AffiliationID": "60021783", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nautical Medicine, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University"}, "55070579700": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "55070579700", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "56157093800": {"Name": "Radhakrishnan A.", "AuthorID": "56157093800", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "56123598400": {"Name": "Grushin K.", "AuthorID": "56123598400", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "56155257600": {"Name": "Kasula R.", "AuthorID": "56155257600", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "57215805114": {"Name": "Chaudhuri A.", "AuthorID": "57215805114", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "54402730800": {"Name": "Gomathinayagam S.", "AuthorID": "54402730800", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "16245253100": {"Name": "Krishnakumar S.S.", "AuthorID": "16245253100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7103209478": {"Name": "Rothman J.E.", "AuthorID": "7103209478", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
