MRI can depict focal and diffuse manifestations of the disease, and accurately measure progression over time. The precise pathogenesis of MS is unknown. Nevertheless, genetic influences have been found for susceptibility to MS in linkage and association studies. More recent genome-wide association studies have revealed other genes to be related to disease susceptibility and severity, explaining part of the variability in symptoms, radiological manifestations and disease course. Studies relating genetics and imaging in MS are discussed in this paper.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetics", "Imaging", "MR imaging", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diagnostic Imaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926165123", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"20735253000": {"Name": "Roosendaal S.", "AuthorID": "20735253000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}}}
