Those grammars can alternatively be viewed as an extension of communication-free Petri nets. Our main results are that reachability and coverability are inter-reducible and both NP-complete. In particular, this class of commutative grammars enjoys semi-linear reachability sets. We also show that the inclusion problem is, in general, coNEXP-complete and already \u03a02 P-complete for grammars with only one non-terminal symbol. Showing the lower bound for the latter result requires us to develop a novel \u03a02 P-complete variant of the classic subset sum problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communication-free Petri nets", "Context-free commutative grammars", "Presburger arithmetic", "Reset nets", "Subset sum", "Vector addition systems with states"], "IndexKeywords": ["Context-free", "Presburger arithmetic", "Reset nets", "Subset sum", "Vector addition systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977074382", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35799547500": {"Name": "Chistikov D.", "AuthorID": "35799547500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Sponsored in part by the ERC Synergy award ImPACT.
