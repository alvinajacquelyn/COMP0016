Whether heightened cortisol stress reactivity is also present in this group has yet to be clearly demonstrated. We tested whether postnatal maternal depression predicts subsequent increases in offspring biological sensitivity to social stress, as indexed by elevated cortisol reactivity.Participants (mean age 22.4-years) derived from a 22-year prospective longitudinal study of the offspring of mothers who had postnatal depression (PND group; n= 38) and a control group (n = 38). Salivary cortisol response to a social-evaluative threat (Trier Social Stress Test) was measured.Hierarchical linear modelling indicated that PND group offspring showed greater cortisol reactivity to the stress test than control group participants. Group differences were not explained by offspring depressive or anxiety symptoms, experiences of negative life events, elevated basal cortisol at age 13-years, subsequent exposure to maternal depression, or other key covariates.The findings indicate that the presence of early maternal depression can predict offspring biological sensitivity to social stress in adulthood, with potential implications for broader functioning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortisol", "Depression", "Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis", "Longitudinal", "Maternal depression", "Stress sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Depression, Postpartum", "Disease Susceptibility", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mothers", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922665165", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55790235900": {"Name": "Barry T.J.", "AuthorID": "55790235900", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Psychology of Learning and Experimental Psychopathology, University of Leuven"}, "7202252529": {"Name": "Murray L.", "AuthorID": "7202252529", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "7402087714": {"Name": "Cooper P.", "AuthorID": "7402087714", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon R.M.P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "26039358500": {"Name": "Moutsiana C.", "AuthorID": "26039358500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Cambridge University"}, "57203060260": {"Name": "Herbert J.", "AuthorID": "57203060260", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Cambridge University"}, "7006081489": {"Name": "Halligan S.L.", "AuthorID": "7006081489", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}}}
