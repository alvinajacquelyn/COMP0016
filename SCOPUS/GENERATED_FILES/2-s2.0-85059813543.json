The crux of the proposed method lies in a new modelling of the matter density field in the Universe as a mixture of two components: a) a sparsity-based component that captures the non-Gaussian structure of the field, such as peaks or halos at different spatial scales; and b) a Gaussian random field, which is known to well represent the linear component of the field. This new model represents the distribution of matter in the universe much better than previously proposed models. We have developed a new algorithm that also takes into account the experimental problems we meet in practice, such as a non-diagonal covariance matrix of the noise or missing data. Experimental results on simulated data show that the proposed method exhibits improved estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental problems", "Gaussian random fields", "Linear components", "Matter density", "Spatial scale", "State-of-the-art methods", "Two-component", "Weak gravitational lensing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059813543", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"54785515800": {"Name": "Themelis K.", "AuthorID": "54785515800", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106133, 60121493, 60008134, 60007816, 60106184", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire AIM, UMR CEA-CNRS-Paris, Irfu DAp, CEA Saclay"}, "55194301800": {"Name": "Peel A.", "AuthorID": "55194301800", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106133, 60121493, 60008134, 60007816, 60106184", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire AIM, UMR CEA-CNRS-Paris, Irfu DAp, CEA Saclay"}, "7005106453": {"Name": "Starck J.", "AuthorID": "7005106453", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106133, 60121493, 60008134, 60007816, 60106184", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire AIM, UMR CEA-CNRS-Paris, Irfu DAp, CEA Saclay"}, "55173884500": {"Name": "Lanusse F.", "AuthorID": "55173884500", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57205376313": {"Name": "Jeffrey N.", "AuthorID": "57205376313", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
