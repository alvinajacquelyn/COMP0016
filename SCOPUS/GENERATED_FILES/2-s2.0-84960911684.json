We present a new prognostic model of 10-year coronary mortality in patients presenting for the first time with suspected angina to complement the Diamond-Forrester diagnostic model of disease probability. Methods and results A multicentre cohort of 8762 patients with suspected angina was followed up for a median of 10 years during which 233 coronary deaths were observed. Developmental (n=4412) and validation (n=4350) prognostic models based on clinical data available at first presentation showed good performance with close agreement and the final model utilised all 8762 patients to maximise power. The prognostic model showed strong associations with coronary mortality for age, sex, chest pain typicality, smoking status, diabetes, pulse rate, and ECG findings. Model discrimination was good (C statistic 0.83), patients in the highest risk quarter accounting for 173 coronary deaths (10-year risk of death: 8.7%) compared with a total of 60 deaths in the three lower risk quarters. When the model was simplified to incorporate only Diamond-Forrester factors (age, sex and character of symptoms) it underestimated coronary mortality risk, particularly in patients with reversible risk factors. Conclusions For the first time in patients with suspected angina, a prognostic model is presented based on simple clinical factors available at the initial cardiological assessment. The model discriminated powerfully between patients at high risk and lower risk of coronary death during 10-year follow-up. Clinical utility was reflected in the prognostic value it added to the updated Diamond-Forrester diagnostic model of disease probability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angina Pectoris", "Cause of Death", "Comorbidity", "Coronary Disease", "Decision Support Techniques", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outpatient Clinics, Hospital", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Smoking", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960911684", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6602338209": {"Name": "Sekhri N.", "AuthorID": "6602338209", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre"}, "14631128400": {"Name": "Perel P.", "AuthorID": "14631128400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "26322352300": {"Name": "Clayton T.", "AuthorID": "26322352300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55749172200": {"Name": "Feder G.S.", "AuthorID": "55749172200", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Bart's Heart Centre"}}}
