This phase, one of the most important and challenging current problems in cosmology, represents a new imbalance in the governing gravitational equations. Historically, physics has addressed such imbalances by either identifying sources that were previously unaccounted for or by altering the gravitational theory. Several candidates, responsible for this expansion, have been proposed in the literature, in particular dark energy models and modified gravity models, amongst others. Outstanding questions are related to the nature of this so-called \u201cdark energy\u201d that is driving this acceleration, and whether it is due to the vacuum energy or a dynamical field. On the other hand, the late-time cosmic acceleration may be due to modifications of general relativity. In this work, we explore a generalised modified gravity theory, namely f(R, \u03c6, X) gravity, where R is the Ricci scalar, \u03c6 is a scalar field and X is a kinetic term. This theory contains a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models. We considered specific models and applications to the late-time cosmic acceleration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology", "Dark energy", "Modified gravity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970012799", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Institute of Origins, University College London"}, "56247935800": {"Name": "Bohmer C.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Institute of Origins, University College London"}, "7007134803": {"Name": "Lobo F.", "AuthorID": "7007134803", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrofisica e Ciencias do Espaco, Faculdade de Ciencias, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "24281967900": {"Name": "Saez-Gomez D.", "AuthorID": "24281967900", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrofisica e Ciencias do Espaco, Faculdade de Ciencias, Universidade de Lisboa"}}}
