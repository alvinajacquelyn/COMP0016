We investigated the relevance of the lectin complement pathway in CVID patients by analysing ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 serum levels and genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FCN2 and FCN3 genes. Our results show that ficolin-2 levels in CVID patients are significantly lower (P<0\u00b70001) than in controls. The lowest ficolin-2 levels are found in CVID patients with bronchiectasis (P=0\u00b70004) and autoimmunity (P=0\u00b704). Although serum levels of ficolin-3 were similar in CVID patients and controls, CVID patients with bronchiectasis again showed lower levels when compared to controls (P=0\u00b70001). Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the FCN2 gene confirmed known influences on ficolin-2 serum levels, but did not support a genetic basis for the observed ficolin-2 deficiency in CVID. We found that CVID patients with bronchiectasis have very low levels of ficolin-2. The reason for the deficiency of ficolin-2 in CVID and any possible causal relationship is currently unknown. However, as bronchiectasis is a very important factor for morbidity and mortality in CVID, ficolin-2 could also serve as biomarker for monitoring disease complications such as bronchiectasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complement", "CVID", "Ficolin-2", "Ficolin-3", "Lectin pathway"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Bronchiectasis", "Cohort Studies", "Common Variable Immunodeficiency", "Female", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "Lectins", "Male", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920264489", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57196699926": {"Name": "Metzger M.L.", "AuthorID": "57196699926", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), University Medical Centre Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "55631522300": {"Name": "Michelfelder I.", "AuthorID": "55631522300", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), University Medical Centre Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "23392828900": {"Name": "Goldacker S.", "AuthorID": "23392828900", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), University Medical Centre Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "22985579800": {"Name": "Melkaoui K.", "AuthorID": "22985579800", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), University Medical Centre Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "26643476400": {"Name": "Grimbacher B.", "AuthorID": "26643476400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology and Molecular Pathology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "6602460076": {"Name": "Salzer U.", "AuthorID": "6602460076", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Centre Freiburg"}, "15822418000": {"Name": "Litzman J.", "AuthorID": "15822418000", "AffiliationID": "60029543, 60116181", "AffiliationName": "Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University"}, "57090091100": {"Name": "Guzman D.", "AuthorID": "57090091100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology and Molecular Pathology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}}}
