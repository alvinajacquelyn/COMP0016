All rights reserved.IMPORTANCE Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be associated with uveitis. The reported prevalence of SLE in patients with uveitis varies from 0.1% to 4.8%. Accordingly, the positive predictive value of antinuclear antibody testing in diagnosing SLE in a patient with uveitis varies enormously. An accurate estimate of SLE prevalence in uveitis is needed to establish the value of routine antinuclear antibody testing in patients with uveitis. OBSERVATIONS A literature review using the Medline database was performed to find studies reporting data on uveitis etiology from January 1, 1984, to March 20, 2015. Studies were included where there were sufficient data to draw conclusions on the prevalence of SLE as an etiological factor in uveitis. Data for 53 315 patients were reviewed and 63 studies from 30 countries were included. The prevalence of SLE as a cause of uveitis was estimated to be 0.47%(95%CI, 0.41%-0.53%). The positive predictive value of routine antinuclear antibody testing was 2.9% (95%CI, 2.65%-3.19%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Systemic lupus erythematosus is a rare cause of uveitis. Routine antinuclear antibody testing has a low positive predictive value for SLE. These data suggest such testing should be reserved for patients where there is a higher pretest probability of SLE.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Antinuclear", "False Positive Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prevalence", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943642922", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56818585400": {"Name": "Gallagher K.", "AuthorID": "56818585400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Undergraduate Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital National Health Society Foundation Trust"}, "56896867300": {"Name": "Viswanathan A.", "AuthorID": "56896867300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6603695884": {"Name": "Okhravi N.", "AuthorID": "6603695884", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
