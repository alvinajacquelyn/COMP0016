We report on suspected drugs and the eye conditions found in a national study of incidence of diagnosis of visual impairment due to suspected ADR. Case ascertainment was via the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (BOSU), between March 2010 and February 2012, with follow-up after 6 months. Case definition: any child or adult with bilateral or unilateral visual impairment due to a suspected ADR, using distance acuity worse than Snellen 6/18 (logMAR 0.48) in the better eye (bilateral) or affected eye (unilateral). Anonymized patient information on potential cases was provided by managing ophthalmologists, comprising visual status before and after suspected ADR, ophthalmic condition attributable to the ADR, preexisting eye disease and prescribed medications at the time of the ADR. Permanency and causality of the visual impairment were confirmed by the managing clinician, after 6 months, using the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Committee criteria. Over 2 years, 36 eligible cases were reported of whom 23 had permanent VI. While most cases were due to drugs known to have adverse side-effects, some were unanticipated sporadic cases. Visual impairment due to ADRs is rare. However, with for example, increasing polypharmacy in the elderly, monitoring of ocular ADRs, although challenging, is necessary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active surveillance", "Adverse drug reactions", "Ocular", "Pharmacoepidemiology", "Visual impairment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979084710", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"57211811127": {"Name": "Cumberland P.M.", "AuthorID": "57211811127", "AffiliationID": "107151049", "AffiliationName": "Ulverscroft Vision Research Group"}, "57191956020": {"Name": "Rahi J.S.", "AuthorID": "57191956020", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003660346": {"Name": "Russell-Eggitt I.", "AuthorID": "7003660346", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
