Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting: The orthodontic department at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Material and methods: The study models of a sample of 100 orthodontic/orthognathic patients who were treated at the Eastman Dental Hospital were measured using the PAR index and ICON at three stages: pre-treatment, pre-surgery and at debond. Treatment need was assessed by measuring IOTN and IOFTN using start study models. Results: 99% of the sample showed an improvement in PAR score, with 82% of the sample being greatly improved. ICON showed that 95% of the sample had an improvement of different degrees with 5% being not improved or worse. The IOFTN qualified 97% of the patients for orthognathic treatment when used retrospectively on the sample while the DHC of IOTN qualified the whole sample for orthodontic treatment. Conclusions: Orthodontic/orthognathic treatment showed improved and acceptable overall results. The PAR index and ICON were valid measures to investigate the outcome of orthognathic treatment. IOFTN proved to be a useful tool in determining and prioritizing orthognathic treatment based purely on functional need.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ICON", "IOFTN", "IOTN", "Occlusal indices", "orthognathic surgery", "PAR", "treatment outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dental Occlusion", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Malocclusion", "Orthodontics, Corrective", "Orthognathic Surgical Procedures", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991506036", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthodontics", "DENT", "3505"]], "AuthorData": {"57209015526": {"Name": "Almutairi F.L.", "AuthorID": "57209015526", "AffiliationID": "110049517", "AffiliationName": "Jaber Alahmad Armed Forces Hospital"}, "35378926500": {"Name": "Hunt N.P.", "AuthorID": "35378926500", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "19634983000": {"Name": "Hodges S.J.", "AuthorID": "19634983000", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals"}}}
