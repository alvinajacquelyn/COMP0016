Drawing on this data, we highlight common themes of taking deals at \u2018face value\u2019, being the lawyer-technician who uses the law to effect his client\u2019s wishes, and not \u2018pushing\u2019 ethics. We suggest that there is an apathy - a lack of concern or interest - about ethics on the part of corporate lawyers. This apathy stems from various sources. It is linked to assumptions about the sorts of clients that large law firms are willing or not willing to act for, and assumptions about the \u2018right sort of people\u2019 the firm hires and retains; it is linked to strong notions of role morality; and it is founded on the classic legal ethics \u2018standard conception\u2019 principles of neutrality and non-accountability. Our data also highlights a lack of ethical infrastructures in large firms, and a lack of ethical leadership from law firm partners for the associates and trainees working for them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apathy", "Corporate lawyers", "Ethical infrastructure", "Large law firms", "Neutrality", "Nonaccountability", "Regulation", "Standard conception"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042300148", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"24345563600": {"Name": "Vaughan S.", "AuthorID": "24345563600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Law School, University of Birmingham"}, "57200720746": {"Name": "Oakley E.", "AuthorID": "57200720746", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Law School, University of Birmingham"}}}
