A set of 65 compounds with a broad range of structural diversity (in terms of volume, hydrogen-bonding, polarity and electrostatic force) were selected for this purpose. The Abraham linear free energy relationship (LFER) analyses of the retention factors on the immobilized HSA (human serum albumin) and AGP (\u03b11-acid glycoprotein) stationary phases showed that McGowan's characteristic molecular volume (V), dipolarity/polarizability (S) and hydrogen bond basicity (B) are the three significant molecular descriptors of solutes determining the interaction with immobilized plasma proteins, whereas excess molar refraction (E) is less important and hydrogen bond acidity (A) is not of statistical significance in both systems, for electrically neutral compounds. It was shown that ionised acids, as carboxylate anions, bind very strongly to the immobilized HSA stationary phase and that ionised bases, as cations bind strongly to the AGP stationary phase. This is the first time that the effect of ionised species on plasma protein binding has been determined quantitatively; the increased binding of acids to HSA is due almost entirely to acids in their ionised form.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham (Absolv) descriptors", "Binding", "HPLC", "Linear free energy relationship", "Plasma proteins", "Retention factors (k)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anions", "Cations", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Models, Chemical", "Orosomucoid", "Pharmacokinetics", "Protein Binding", "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship", "Serum Albumin, Human"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032966324", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57196423442": {"Name": "Kamble S.", "AuthorID": "57196423442", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford"}, "6701837431": {"Name": "Loadman P.", "AuthorID": "6701837431", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford"}, "8626568900": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "8626568900", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
