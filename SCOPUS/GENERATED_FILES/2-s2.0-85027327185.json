Few studies have investigated the viral determinants of mother-to-child transmission. To determine the impact of Gag-proteasedriven viral replication capacity on mother-to-child transmission, the replication capacities of 148 recombinant viruses encoding plasma-derived Gag-protease from 53 nontransmitter mothers, 48 transmitter mothers, and 47 infected infants were assayed in an HIV-1-inducible green fluorescent protein reporter cell line. All study participants were infected with HIV-1 subtype C. There was no significant difference in replication capacities between the nontransmitter (n = 53) and transmitter (n = 44) mothers (P = 0.48). Infant-derived Gag-protease NL4-3 recombinant viruses (n = 41) were found to have a significantly lower Gag-protease-driven replication capacity than that of viruses derived from the mothers (P < 0.0001 by a paired t test). High percent similarities to consensus subtype C Gag, p17, p24, and protease sequences were also found in the infants (n = 28) in comparison to their mothers (P = 0.07, P = 0.002, P = 0.03, and P = 0.02, respectively, as determined by a paired t test). These data suggest that of the viral quasispecies found in mothers, the HIV motherto- child transmission bottleneck favors the transmission of consensus-like viruses with lower viral replication capacities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human immunodeficiency virus", "Mother-to-child transmission", "Transmission bottleneck", "Viral replication capacity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Female", "gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Infant", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Logistic Models", "Male", "South Africa", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027327185", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55071460700": {"Name": "Naidoo V.L.", "AuthorID": "55071460700", "AffiliationID": "60017135, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R.
