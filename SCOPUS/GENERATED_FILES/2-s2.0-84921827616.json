In this study, 72 preschoolers institutionalised for at least 6 months were evaluated by their caregiver using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Disturbances of Attachment Interview. Distal and proximate indices of institutional caregiving quality were assessed using both staff reports and direct observation. Results revealed that greater caregiver sensitivity predicted reduced indiscriminate behaviour and secure-base distortions. A closer relationship with the caregiver predicted reduced inhibited attachment behaviour. Emotional and behavioural problems proved unrelated to caregiving quality. Results are discussed in terms of (non)-shared caregiving factors that influence institutionalised children's development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attachment disturbed behaviour", "emotional and behavioural problems", "institutional rearing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921827616", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"55085927700": {"Name": "Oliveira P.S.", "AuthorID": "55085927700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon R.M.P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006451757": {"Name": "Belsky J.", "AuthorID": "7006451757", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "56497104200": {"Name": "Fachada I.", "AuthorID": "56497104200", "AffiliationID": "60020475", "AffiliationName": "University of Minho"}, "57197387023": {"Name": "Soares I.", "AuthorID": "57197387023", "AffiliationID": "60020475", "AffiliationName": "University of Minho"}}}
