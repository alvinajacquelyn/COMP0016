However, little is known about their role in wound healing. Here we use live imaging of fat body cells, the equivalent of vertebrate adipocytes in Drosophila, to investigate their potential behaviors and functions following skin wounding. We find that pupal fat body cells are not immotile, as previously presumed, but actively migrate to wounds using an unusual adhesion-independent, actomyosin-driven, peristaltic mode of motility. Once at the wound, fat body cells collaborate with hemocytes, Drosophila macrophages, to clear the wound of cell debris; they also tightly seal the epithelial wound gap and locally release antimicrobial peptides to fight wound infection. Thus, fat body cells are motile cells, enabling them to migrate to wounds to undertake several local functions needed to drive wound repair and prevent infections. Adipocytes and their fly equivalent, fat body cells, have been considered immotile, but Franz et al. now show the latter can actively migrate to wounds using a peristaltic-like \u201cswimming\u201d motility. Once there, they multitask to clear wound cell debris, plug the epithelial gap, and upregulate AMPs to prevent infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adipocytes", "antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)", "cell migration", "Drosophila", "fat body", "hemocytes", "inflammatory response", "wound healing", "wound infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actomyosin", "Adipocytes", "Animals", "Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides", "Cell Movement", "Cells, Cultured", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Infections", "Fat Body", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044721039", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"24338041300": {"Name": "Franz A.", "AuthorID": "24338041300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biochemistry, Biomedical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57188567342": {"Name": "Martin P.", "AuthorID": "57188567342", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "56869463300": {"Name": "Wood W.", "AuthorID": "56869463300", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60015879, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Center for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}}}
