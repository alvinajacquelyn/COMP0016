Four serotypes are currently co-circulating. Diagnosis of infection may be by polymerase chain reaction, serology or rapid antigen test for NS1. Both pan-serotype and serotype-specific genome detection assays have been described, however, achieving adequate sensitivity with pan-serotype assays has been challenging. Indeed, as we show here, inspection of components and cycling parameters of a pan-serotype RT-qPCR assay in use in laboratories worldwide revealed insufficient probe stability to accommodate potential nucleotide mismatches, resulting in false-negatives. A minor-groove binder (MGB)-modified version of the probe was designed and its performance compared with that of the original probe in 32 samples. Eight of the samples were undetected by the original probe but detected by the MGB modified probe and six out of seven of these that could be serotyped belonged to serotype 4. Sequencing of the region targeted by the probe in these samples revealed two mismatches which were also universally present in all other serotype 4 sequences in a public database. We therefore recommend adoption of this MGB modification in order to reduce the risk of false-negative results, especially with dengue serotype 4 infections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dengue", "False-negative", "Minor groove binder", "Sensitivity", "Serotype 4", "TaqMan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Dengue", "Dengue Virus", "DNA Probes", "False Negative Reactions", "Humans", "Hydrolysis", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Viral", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Serogroup"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062901420", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36730986800": {"Name": "Gray E.R.", "AuthorID": "36730986800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Virology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55665377800": {"Name": "Ferns R.B.", "AuthorID": "55665377800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006765284": {"Name": "Garson J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006765284", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "National Transfusion Microbiology Laboratories, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "56727849500": {"Name": "Heaney J.", "AuthorID": "56727849500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Pathogen Diagnostics Unit, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16310245000": {"Name": "Nastouli E.", "AuthorID": "16310245000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population, Policy and Practice, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "57189349472": {"Name": "Sequeira P.C.", "AuthorID": "57189349472", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Flavivirus Laboratory, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz"}}}
