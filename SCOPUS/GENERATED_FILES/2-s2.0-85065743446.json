Among them, hundreds of lacemakers from the East Midlands went to work in northern France, especially Calais. Thanks to the 'bobbin-net' technology, they had a competitive lead. By emigrating, they could sell in French markets without paying duties or smuggling costs. They maintained close connections with the East Midlands, where they bought machinery and cotton thread, hired their workforce, and obtained first-hand information on patterns and techniques. These migrant artisans played a decisive part in boosting continental industrialisation and in creating a unified zone of production in north-western Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065743446", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"26034286000": {"Name": "Bensimon F.", "AuthorID": "26034286000", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"}}}
