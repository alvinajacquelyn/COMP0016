This paper aims to deploy multiple aerial BSs to cover a maximum number of ground users within a certain target area while avoiding inter-cell interference (ICI). Two techniques are proposed. The first method deploys multiple aerial BSs in a successive way and converts the non-convex constraints into various linear constraints which can be easily solved. The second method simultaneously deploys multiple aerial BSs by dividing the target area into K convex subareas with the help of K-means clustering. Simulation results show that both techniques achieve a performance gain compared to the benchmark circle packing theory (CPT).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Circle packing", "Ground infrastructures", "Intercell interference", "Linear constraints", "Non-convex constraints", "Performance Gain", "Sub-areas", "Wireless services"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060524834", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205199381": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "57205199381", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
