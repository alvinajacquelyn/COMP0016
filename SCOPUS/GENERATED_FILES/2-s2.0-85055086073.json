However, globally, there are increasingly numerous examples of studies of attitudes to civil justice. Robust standardised scales are important to establishing change and difference between groups; for example, in the context of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16.3. Past focus has been on developing \u2018composite indicators\u2019. This paper sees the application of modern psychometric methods to the construction of \u2018reflective\u2019 instruments to measure single unidimensional attitude dimensions. Drawing on relevant theoretical frameworks, we administered an item pool of 35 attitude questions to a sample of 1061 adults across England and Wales. Principal component analysis was used to identify attitude domains, followed by Rasch analysis to construct scales with acceptable psychometric properties. An Inaccessibility of Justice (IOJ) scale and a Perceived Inequality of Justice (PIJ) scale resulted. Respondents who regarded themselves as having handled past civil legal problems poorly or having experienced unfair outcomes had higher IOJ and PIJ scores. Negative accounts of lawyers or courts from others were also associated with higher scores. Our substantive findings help explain how negative experiences of problem resolution can result in \u2018frustrated resignation\u2019 for later problems, and show the importance of positive experiences and accounts of the justice system in maintaining public support. The scales have broad justice policy utility and the methods provide a template for future related scale development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Access to justice", "Attitudes", "Civil justice system", "Equality of justice", "Measurement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055086073", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"6603460657": {"Name": "Pleasence P.", "AuthorID": "6603460657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Laws, University College London"}, "6602210843": {"Name": "Balmer N.", "AuthorID": "6602210843", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Laws, University College London"}}}
