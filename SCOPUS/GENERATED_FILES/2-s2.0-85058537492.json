However, EOAD is notable for its phenotypic heterogeneity, with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) \u2013 characterised by prominent higher-order visual processing deficits and relative sparing of episodic memory \u2013 the second most common canonical phenotype. The hippocampus, which comprises a number of interconnected anatomically and functionally distinct subfields, is centrally involved in Alzheimer's disease and is a crucial mediator of episodic memory. The extent to which volumes of individual hippocampal subfields differ between different phenotypes in EOAD is unclear. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the hypothesis that patients with a PCA phenotype will exhibit differences in specific hippocampal subfield volumes compared to tAD. We studied 63 participants with volumetric T1-weighted MRI performed on the same 3T scanner: 39 EOAD patients [27 with tAD and 12 with PCA] and 24 age-matched controls. Volumetric estimates of the following hippocampal subfields for each participant were obtained using Freesurfer version 6.0: CA1, CA2/3, CA4, presubiculum, subiculum, hippocampal tail, parasubiculum, the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gryus (GCMLDG), the molecular layer, and the hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA). Linear regression analyses comparing mean hippocampal subfield volumes between groups, adjusting for age, sex and head size, were performed. Using a Bonferonni-corrected p-value of p < 0.0025, compared to controls, tAD was associated with atrophy in all hippocampal regions, except the parasubiculum. In PCA patients compared to controls, the strongest evidence for volume loss was in the left presubiclum, right subiculum, right GCMLDG, right molecular layer and the right HATA. Compared to PCA, patients with tAD had strong evidence for smaller volumes in left CA1 and left hippocampal tail. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that hippocampal subfield volumes differ in different phenotypes of EOAD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atypical Alzheimer's disease", "CA1", "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease", "Hippocampal subfields", "Posterior cortical atrophy", "Presubiculum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Size", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058537492", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55359123400": {"Name": "Parker T.D.", "AuthorID": "55359123400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "56095382000": {"Name": "Slattery C.F.", "AuthorID": "56095382000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "57204880602": {"Name": "Yong K.X.X.", "AuthorID": "57204880602", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "25630004900": {"Name": "Nicholas J.M.", "AuthorID": "25630004900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "56878719800": {"Name": "Foulkes A.J.M.", "AuthorID": "56878719800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "16637997400": {"Name": "Malone I.B.", "AuthorID": "16637997400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "56410615100": {"Name": "Cash D.M.", "AuthorID": "56410615100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.J.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.L.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
