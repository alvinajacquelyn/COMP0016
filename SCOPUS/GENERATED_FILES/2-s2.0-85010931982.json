Ischemic lesions are manually segmented by two independent observers in 1.5 T data from 20 subjects and an automatic algorithm using a random forest classifier is developed and trained on the annotations of observer 1. The algorithm obtains a median sensitivity and specificity of 0.72 and 0.99 respectively. F1-scores are calculated per subject for algorithm performance (median = 0.52) and observer 2 performance (median = 0.56). A paired t-test on the F1-scores shows no statistical difference between the algorithm and observer 2 performances. The method is applied to a larger dataset including 54 additional subjects scanned at both 1.5 T and 3.0 T. The algorithm findings are shown to correspond well with the injury pattern noted by clinicians in both 1.5 T and 3.0 T data and to have a strong relationship with outcome. The results of the automatic method are condensed to a single score for each subject which has significant correlation with an MR score assigned by experienced clinicians (p < 0.0001). This work represents a quantitative method of evaluating diffusion-weighted MR images in neonatal HIE and a first step in the development of an automatic system for more in-depth analysis and prognostication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automatic quantification", "Diffusion-weighted lesions", "HIE", "MRI", "Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy", "Segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Brain", "Brain Ischemia", "Brain Mapping", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "False Positive Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Infant, Newborn", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010931982", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"24332601100": {"Name": "Murphy K.", "AuthorID": "24332601100", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork, Dept. of Paediatrics and Child Health"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork, Dept. of Paediatrics and Child Health"}, "37462045800": {"Name": "van der Aa N.", "AuthorID": "37462045800", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Neonatology, University Medical Center, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital"}, "36181450700": {"Name": "Negro S.", "AuthorID": "36181450700", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena"}, "56186807700": {"Name": "Groenendaal F.", "AuthorID": "56186807700", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Neonatology, University Medical Center, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital"}, "35551564900": {"Name": "de Vries L.", "AuthorID": "35551564900", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Neonatology, University Medical Center, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital"}, "56030466500": {"Name": "Benders M.", "AuthorID": "56030466500", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Neonatology, University Medical Center, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital"}, "57203030739": {"Name": "Viergever M.", "AuthorID": "57203030739", "AffiliationID": "60012273, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center"}, "6507874503": {"Name": "I\u0161gum I.", "AuthorID": "6507874503", "AffiliationID": "60012273, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center"}}}
