Methods: A single centre retrospective observational study was performed on consecutive patients diagnosed with AAS and discharged between 2000 and 2016: 242 surgically treated type A, 87 uncomplicated, medically treated type B, and 80 complicated type B who received endovascular/surgical/hybrid treatment. Follow up of discharged patients (5 \u00b1 3.9 years) was almost complete by the end of the study (December 2017). Results: The mean age was 65.3 \u00b1 12.5 years, and 70.2% were men. Long-term all cause mortality was 5.4 per 100 patients per year in surgically treated type A AAS patients and 6.7 per 100 patients per year in type B AAS patients (p =.236). The rates of major aorta related events were 6.1 per 100 patients per year and 13.4 per 100 patients per year, respectively (p <.001). Non-aorta related events during long-term follow up occurred in 18.2 per 100 patients per year in type A and 13.8 per 100 patients per year in type B (p =.055). At the end of follow up 279/409 (68.2%) patients (165/242 type A and 114/167 type B) experienced at least one event. Conclusions: Among patients with either type A or type B AAS surviving the acute phase, the risk of adverse aorta and non-aorta related events, including death, persists during follow up, so that eventually two thirds of patients will experience at least one event. Notably, all cause mortality after type B AAS exceeds that of type A AAS after three years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute aortic syndromes", "Follow up", "Outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Aged", "Aortic Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Syndrome", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047087742", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56457845900": {"Name": "Corsini A.", "AuthorID": "56457845900", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "7004626223": {"Name": "Pacini D.", "AuthorID": "7004626223", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "6701832648": {"Name": "Lovato L.", "AuthorID": "6701832648", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "57221921222": {"Name": "Russo V.", "AuthorID": "57221921222", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "35620484900": {"Name": "Lorenzini M.", "AuthorID": "35620484900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute for Cardiovascular Science and Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57191280955": {"Name": "Fo\u00e0 A.", "AuthorID": "57191280955", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "7004143746": {"Name": "Leone O.", "AuthorID": "7004143746", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "7004544382": {"Name": "Nanni S.", "AuthorID": "7004544382", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "56605090800": {"Name": "Mingardi F.", "AuthorID": "56605090800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "56962741700": {"Name": "Reggiani L.B.", "AuthorID": "56962741700", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "57218682748": {"Name": "Melandri G.", "AuthorID": "57218682748", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "6701833565": {"Name": "Di Bartolomeo R.", "AuthorID": "6701833565", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}, "7005883289": {"Name": "Rapezzi C.", "AuthorID": "7005883289", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology, Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna"}}}
