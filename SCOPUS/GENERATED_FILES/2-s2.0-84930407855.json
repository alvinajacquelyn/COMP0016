Patients and method: Ninety patients who had Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) and 45 male patients who had an optical urethrotomy or urethral dilatation for urethral stricture disease, who had a prior urodynamics study, were evaluated. Results: Patients with urethral stricture disease had lower closure pressures than those undergoing TURP (22.07 vs. 28.4 cmH<inf>2</inf>O, p=0.0039, r=0.61). However, the slope of the passive urethral relation was indistinguishable between the two groups. Only 60% of patients with symptomatic urethral strictures were categorised as unequivocally obstructed by the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram. Conclusion: Urethral strictures are associated with lower closure pressures than prostatic obstruction; however, there was no difference in the urethral resistance relation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)", "dilatation", "strictures", "Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP)", "urethrotomy", "Urodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930407855", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"35145455800": {"Name": "Bishara S.", "AuthorID": "35145455800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Barnet and Chase Farm NHS Trust"}, "26435228400": {"Name": "Foley C.", "AuthorID": "26435228400", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Lister Hospital Stevenage"}, "35611794500": {"Name": "Peters J.", "AuthorID": "35611794500", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology Whipps Cross University Hospital London"}, "6604059963": {"Name": "Philp T.", "AuthorID": "6604059963", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology Whipps Cross University Hospital London"}, "7003536229": {"Name": "Malone-Lee J.", "AuthorID": "7003536229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine University College London"}}}
