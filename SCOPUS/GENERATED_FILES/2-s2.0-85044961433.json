Although operator training simulators (OTS) used in the traditional chemical process industries may be used to train biorefinery operators and engineers, several distinct aspects of bioprocess operations make their direct application limited. The development and deployment of OTSs for use in biotechnological processes is therefore beginning to gain increasing attention. This review paper examines the present status of OTS development and use in biorefineries, including future considerations on how an OTS may be used to improve operator competence, maximise biorefinery operational efficiencies and protect people and the environment. The general premise of an OTS is that model-based operator training simulators can be used to verifiably enhance the training of industrial operators to run complex biorefineries. Only a few examples of the design and application of OTSs in large-scale biorefineries have so far been reported. A discussion of the mathematical models used for OTS development is briefly presented, as well as available OTS design frameworks and vendors, including their benefits and drawbacks. The review concludes by looking at possible future directions of OTS development and use in biorefineries and their contribution in facilitating the transition to a bio-based economy. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioprocess", "biorefinery", "competence", "education", "OTS", "simulator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative energy source", "Bioprocesses", "Biorefineries", "Biotechnological process", "Chemical process industry", "Competence", "Operational efficiencies", "Operator training simulator"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044961433", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56394514200": {"Name": "Isimite J.", "AuthorID": "56394514200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603502108": {"Name": "Baganz F.", "AuthorID": "6603502108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55881526500": {"Name": "Hass V.", "AuthorID": "55881526500", "AffiliationID": "60078281", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Bioprocess Engineering Research Group, Hochschule Furtwangen University, Jakob-Kienzle-Str. 17"}}}
