The millimeter-wave design is based on a diplexer, two Chebyshev bandpass filters, one for uplink (61,7GHz to 62,7 GHz) and one for downlink (59,3 GHz to 60,3 GHz) and one common 8x8 Slot array antenna, integrated on the same substrate. E/M simulations of a fully integrated planar RF Front End provide very good results, both in diplexer and filters and in antenna characteristics. Finally, a consideration regarding transition requirements for integration with a coplanar waveguide (CPW) photodiode is being presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GCPW array antennas", "Radio over fiber", "SIW RF Front End", "System On Substrate"], "IndexKeywords": ["60 GHz radio over fibers", "Antenna characteristics", "Array antennas", "Chebyshev bandpass filters", "Coplanar wave-guide (CPW)", "Millimeter-wave design", "RF front end", "Slot array antennas"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923872671", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24490958500": {"Name": "Makris D.", "AuthorID": "24490958500", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Technological Educational Institute of Athens"}, "15137231900": {"Name": "Tsiakas P.", "AuthorID": "15137231900", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Technological Educational Institute of Athens"}, "12789877100": {"Name": "Voudouris K.", "AuthorID": "12789877100", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Technological Educational Institute of Athens"}, "56114372900": {"Name": "Thakur M.", "AuthorID": "56114372900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7801636324": {"Name": "Mikroulis S.", "AuthorID": "7801636324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
