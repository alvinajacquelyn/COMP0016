It is one of three allelic disorders associated to CACNA1A gene, coding for the Alpha1 A subunit of P/Q type calcium channel Cav2.1 expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum. The other two disorders are Episodic Ataxia type 2 (EA2), and Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1). These disorders show distinct phenotypes that often overlap but have different pathogenic mechanisms. EA2 and FHM1 are due to mutations causing, respectively, a loss and a gain of channel function. SCA6, instead, is associated with short expansions of a polyglutamine stretch located in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the protein. This domain has a relevant role in channel regulation, as well as in transcription regulation of other neuronal genes; thus the SCA6 CAG repeat expansion results in complex pathogenic molecular mechanisms reflecting the complex Cav2.1 C-terminus activity. We will provide a short review for an update on the SCA6 molecular mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CACNA1A", "CaV2.1", "Channelopathy", "P/Q type calcium channel", "Polyglutamine disorder", "SCA6", "Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 6"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923223720", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6603845190": {"Name": "Giunti P.", "AuthorID": "6603845190", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6701815729": {"Name": "Mantuano E.", "AuthorID": "6701815729", "AffiliationID": "60112694, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Research Council of Italy"}, "55779942800": {"Name": "Frontali M.", "AuthorID": "55779942800", "AffiliationID": "60112694, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Research Council of Italy"}, "6701460768": {"Name": "Veneziano L.", "AuthorID": "6701460768", "AffiliationID": "60112694, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Research Council of Italy"}}}
