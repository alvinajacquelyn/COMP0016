The Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone system is essential for function of normal and neoplastic cells. Here we uncover the mechanistic inter-relationships between these proteins by combining approaches including NMR, HDX-MS, and SAXS. We show that several disease-linked mutations convert FGFR3 to a stronger client, where the determinant underpinning client strength involves an allosteric network through the N-lobe and at the lobe interface. We determine the architecture of the client kinase/Cdc37 complex and demonstrate, together with site-specific information, that binding of Cdc37 to unrelated kinases induces a common, extensive conformational remodeling of the kinase N-lobe, beyond localized changes and interactions within the binary complex. As further shown for FGFR3, this processing by Cdc37 deactivates the kinase and presents it, in a specific orientation established in the complex, for direct recognition by Hsp90. In their work, Bunney et al. propose a model in which the cochaperone Cdc37 plays a dual role in binding and remodeling its kinase clients, thus allowing recognition by the chaperone, Hsp90. The overall architecture of a Cdc37/FGFR3 complex is also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "Cdc37 cochaperone", "client kinases", "disease-linked mutations", "fibroblast growth factor receptors", "Hsp90 chaperone", "protein folding", "structural and mechanistic insights"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allosteric Site", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Chaperonins", "HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3", "Scattering, Small Angle", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042333743", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"6506106414": {"Name": "Bunney T.D.", "AuthorID": "6506106414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "6508025093": {"Name": "Sanfelice D.", "AuthorID": "6508025093", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "8635995300": {"Name": "Thiyagarajan N.", "AuthorID": "8635995300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7102317240": {"Name": "Katan M.", "AuthorID": "7102317240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "56184434100": {"Name": "Inglis A.J.", "AuthorID": "56184434100", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "55363980700": {"Name": "Masson G.R.", "AuthorID": "55363980700", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "56922656500": {"Name": "Williams R.L.", "AuthorID": "56922656500", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "57200729902": {"Name": "Farrell B.", "AuthorID": "57200729902", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences"}, "7403077705": {"Name": "Thompson G.S.", "AuthorID": "7403077705", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences"}, "7004371163": {"Name": "Breeze A.L.", "AuthorID": "7004371163", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences"}, "55545860909": {"Name": "Kerr C.J.", "AuthorID": "55545860909", "AffiliationID": "60006031, 60030635", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hamburg Outstation, DESY"}, "18134896800": {"Name": "Svergun D.I.", "AuthorID": "18134896800", "AffiliationID": "60006031, 60030635", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hamburg Outstation, DESY"}}}
