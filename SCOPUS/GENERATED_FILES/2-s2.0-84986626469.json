Herein, we demonstrate that cell membrane remodeling with a thermoresponsive boronic acid copolymer induces the rapid formation of spheroids using either cancer or cardiac cell lines under conventional cell culture conditions at minute concentrations. It is shown that the formation of well-defined spheroids is accelerated by at least 24 h compared to non-polymer-treated controls, and, more importantly, the polymer allows for fine control of the aggregation kinetics owing to its stimulus response to temperature and glucose content. On the basis of its simplicity and effectiveness to promote cellular aggregation, this platform holds promise in three-dimensional tissue/tumor modeling and tissue engineering applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D cell culture", "boronic acid", "cell spheroids", "cell surface engineering", "cell therapy", "PNIPAAm", "thermoresponsive polymer", "tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D cell culture", "Boronic acid", "Cell spheroids", "Cell surface engineering", "Cell therapy", "PNIPAAm", "Thermoresponsive polymer", "Biocompatible Materials", "Boronic Acids", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Polymers", "Spheroids, Cellular", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986626469", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56982563100": {"Name": "Amaral A.", "AuthorID": "56982563100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London (UCL)"}, "21743908000": {"Name": "Pasparakis G.", "AuthorID": "21743908000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London (UCL)"}}}
