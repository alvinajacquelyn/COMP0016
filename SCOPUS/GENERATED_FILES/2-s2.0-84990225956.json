Nevertheless, victimization and perpetration remain undetected by mental health services. This paper reviews the evidence on mental health service responses to domestic violence, including identifying, referring, and providing care for people experiencing or perpetrating violence. The review highlights the need for mental health services to improve rates of identification and responses to domestic violence and abuse, through the provision of specific training on domestic violence and abuse, the implementation of clear information sharing protocols and evidence-based interventions, and the establishment of care referral pathways. This review also highlights the need for further research into mental health service users who perpetrate domestic violence and abuse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domestic violence and abuse", "intervention", "mental health", "mental health services", "perpetrators"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crime Victims", "Domestic Violence", "Humans", "Mental Health Services"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990225956", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36093631800": {"Name": "Trevillion K.", "AuthorID": "36093631800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women\u2019s Mental Health, King\u2019s College London"}, "55879300400": {"Name": "Capron L.E.", "AuthorID": "55879300400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women\u2019s Mental Health, King\u2019s College London"}, "34873135200": {"Name": "Oram S.", "AuthorID": "34873135200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women\u2019s Mental Health, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602695193": {"Name": "Corker E.", "AuthorID": "6602695193", "AffiliationID": "60159384", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry, Newham Centre for Mental Health"}}}
