In this study, agency was operationalized as a set of behaviour indicators of children\u2019s control (behavioural agency), adults\u2019 perceptions of reader identities afforded by the content and format of books (social agency), and specific multimedia and interactive features that afford personalisation (agentic design). In a comparative qualitative case study, seven preschool children and their mothers were observed reading four story-based interactive e-books (story-apps). Multimethod analysis that combined design evaluation with observational and interview data revealed behavioural agency was demonstrated in the children\u2019s frequent, prolonged, and repetitive physical engagement with the story-apps. Social agency became foregrounded in relation to constitutive reader identities. Agentic design was related to children\u2019s sense of autonomy. The findings have implications for how we theorize, operationalize, and apply the concept of agency in children\u2019s e-books and reading for pleasure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agency", "apps", "e-books", "early reading", "reading engagement", "reading motivation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057581761", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Education"}}}
