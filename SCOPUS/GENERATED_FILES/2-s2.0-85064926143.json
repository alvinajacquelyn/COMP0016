Potentially hazardous phenomena as wide-ranging as ash, noxious gases, lava flows, pyroclastic density currents and tsunamis differ in terms of nature, predictability, scale, extent, impact and perception. As such, a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach does not provide the most effective means of addressing the communication of volcanic hazards, and while general principles apply, warnings that seek to manage and mitigate the effects of individual hazardous phenomena need to be adapted or tailored.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064926143", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56234897500": {"Name": "McGuire W.", "AuthorID": "56234897500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, UCL Hazard Centre, University College London"}, "8869544900": {"Name": "Fearnley C.", "AuthorID": "8869544900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology, University College London"}}}
