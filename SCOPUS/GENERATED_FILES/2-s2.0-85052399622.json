This included investigation of sex differences and the extent to which associations may be mediated by adiposity. Methods and Results-\u2014Participants were 795 men and 827 women aged 60 to 64 years from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development. Combined heart rate and movement sensors worn for 5 consecutive days were used to derive overall PA energy expenditure, kJ/kg per day) and time spent sedentary (<1.5 metabolic equivalent of tasks), in light PA (1.5\u20133 metabolic equivalent of tasks) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (>3 metabolic equivalent of tasks). Linear regression models were used to relate each PA parameter to inflammatory (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), endothelial (tissue-plasminogen activator, E-selectin) and adipokine (leptin, adiponectin) markers extracted from fasting blood samples. Greater time in light PA and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA and less sedentary time were associated with more favorable biomarker levels. For C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and leptin, these differences were greater among women than men. For example, % differences (95% confidence intervals) in leptin for men and women per SD increases in sedentary time: 7.9 (2.7, 13.0) and 20.6 (15.3, 25.8); moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA: \u20133.8 (\u20138.9, 12.7) and \u201317.7 (\u201323.1, \u201312.4), moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA: \u201312.9 (\u201317.9, \u20138.0) and \u201318.3 (\u201323.4, \u201313.1). Fat mass mediated a greater proportion of these associations in women than men. Conclusions-\u2014Greater light PA and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA and less sedentary time in early old age were associated with more favorable cardiovascular biomarker profiles. Fat mass partially mediated these associations but more strongly in women than men, which explained sex differences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometers", "Aging", "Cardiac biomarkers", "Heart rate", "Older adults", "Physical exercise", "Sedentary time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adiponectin", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "E-Selectin", "Energy Metabolism", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Leptin", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sedentary Behavior", "Time Factors", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052399622", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"37072041500": {"Name": "Elhakeem A.", "AuthorID": "37072041500", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School University of Bristol"}, "35354537000": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "35354537000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George\u2019s University of London"}, "7003968294": {"Name": "Brage S.", "AuthorID": "7003968294", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}}}
