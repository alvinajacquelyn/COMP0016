Published by BMJ.The frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative syndromes with overlapping clinical, molecular and pathological features, all of which challenge the design of clinical trials in these conditions. To date, no pharmacological interventions have been proven effective in significantly modifying the course of these disorders. This study critically reviews the construct and methodology of previously published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in FTD spectrum disorders in order to identify limitations and potential reasons for negative results. Moreover, recommendations based on the identified gaps are elaborated in order to guide future clinical trial design. A systematic literature review was carried out and presented in conformity with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. A total of 23 RCTs in cohorts with diagnoses of behavioural and language variants of FTD, corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome were identified out of the 943 citations retrieved and were included in the qualitative review. Most studies identified were early-phase clinical trials that were small in size, short in duration and frequently underpowered. Diagnoses of populations enrolled in clinical trials were based on clinical presentation and rarely included precision-medicine tools, such as genetic and molecular testing. Uniformity and standardisation of research outcomes in the FTD spectrum are essential. Several elements should be carefully considered and planned in future clinical trials. We anticipate that precision-medicine approaches will be crucial to adequately address heterogeneity in the FTD spectrum research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["frontotemporal dementia", "neurogenetics", "pharmacology", "randomised trials", "systematic reviews"], "IndexKeywords": ["Frontotemporal Dementia", "Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration", "Humans", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Reference Standards", "Research Design", "Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055560434", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57189708520": {"Name": "Desmarais P.", "AuthorID": "57189708520", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "7004107743": {"Name": "Masellis M.", "AuthorID": "7004107743", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto"}, "35400981300": {"Name": "Black S.E.", "AuthorID": "35400981300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto"}, "56116676300": {"Name": "Stuss D.T.", "AuthorID": "56116676300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Toronto"}, "57200105561": {"Name": "Lang A.E.", "AuthorID": "57200105561", "AffiliationID": "60193811, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto"}, "12773657100": {"Name": "Tartaglia M.C.", "AuthorID": "12773657100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.D.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57189711912": {"Name": "Nguyen Q.D.", "AuthorID": "57189711912", "AffiliationID": "60009657", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "7102947194": {"Name": "Herrmann N.", "AuthorID": "7102947194", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto"}, "6701463422": {"Name": "Boxer A.L.", "AuthorID": "6701463422", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "57210807888": {"Name": "Rosen H.", "AuthorID": "57210807888", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "7003918293": {"Name": "Dickerson B.C.", "AuthorID": "7003918293", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "7005866070": {"Name": "Van Swieten J.C.", "AuthorID": "7005866070", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Centre"}, "57188985946": {"Name": "Meeter L.H.", "AuthorID": "57188985946", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Centre"}, "6701398657": {"Name": "Borroni B.", "AuthorID": "6701398657", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurodegenerative Disorders, Neurology Clinic, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia"}, "7201854388": {"Name": "Feldman H.H.", "AuthorID": "7201854388", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}}}
