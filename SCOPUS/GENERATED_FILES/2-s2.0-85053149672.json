We have developed an analytical method whereby InsP7 and its precursor inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) are determined directly and sensitively using tandem mass spectrometry coupled with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). InsP6 and InsP7 peak symmetry is influenced greatly by the buffer salt composition and pH of the mobile phase used in HILIC analysis. The use of 300 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 10.5) as an aqueous mobile phase resolves InsP6 and InsP7 on a polymer-based amino HILIC column with minimal peak tailing. Method validation shows that InsP6 and InsP7 can be quantitated from 20\u2013500 pmol with minimal intra-day/inter-day variance in peak area and retention time. The concentration of InsP6 in C57BL/6J mouse brain (40.68 \u00b1 3.84 pmol/mg wet weight) is successfully determined. HILIC\u2012MS/MS analysis using HEK293 culture cells confirms previous observations that InsP7 is induced by NaF treatment and ectopic expression of InsP6K2, a primary kinase for InsP7 synthesis. Furthermore, this analysis reveals the abundance of InsP6 (50.46 \u00b1 18.57 pmol/106 cells) and scarcity of InsP7 in human blood cells. The results demonstrate that HILIC\u2012MS/MS analysis can quantitate endogenous InsP6 and InsP7 in mouse and human samples, and we expect that the method will contribute to further understanding of InsP7 functions in mammalian pathobiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate", "Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography", "Inositol hexakisphosphate", "Inositol polyphosphate", "Tandem mass spectrometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate", "Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographies", "Inositol hexakisphosphate", "Polyphosphates", "Tandem mass spectrometry", "Animals", "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical", "Chromatography, Liquid", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Inositol Phosphates", "Mammals", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053149672", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57013873200": {"Name": "Ito M.", "AuthorID": "57013873200", "AffiliationID": "121343746", "AffiliationName": "Support Center for Medical Research and Education"}, "57203843395": {"Name": "Sasaki A.", "AuthorID": "57203843395", "AffiliationID": "121343746", "AffiliationName": "Support Center for Medical Research and Education"}, "56703897000": {"Name": "Tanaka M.", "AuthorID": "56703897000", "AffiliationID": "121343746", "AffiliationName": "Support Center for Medical Research and Education"}, "55963261700": {"Name": "Fujii N.", "AuthorID": "55963261700", "AffiliationID": "60028799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Tokai University School of Medicine"}, "57218996737": {"Name": "Takizawa S.", "AuthorID": "57218996737", "AffiliationID": "60028799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Tokai University School of Medicine"}, "55252926900": {"Name": "Nagata E.", "AuthorID": "55252926900", "AffiliationID": "60028799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Tokai University School of Medicine"}, "57203839785": {"Name": "Wittwer C.", "AuthorID": "57203839785", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Freiburg"}, "57203837115": {"Name": "Bittner T.", "AuthorID": "57203837115", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Freiburg"}, "10641609900": {"Name": "Jessen H.J.", "AuthorID": "10641609900", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Freiburg"}, "6701885812": {"Name": "Saiardi A.", "AuthorID": "6701885812", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology Unit, Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
