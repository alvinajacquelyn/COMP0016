Published by IOP Publishing Ltd on behalf of Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.Quantum mechanics, in principle, allows for processes with indefinite causal order. However, most of these causal anomalies have not yet been detected experimentally. We show that every such process can be simulated experimentally by means of non-Markovian dynamics with a measurement on additional degrees of freedom. In detail, we provide an explicit construction to implement arbitrary a causal processes. Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for open system dynamics with measurement to yield processes that respect causality locally, and find that tripartite entanglement and nonlocal unitary transformations are crucial requirements for the simulation of causally indefinite processes. These results show a direct connection between three counter-intuitive concepts: entanglement, non-Markovianity, and causal non-separability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["causally disordered processes", "entanglement", "non-Markovianity"], "IndexKeywords": ["entanglement", "Explicit constructions", "Non-markovian dynamics", "non-Markovianity", "Non-separability", "System Dynamics", "Tripartite entanglement", "Unitary transformations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044936749", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56464852200": {"Name": "Milz S.", "AuthorID": "56464852200", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}, "55814176100": {"Name": "Pollock F.A.", "AuthorID": "55814176100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}, "57203386239": {"Name": "Le T.P.", "AuthorID": "57203386239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57204254646": {"Name": "Modi K.", "AuthorID": "57204254646", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}, "6508220796": {"Name": "Chiribella G.", "AuthorID": "6508220796", "AffiliationID": "60114499", "AffiliationName": "HKU Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation"}}}
