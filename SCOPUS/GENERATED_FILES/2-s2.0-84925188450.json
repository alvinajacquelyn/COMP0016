Setting London Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom. Design Prospective interventional pilot study. Method Eyes with bilateral, intermediate, or advanced dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD); preoperative decimal corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 0.25 or less; and improvement with extraocular simulation of the intervention had implantation of 2 IOLs designed for use together in a Galilean telescope configuration (iolAMD). Patients were followed for 4 months. Safety was assessed by monitoring visual acuity, intraocular pressure, specular microscopy, and anterior segment and macular optical coherence tomographies. Fixation stability and macular sensitivity were determined using microperimetry in some eyes. Results There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications. In 1 eye, an anterior sulcus IOL was replaced; there were no sequelae. The mean endothelial cell density was reduced by 18%. The mean decimal CDVA improved from 0.12 preoperatively to 0.20 at 4 months, a 67% gain. The mean change in spherical equivalent after implantation was -1.5 diopters (D) with 0.5 D of induced astigmatism. Microperimetric testing indicated a magnification effect and a deviation of the retinal image by up to 5 degrees, with improved fixation stability. Conclusions This injectable intraocular miniature telescope appears safe in the short to medium term and capable of improving visual function. No significant issues were encountered regarding candidate eye selection or patient retention and cooperation. Further work is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device, particularly with respect to daily-living activities and the range of indications.
