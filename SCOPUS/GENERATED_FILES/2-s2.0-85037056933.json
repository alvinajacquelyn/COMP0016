Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds via 1,4-conjugate addition of the nucleophile to the unsaturated system to give a key alkenyl lithium species which is stabilised by an intramolecular coordination effect by a sulfonamide oxygen atom. This species can be considered a vinylidene carbenoid given the carbon atom bears both an anion (as a vinyllithium) and a leaving group (the sulfonamide). The intramolecular coordination effect serves to stabilise the vinyllithium but activates the sulfonamide motif towards nucleophilic attack by a second mole of acetylide. The resulting species can then undergo rearrangement to yield the enediyne framework in a single operation with concomitant loss of aminosulfinate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,4-Conjugate addition", "Alkynyl sulfonamides", "Carbon atoms", "Intramolecular coordination", "Leaving groups", "Lithium acetylides", "Mechanistic studies", "Nucleophilic attack"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037056933", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57191344721": {"Name": "Hayes T.", "AuthorID": "57191344721", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54785285800": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "54785285800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55695756600": {"Name": "Radigois M.", "AuthorID": "55695756600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003846767": {"Name": "Wilden J.", "AuthorID": "7003846767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006830592": {"Name": "Horan R.", "AuthorID": "7006830592", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithkline, Medicines Research Centre"}}}
