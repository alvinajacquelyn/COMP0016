In some applications such videos have to provide real-time visual feedback to the pilot with an acceptable distortion while satisfying high-quality requirements at playback. Furthermore the output rate of the source encoder required to achieve a target distortion depends on the speed of the platform. Motivated by this, we consider a novel source model which takes the source speed into account and derive its rate-distortion region. A transmission strategy based on successive joint encoding, which efficiently takes the source correlation into account, is then considered for transmission over a block fading channel. Our numerical results show that such scheme largely enhances over an independent coding scheme in terms of on-line distortion while approaching the playback distortion performance of an optimal encoder as the group of pictures size grows.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Block fading channel", "Distortion performance", "Numerical results", "Rate distortion region", "Real time visual feedback", "Source correlation", "Stringent constraints", "Transmission strategies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070206450", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36550207000": {"Name": "Cocco G.", "AuthorID": "36550207000", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "LTS4 Signal Processing Labor Atory, Laboratory of Intelligent Systems Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"}, "24725809400": {"Name": "Toni L.", "AuthorID": "24725809400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
