Here we present ultra-high resolution (70-140. year) joint foraminiferal isotopic and pollen analyses from IODP Site U1385 off Portugal, focusing on a short glacial section of Marine Isotope Stage 38, ~. 1.26. million. years ago. Our records reveal the presence of millennial-scale variability in the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system in the North Atlantic and provide the first direct evidence for the response of western Iberian vegetation to abrupt climate changes in the Early Pleistocene. The magnitude and pacing of changes bear significant similarities to Dansgaard-Oeschger variability of the last two glacials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early Pleistocene", "Millennial-scale-variability", "Pollen", "Portugal", "Vegetation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abrupt climate change", "Early pleistocene", "Marine isotope stages", "Millennial-scale-variability", "Pollen", "Portugal", "Terrestrial ecosystems", "Ultrahigh resolution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954126468", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"]], "AuthorData": {"6603907728": {"Name": "Tzedakis P.", "AuthorID": "6603907728", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "15072991400": {"Name": "Margari V.", "AuthorID": "15072991400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7004762788": {"Name": "Hodell D.", "AuthorID": "7004762788", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge"}}}
