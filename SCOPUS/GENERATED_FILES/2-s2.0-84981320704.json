By tracking mountain chicken (Leptodactylus fallax) populations before, during and after the emergence of chytridiomycosis, we quantified the real-time species level impacts of this disease. We report a range-wide species decline amongst the fastest ever recorded, with a loss of over 85% of the population in fewer than 18 months on Dominica and near extinction on Montserrat. Genetic diversity declined in the wild, but emergency measures to establish a captive assurance population captured a representative sample of genetic diversity from Montserrat. If the Convention on Biological Diversity's targets are to be met, it is important to evaluate the reasons why they appear consistently unattainable. The emergence of chytridiomycosis in the mountain chicken was predictable, but the decline could not be prevented. There is an urgent need to build mitigation capacity where amphibians are at risk from chytridiomycosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Domestic", "Animals, Wild", "Anura", "Chytridiomycota", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Dominica", "Extinction, Biological", "Genetic Variation", "Population Dynamics", "West Indies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981320704", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55656978900": {"Name": "Hudson M.A.", "AuthorID": "55656978900", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Les Augres Manor"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "14720492700": {"Name": "Young R.P.", "AuthorID": "14720492700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus"}, "55227062300": {"Name": "Griffiths R.A.", "AuthorID": "55227062300", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Les Augres Manor"}, "57190585433": {"Name": "D'Urban Jackson J.", "AuthorID": "57190585433", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology AndBiochemistry, University of Bath"}, "14626641400": {"Name": "Orozco-Terwengel P.", "AuthorID": "14626641400", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Sir Martin Evans Building"}, "56840234000": {"Name": "Bruford M.W.", "AuthorID": "56840234000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Places Research Institute, Cardiff University"}, "57040318500": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "57040318500", "AffiliationID": "117124292", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environment, Montserrat Ministry of Agriculture, Housing, Lands and Environment"}, "57212414138": {"Name": "James A.", "AuthorID": "57212414138", "AffiliationID": "117124659", "AffiliationName": "Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries"}, "56386138800": {"Name": "Sulton M.", "AuthorID": "56386138800", "AffiliationID": "117124659", "AffiliationName": "Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries"}, "22934092100": {"Name": "Garcia G.", "AuthorID": "22934092100", "AffiliationID": "60109277", "AffiliationName": "Chester Zoo, Cedar House"}, "56384742400": {"Name": "Thomas R.", "AuthorID": "56384742400", "AffiliationID": "117124659", "AffiliationName": "Division of Agriculture, Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries"}, "57190579313": {"Name": "Magin C.", "AuthorID": "57190579313", "AffiliationID": "60021721", "AffiliationName": "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"}}}
