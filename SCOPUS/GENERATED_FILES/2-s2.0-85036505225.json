Closure of the optic fissure is essential for subsequent growth and development of the eye. A defect in this process can leave a gap in the iris, retina or optic nerve, known as a coloboma, which can lead to severe visual impairment. This review brings together current information about genes and pathways regulating fissure closure from human coloboma patients and animal models. It focuses especially on current understanding of the morphological changes and processes of epithelial remodelling occurring at the fissure margins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coloboma", "Colobomos", "Congenital eye malformation", "Eye development", "Optic fissure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Coloboma", "Eye", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Morphogenesis", "Optic Disk", "Signal Transduction", "Vision Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036505225", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56119319800": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "56119319800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, University College London"}, "35556156400": {"Name": "Sowden J.C.", "AuthorID": "35556156400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, University College London"}}}
