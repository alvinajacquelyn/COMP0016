All rights reserved.The increasing efficiency of the inorganic-organic hybrid halides has revolutionised photovoltaic research. Despite this rapid progress, the significant issues of poor stability and toxicity have yet to be suitably overcome. In this article, we use Density Functional Theory to examine (Pb2I6)\u00b7(H2DPNDI)\u00b7(H2O)\u00b7(NMP), an alternative lead-based hybrid inorganic-organic solar absorber based on a photoactive organic cation. Our results demonstrate that optical properties suitable for photovoltaic applications, in addition to spatial electron-hole separation, are possible but efficient charge transport may be a limiting factor.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957551039", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}}}
