In this study, we examine the dynamics of three radical cations starting from an excited ionic state using trajectory surface hopping dynamics in combination with multiconfigurational electronic structure methods. The efficiency of relaxation to the ground state is examined in an effort to understand better whether fragmentation of cations is likely to occur directly on excited states or after relaxation to the ground state. The results on cyclohexadiene, hexatriene, and uracil indicate that relaxation to the ground ionic state is very fast in these systems, while fragmentation before relaxation is rare. Ultrafast relaxation is facilitated by the close proximity of electronic states and the presence of two- and three-state conical intersections. Examining the properties of the systems in the Franck-Condon region can give some insight into the subsequent dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Close proximity", "Conical intersection", "Cyclohexadienes", "Ionization process", "Relaxation dynamics", "Surface hopping", "Trajectory surface hopping", "Ultrafast relaxation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955518415", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"26643727600": {"Name": "Assmann M.", "AuthorID": "26643727600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "6701418521": {"Name": "Matsika S.", "AuthorID": "6701418521", "AffiliationID": "60030398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Temple University"}, "6602071589": {"Name": "Weinacht T.", "AuthorID": "6602071589", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stony Brook University"}}}
