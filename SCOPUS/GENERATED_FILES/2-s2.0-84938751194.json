Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.TRIM5\u03b1 is an antiviral, cytoplasmic, E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that assembles on incoming retroviral capsids and induces their premature dissociation. It inhibits reverse transcription of the viral genome and can also synthesize unanchored polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains to stimulate innate immune responses. Here, we show that TRIM5\u03b1 employs the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme Ube2W to anchor the Lys63-linked polyUb chains in a process of TRIM5\u03b1 auto-ubiquitination. Chain anchoring is initiated, in cells and in vitro, through Ube2W-catalyzed monoubiquitination of TRIM5\u03b1. This modification serves as a substrate for the elongation of anchored Lys63-linked polyUb chains, catalyzed by the heterodimeric E2 enzyme Ube2N/Ube2V2. Ube2W targets multiple TRIM5\u03b1 internal lysines with Ub especially lysines 45 and 50, rather than modifying the N-terminal amino group, which is instead \u03b1N-acetylated in cells. E2 depletion or Ub mutation inhibits TRIM5\u03b1 ubiquitination in cells and restores restricted viral reverse transcription, but not infection. Our data indicate that the stepwise formation of anchored Lys63-linked polyUb is a critical early step in the TRIM5\u03b1 restriction mechanism and identify the E2 Ub-conjugating cofactors involved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["restriction", "TRIM5\u03b1", "Ube2N", "Ube2W", "ubiquitin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Reverse Transcription", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938751194", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"36957623100": {"Name": "Fletcher A.", "AuthorID": "36957623100", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Division, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "14820007300": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "14820007300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre of Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "36868823600": {"Name": "Schaller T.", "AuthorID": "36868823600", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Virology, Goethe University Frankfurt"}, "7005453955": {"Name": "Towers G.", "AuthorID": "7005453955", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre of Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "25651347700": {"Name": "Christensen D.", "AuthorID": "25651347700", "AffiliationID": "60024978", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and HSC Core Facilities, University of Utah School of Medicine"}, "7403703932": {"Name": "Nelson C.", "AuthorID": "7403703932", "AffiliationID": "60024978", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and HSC Core Facilities, University of Utah School of Medicine"}, "7004120416": {"Name": "Sundquist W.", "AuthorID": "7004120416", "AffiliationID": "60024978", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and HSC Core Facilities, University of Utah School of Medicine"}, "36901078100": {"Name": "Lehner P.", "AuthorID": "36901078100", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
