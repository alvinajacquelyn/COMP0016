In this paper, we consider the closed embedded hypersurface \u2211 in the warped product manifold M = [0, r\u00af) \u00d7 N equipped with the metric g = dr 2 + \u03bb(r) 2 g N . We give some characterizations of slice {r} \u00d7 N by the condition that \u2211 has constant weighted higher-order mean curvatures (\u03bb\u2032) \u03b1 p k , or constant weighted higher-order mean curvature ratio (\u03bb\u2032) \u03b1 p k /p 1 , which generalize Brendle's [Constant mean curvature surfaces in warped product manifolds, Publ. Math. Inst. Hautes \u00c9tudes Sci. 117 (2013) 247-269] and Brendle-Eichmair's [Isoperimetric and Weingarten surfaces in the Schwarzschild manifold, J. Differential Geom. 94(3) (2013) 387-407] results. In particular, we show that the assumption convex of Brendle-Eichmair's result [Isoperimetric and Weingarten surfaces in the Schwarzschild manifold, J. Differential Geom. 94(3) (2013) 387-407] is unnecessary. Here p k is the kth normalized mean curvature of the hypersurface \u2211. As a special case, we also give some characterizations of geodesic spheres in \u211d n , \u210d n and S{double-struck} n , which generalize the classical Alexandrov-type results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elliptic point", "Star-shaped", "warped product manifold", "Weingarten hypersurface"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929378025", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"35491048300": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "35491048300", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University"}, "55963879800": {"Name": "Xiong C.", "AuthorID": "55963879800", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University"}, "55585780100": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "55585780100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
