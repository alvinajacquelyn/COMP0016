The truly repentant prodigal and posturing sinner are functionally identical on the early modern stage, and the parable was so renowned that the prodigal\u2019s repentance and forgiveness could not only be predicted, but expected and engineered. This essay compares prodigals\u2019 repentances across Eastward Ho, The London Prodigal, 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody, and the Henry IVs. It argues that these plays exhibit discomfort with the outward display of repentance, the irrelevance of sincerity, and the viability of the parable as a repentance narrative. While some of these repentances have been discussed in isolation, their comparison allows for the examination of ambiguous repentances not as isolated incidents but a discernible trend in early modern culture, born from anxieties regarding the indistinguishability of feigned and \u2018true\u2019 performances of inward spiritual change. The authenticity of repentance, it emerges, cannot be determined, but repentance also need not be sincere to be accepted by a plays\u2019 community. The authenticity of repentance proves not only impossible to identify, but ultimately irrelevant to these plays\u2019 social worlds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Parable", "Prodigal", "Repentance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052843237", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190219480": {"Name": "Horbury E.", "AuthorID": "57190219480", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University"}}}
