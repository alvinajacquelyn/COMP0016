To avoid selection biases, however, comparisons ideally involve all cell types present in a multicellular organism. Here, we use image registration and a newly developed \"Profiling by Signal Probability Mapping\" algorithm to generate a cellular resolution 3D expression atlas for an entire animal. We investigate three-segmented young worms of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, with a rich diversity of differentiated cells present in relatively low number. Starting from whole-mount expression images for close to 100 neural specification and differentiation genes, our atlas identifies and molecularly characterizes 605 bilateral pairs of neurons at specific locations in the ventral nerve cord. Among these pairs, we identify sets of neurons expressing similar combinations of transcription factors, located at spatially coherent anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and mediallateral coordinates that we interpret as cell types. Comparison with motor and interneuron types in the vertebrate neural tube indicates conserved combinations, for example, of cell types cospecified by Gata1/2/3 and Tal transcription factors. These include V2b interneurons and the central spinal fluid-contacting Kolmer-Agduhr cells in the vertebrates, and several neuron types in the intermediate ventral ganglionic mass in the annelid. We propose that Kolmer-Agduhr cell-like mechanosensory neurons formed part of the mucociliary sole in protostome-deuterostome ancestors and diversified independently into several neuron types in annelid and vertebrate descendants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell-type evolution", "Evo-devo", "Gene-expression atlas", "Kolmer-Agduhr cells", "ProSPr"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Body Patterning", "Cell Differentiation", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Models, Biological", "Neurons", "Polychaeta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020249237", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55968649000": {"Name": "Vergara H.M.", "AuthorID": "55968649000", "AffiliationID": "60007257", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory"}, "57188751829": {"Name": "Bertucci P.Y.", "AuthorID": "57188751829", "AffiliationID": "60007257", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory"}, "55396002000": {"Name": "Hantz P.", "AuthorID": "55396002000", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "55925006500": {"Name": "Tosches M.A.", "AuthorID": "55925006500", "AffiliationID": "60030881", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Brain Research"}, "55245942600": {"Name": "Achim K.", "AuthorID": "55245942600", "AffiliationID": "60007257", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory"}, "24451163600": {"Name": "Vopalensky P.", "AuthorID": "24451163600", "AffiliationID": "60000456", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics"}, "7003366390": {"Name": "Arendt D.", "AuthorID": "7003366390", "AffiliationID": "60007257", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory"}}}
