This lack of a common standard makes the rigorous comparison or combination of probes difficult. We show that the choice of biasing model has a significant impact on cosmological parameter constraints for a survey such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), considering the two-point correlations of galaxies in five tomographic redshift bins. We find that modelling galaxy bias with a free biasing parameter per redshift bin gives a Figure of Merit (FoM) for dark energy equation of state parameters w0, wa smaller by a factor of 10 than if a constant bias is assumed. An incorrect bias model will also cause a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters. Motivated by these points and focusing on the redshift evolution of linear bias, we propose the use of a generalized galaxy bias which encompasses a range of bias models from theory, observations and simulations, b(z) = c + (b0 - c)/D(z)\u03b1, where parameters c, b0 and \u03b1 depend on galaxy properties such as halo mass. For a DES-like galaxy survey, we find that this model gives an unbiased estimate of w0, wa with the same number or fewer nuisance parameters and a higher FoM than a simple b(z) model allowed to vary in z-bins. We show how the parameters of this model are correlated with cosmological parameters. We fit a range of bias models to two recent data sets, and conclude that this generalized parametrization is a sensible benchmark expression of galaxy bias on large scales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmological parameters - cosmology", "theory - dark energy - large-scale structure of universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925423029", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56514016600": {"Name": "Clerkin L.", "AuthorID": "56514016600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36188277700": {"Name": "Kirk D.", "AuthorID": "36188277700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005760971": {"Name": "Lahav O.", "AuthorID": "7005760971", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55944081300": {"Name": "Gazt\u00e3naga E.", "AuthorID": "55944081300", "AffiliationID": "60022558", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Ci'encies de lEspai (ICE, IEEC/CSIC)"}}}
