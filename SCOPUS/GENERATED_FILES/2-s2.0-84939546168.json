RCOM developments in primary and secondary care are described, with reference to measures currently in widespread use or likely to be implemented. Assessment procedure and completion rates are discussed. Some of the forces operating in this field are enumerated. Comparison is made with UK attempts at routine outcomes measurement in public education. This field is thus reviewed for lessons for RCOM, and opportunities and challenges considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Great Britain", "Humans", "Mental Health Services", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939546168", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7401581841": {"Name": "Macdonald A.", "AuthorID": "7401581841", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Trust Outcomes Team, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Maudsley Hospital"}, "8923645900": {"Name": "Fugard A.", "AuthorID": "8923645900", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University London"}}}
