In the present study, we have used magnetization, heat capacity, neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, and x-ray absorption measurements to investigate the nature of the Pr ion in x=0.1. The magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity of x=0.1 show a clear sign of the first-order valence phase transition below 175 K, where the Pr valence changes from 3+ to 4+. Neutron diffraction analysis reveals that x=0.1 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with space group P21/n at 300 K, but below 175 K two phases coexist, the monoclinic having the Pr ion in a 3+ valence state and a cubic one (Fm3\u0304m) having the Pr ion in a 4+ valence state. Clear evidence of an antiferromagnetic ordering of the Pr and Ru moments is found in the monoclinic phase of the x=0.1 compound below 110 K in the neutron diffraction measurements. Meanwhile, the cubic phase remains paramagnetic down to 2 K, a temperature below which heat capacity and susceptibility measurements reveal a ferromagnetic ordering. High energy inelastic neutron scattering data reveal well-defined high-energy magnetic excitations near 264 meV at temperatures below the valence transition. Low energy INS data show a broad magnetic excitation centered at 50 meV above the valence transition, but four well-defined magnetic excitations at 7 K. The high energy excitations are assigned to the Pr4+ ions in the cubic phase and the low energy excitations to the Pr3+ ions in the monoclinic phase. Further direct evidence of the Pr valence transition has been obtained from the x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results on the x=0.1 compound are compared with those for x=0 and 1.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiferromagnetic orderings", "Ferromagnetic orderings", "High-energy inelastic neutron scattering", "Low-energy excitations", "Monoclinic structures", "Neutron diffraction analysis", "Neutron diffraction measurements", "Susceptibility measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066409209", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"54909253700": {"Name": "Sannigrahi J.", "AuthorID": "54909253700", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}, "7005471548": {"Name": "Adroja D.T.", "AuthorID": "7005471548", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Highly Correlated Matter Research Group, Physics Department, University of Johannesburg"}, "56246111100": {"Name": "Kockelmann W.", "AuthorID": "56246111100", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}, "7102718125": {"Name": "Hillier A.D.", "AuthorID": "7102718125", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}, "7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}, "55561042800": {"Name": "Ritter C.", "AuthorID": "55561042800", "AffiliationID": "60007109", "AffiliationName": "Institut Laue Langevin"}, "7101618994": {"Name": "Boothroyd A.T.", "AuthorID": "7101618994", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}, "7004886742": {"Name": "Wakeshima M.", "AuthorID": "7004886742", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Hokkaido University School of Science, Chemistry Department"}, "7005330939": {"Name": "Hinatsu Y.", "AuthorID": "7005330939", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Hokkaido University School of Science, Chemistry Department"}, "7003565868": {"Name": "Mosselmans J.F.W.", "AuthorID": "7003565868", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7102377686": {"Name": "Ramos S.", "AuthorID": "7102377686", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}}}
