A pool of 97 items generated from interviews was reduced to 60 items following review. A piloting exercise provided evidence for the usability, readability and relevance of items and informed further adaptations resulting in the 51-item Paediatric Renal Caregiver Burden Scale. Further to assessment of its psychometric properties, it is hoped that that the Paediatric Renal Caregiver Burden Scale will serve as a useful measure of caregiver burden in paediatric chronic kidney disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregiver burden", "measure development", "paediatric chronic kidney disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Caregivers", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychometrics", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954453437", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"16319500200": {"Name": "Parham R.", "AuthorID": "16319500200", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Psychology, Department of Psychology, Politics and Sociology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "56997551700": {"Name": "Jacyna N.", "AuthorID": "56997551700", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Psychology, Department of Psychology, Politics and Sociology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "16316148100": {"Name": "Holttum S.", "AuthorID": "16316148100", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Psychology, Department of Psychology, Politics and Sociology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "35267762400": {"Name": "Camic P.", "AuthorID": "35267762400", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Psychology, Department of Psychology, Politics and Sociology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "13604772600": {"Name": "Hothi D.", "AuthorID": "13604772600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
