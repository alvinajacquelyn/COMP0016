In this regard, magnetic iron oxide/graphene oxide (MGO) nanocomposites were prepared by a simple and effective chemical co-precipitation method, followed by nucleation and growth of nanoparticles. The structure and morphology of MGO was identified by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy X-ray diffraction (XRD), Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. The interactive and main effect of parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, sonication time and concentration of DEP involved in the adsorption process were set within the ranges 3.0\u201311.0, 0.10\u20130.50 g L\u22121, 1\u20135 min, 5\u201310 mg/L, respectively. Root means square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), absolute average deviation (AAD), and coefficient of determination (R2) was employed to examine the applicability of the response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models for the description of experimental data. Compared to RSM, the ANN showed a more accurate performance for modeling the process of DEP adsorption. Using genetic algorithm-ANN, optimum conditions were set to 5.38, 334.7 mg/L, 3.723 min and 4.21 mg/L for pH, adsorbent dose, sonication time and concentration of DEP, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity and adsorption factors were 116.933 mg/g and 100%, respectively, while the relative standard deviations (RSDs) was <1.6% (N = 5). The isotherm models display that the Langmuir has the best fit with the equilibrium data, and adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamic results confirmed that the sorption was endothermic and occurred spontaneously. The results exhibited that MGO has excellent potential as an adsorbent for the removal of phthalates from the contaminated water.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial neural network", "DEP", "Magnetic graphene oxide", "Mathematical modeling", "Response surface methodology", "Ultrasonic assisted adsorption"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070191095", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"56366698100": {"Name": "Azari A.", "AuthorID": "56366698100", "AffiliationID": "60027708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "36243916100": {"Name": "Mahmoudian M.H.", "AuthorID": "36243916100", "AffiliationID": "60088054", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Qom University of Medical Sciences"}, "57196399238": {"Name": "Niari M.H.", "AuthorID": "57196399238", "AffiliationID": "60025497", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences"}, "56507330400": {"Name": "E\u015f I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas"}, "35084923200": {"Name": "Dehganifard E.", "AuthorID": "35084923200", "AffiliationID": "60122722, 60106549", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Health, Safety and Environment (RCHSE), Alborz University of Medical Sciences"}, "57193276423": {"Name": "Kiani A.", "AuthorID": "57193276423", "AffiliationID": "60022657", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, School of Public Health, Fasa University of Medical Sciences"}, "54381979400": {"Name": "Javid A.", "AuthorID": "54381979400", "AffiliationID": "60103657", "AffiliationName": "Environmental and Occupational Health Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences"}, "57210284275": {"Name": "Azari H.", "AuthorID": "57210284275", "AffiliationID": "60088054", "AffiliationName": "Qom University of Medical Sciences"}, "57195309551": {"Name": "Fakhri Y.", "AuthorID": "57195309551", "AffiliationID": "60018934", "AffiliationName": "Student Research Committee, Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}, "57203634349": {"Name": "Mousavi Khaneghah A.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}}}
