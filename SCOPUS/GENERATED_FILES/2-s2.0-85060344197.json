This study evaluates its use in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis (AL) before and after treatment as well as its serial utility in monitoring. Fifteen AL patients with cardiac involvement underwent 18 F-florbetapir PET imaging and three patients underwent repeat imaging after chemotherapy. All patients had demonstrable cardiac uptake with 18 F-florbetapir. Cardiac uptake appeared greater in chemotherapy-na\u00efve vs. chemotherapy-established AL patients median (left ventricular retention index 0.21 vs. 0.14 min \u22121 , respectively) and greater in patients that had not achieved at least a partial haematological response (left ventricular retention index 0.2 vs. 0.14 min \u22121 , respectively). There was no interval difference in cardiac uptake and no correlation in cardiac uptake with cardiac biomarkers or serum free light chains. This is the largest study of 18 F-florbetapir in patients with AL amyloidosis. It is the first study to include patients prior to starting chemotherapy and uniquely includes patients who underwent repeat imaging after chemotherapy. All patients had cardiac uptake with 18 F-florbetapir, regardless of haematological or NT-proBNP response to chemotherapy. There was a suggestion that treatment-na\u00efve patients may have higher cardiac uptake. Larger studies are required to establish the role of this tracer in screening patients with amyloidosis for cardiac involvement, discriminating between ATTR and AL amyloidosis, and in disease monitoring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AL", "Amyloidosis", "florbetapir", "imaging", "PET"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aniline Compounds", "Ethylene Glycols", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060344197", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"57196120999": {"Name": "Manwani R.", "AuthorID": "57196120999", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "41861760800": {"Name": "Lane T.", "AuthorID": "41861760800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "36647033100": {"Name": "Whelan C.", "AuthorID": "36647033100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "56701783400": {"Name": "Page J.", "AuthorID": "56701783400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55354235200": {"Name": "Skillen A.", "AuthorID": "55354235200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57202782066": {"Name": "Wagner T.", "AuthorID": "57202782066", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6602332136": {"Name": "Burniston M.", "AuthorID": "6602332136", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
