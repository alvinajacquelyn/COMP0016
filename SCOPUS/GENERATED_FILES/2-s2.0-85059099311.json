Companies have made efforts to mitigate the environmental impacts of packaging; however, plastic waste from packaging remains a big issue. This study builds a framework of factors that are important in helping companies reduce the amount of plastic in their packaging. The framework is based on findings from a literature review and five interviews with practitioners. The study found that to achieve a reduction of plastic in packaging, seven factors are imperative in the fuzzy-end stage of packaging design and development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Packaging", "Plastic usage", "Practitioners", "Sustainable design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Literature reviews", "Packaging designs", "Plastic packaging", "Plastic wastes", "Practitioners"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059099311", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57194044479": {"Name": "Ma X.", "AuthorID": "57194044479", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering, Institute for Manufacturing"}, "56099732900": {"Name": "Aranda-Jan C.", "AuthorID": "56099732900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering, Institute for Manufacturing"}, "6507681377": {"Name": "Moultrie J.", "AuthorID": "6507681377", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering, Institute for Manufacturing"}}}
