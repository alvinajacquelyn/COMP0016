However, the evidence base does not appear to support this and is of poor quality, focussing on population level outcomes, usually related only to participation in organised sports. A new approach to research into the effects of such events is required focussing on the processes and mechanisms by which population physical activity levels might be increased enabling more effective use of such events in the future. Two separate processes, the 'demonstration effect' and 'festival effect,' have been proposed in Government guidance and are explored using qualitative methods in eight inactive people and four physical activity promotion specialists in Brighton & Hove. The findings appear to support the idea that watching elite athletes compete is unlikely to inspire participation among inactive people and may even discourage it by reducing self-efficacy as a result of the perceived competence gap. Despite this, positive attitudes towards the London Olympics were observed among inactive members of the public and a desire to become actively involved in the event. Examples of intention to continue participating in community events and physical activities as a result of positive experiences of Olympic related events were also observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["physical activities", "qualitative methods", "sedentary behaviour", "sport"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Qualitative Research", "Sports"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940671183", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56814198100": {"Name": "Carter R.", "AuthorID": "56814198100", "AffiliationID": "60111024", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, Brighton and Hove City Council"}, "36147814900": {"Name": "Lorenc T.", "AuthorID": "36147814900", "AffiliationID": "115631103", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research"}}}
