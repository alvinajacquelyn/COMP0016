Methods We undertook a comparative policy analysis, based on informant interviews and documentation review of control of MTCT of syphilis and HIV, as well as nonparticipant observation of relevant meetings/trainings to investigate agenda-setting prior to 2010. Results We identified several factors contributing to the lower priority accorded to MTCT of syphilis: relative neglect at a global level, dearth of international financial and technical support, poorly unified national policy community with weak accountability mechanisms, insufficient understanding of the epidemic and policy options, and a prevailing negative framing of syphilis that resulted in significant stigmatization. Conclusion A dual elimination goal will only be reached when prioritization of MTCT of syphilis is enhanced in both the international and national agendas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agenda-setting", "China", "HIV", "Mother-to-child transmission", "Syphilis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "China", "Disease Eradication", "Female", "Health Policy", "Health Priorities", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Syphilis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931562058", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"56623633200": {"Name": "Wu D.", "AuthorID": "56623633200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7005237779": {"Name": "Hawkes S.", "AuthorID": "7005237779", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35899779000": {"Name": "Buse K.", "AuthorID": "35899779000", "AffiliationID": "60009752", "AffiliationName": "Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)"}}}
