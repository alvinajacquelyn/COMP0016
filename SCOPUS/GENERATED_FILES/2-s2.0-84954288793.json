This chapter has no such grand historical sweep, but focuses just on the last twenty years. Since the advent of the first Blair government in 1997 the United Kingdom has gone through an unprecedented period of constitutional change, which has seen the creation of important new conventions; modification of old conventions; codification of many conventions; and the demise of conventions rendered obsolete. So the United Kingdom\u2019s recent history is a test bed for the birth, death, evolution and codification of constitutional conventions. There have been so many changes to our conventions that coverage of each must necessarily be brief. The constitutional reforms can be divided into four successive waves, linked to the different prime ministers in charge. Blair's first government (1997-2001) introduced the first big tidal wave of reforms, with the creation in 1998 of devolved governments and legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; a directly enforceable bill of rights in the Human Rights Act 1998; and removal of the hereditary peers in 1999, leaving the House of Lords an almost entirely appointed House. His second government (2001-2005) introduced a second wave of judicial reforms in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, with the Lord Chief Justice replacing the Lord Chancellor as head of the judiciary, introduction of a Judicial Appointments Commission, and creation of the new Supreme Court, separate from the House of Lords.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954288793", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7003474647": {"Name": "Hazell R.", "AuthorID": "7003474647", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
