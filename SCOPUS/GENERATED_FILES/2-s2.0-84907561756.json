The total wave elevation and the total velocity potential are separated into two parts, based on the incoming wave from infinity and the disturbed potential by the body. The mesh is generated only once at the initial time and the element nodes are rearranged subsequently without changing their connectivity by using a spring analogy method. Through some auxiliary functions, the mutual dependence of fluid/structure motions are decoupled, which allows the body acceleration to be obtained without the knowledge of the pressure distribution. Numerical results are provided for forces and run-ups of a fixed cylinder with flare and the comparison is made with the second order theory in the frequency domain. Simulations are also made for a freely floating body responding to wave excitation. Resonance related to ringing excited by the high order force at the triple wave frequency is discussed. Further results are provided for motions, forces and run-ups of a floating cylinder with flare. Comparison with the results for the fixed body and body in single degree of freedom is made.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluid-structure interaction", "Freely floating body", "Fully nonlinear water wave theory", "Higher-order boundary element method", "Resonance at high-frequency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Floating bodies", "Fully nonlinear", "High frequency HF", "Higher-order boundary element methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907561756", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7401906874": {"Name": "Zhou B.Z.", "AuthorID": "7401906874", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Ship Building Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.X.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Ship Building Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "7006839535": {"Name": "Teng B.", "AuthorID": "7006839535", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60126533", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}}}
