Despite different initiating causes, they share a common final pathophysiology, the loss of the light sensitive photoreceptors. Replacement by transplantation may offer a potential treatment strategy for both patient populations. The last decade has seen remarkable progress in our ability to generate retinal cell types, including photoreceptors, from a variety of murine and human pluripotent stem cell sources. Driven in large part by the requirement for renewable cell sources, stem cells have emerged not only as a promising source of replacement photoreceptors but also to provide in vitro systems with which to study retinal development and disease processes and to test therapeutic agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blindness", "Cones", "Embryonic stem cells", "Induced pluripotential stem cells", "Photoreceptor cells", "Retina", "Retinal dystrophies", "Stem cells", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Retina", "Retinal Degeneration", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015729110", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57191409186": {"Name": "Aghaizu N.D.", "AuthorID": "57191409186", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55233580000": {"Name": "Kruczek K.", "AuthorID": "55233580000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "50261517000": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Cordero A.", "AuthorID": "50261517000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56275466000": {"Name": "Pearson R.A.", "AuthorID": "56275466000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
