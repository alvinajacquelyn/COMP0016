We examined the association between objectively assessed physical activity and brain volume, with a focus on the hippocampus region. Methods: We used data from UK Biobank (n = 5272; aged 55.4 \u00b1 7.5 years; 45.6% men) collected through 2013\u20132016. Participants wore the Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer for 7 days to assess habitual physical activity. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a standard Siemens Skyra 3T running VD13A SP4 to obtain images of the brain. Results: There was an association between physical activity (per SD increase) and grey matter volume after adjustment for a range of covariates, although this association was only detected in older adults (>60 years old). We also observed associations of physical activity with both left (B = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.01, 1.03; P = 0.046) and right hippocampal volume (B = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.08, 1.10; P = 0.024) in covariate-adjusted models. Conclusion: In summary, physical activity may play a role in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hippocampus", "neurodegeneration", "physical activity", "population"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Biological Specimen Banks", "Brain", "Correlation of Data", "Exercise", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Health Behavior", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Life Style", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Size", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053247373", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35249133300": {"Name": "Sharma N.", "AuthorID": "35249133300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}}}
