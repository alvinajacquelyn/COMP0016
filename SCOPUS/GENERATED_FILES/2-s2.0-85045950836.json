The technique is easy to implement, but places the previously not very well-defined concept of morphology on a firm mathematical foundation. The size distribution of the cold spots in 21-cm tomography can be used as a direct tracer of the underlying probability distribution of HII region sizes. We explore the capability of the method using large-scale reionization simulations and mock observational data cubes while considering capabilities of SquareKilometreArray 1 (SKA1) lowand a future extension to SKA2. We show that the technique allows the recovery of the HII region size distribution with a moderate signal-to-noise ratio from wide-field imaging (SNR \u2272 3), for which the statistical uncertainty is sample variance dominated. We address the observational requirements on the angular resolution, the field of view, and the thermal noise limit for a successful measurement. To achieve a full scientific return from 21-cm tomography and to exploit a synergy with 21-cm power spectra, we suggest an observing strategy using widefield imaging (several tens of square degrees) by an interferometric mosaicking/multibeam observation with additional intermediate baselines (~2-4 km) in an SKA phase 2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: theory", "Dark ages", "First stars", "Intergalactic medium", "Methods: data analysis", "Radiative transfer", "Reionization", "Techniques: image processing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045950836", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55413049700": {"Name": "Kakiichi K.", "AuthorID": "55413049700", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "6603692623": {"Name": "Ciardi B.", "AuthorID": "6603692623", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "57202095722": {"Name": "Busch P.", "AuthorID": "57202095722", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "25923933600": {"Name": "Majumdar S.", "AuthorID": "25923933600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College"}, "7004202562": {"Name": "Mellema G.", "AuthorID": "7004202562", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Oskar Klein Centre, AlbaNova, Stockholm University"}, "35185021700": {"Name": "Dixon K.L.", "AuthorID": "35185021700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Pevensey II Building, University of Sussex"}, "7005749078": {"Name": "Iliev I.T.", "AuthorID": "7005749078", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Pevensey II Building, University of Sussex"}, "24776325000": {"Name": "Jeli\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "24776325000", "AffiliationID": "60025529", "AffiliationName": "ASTRON, The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy"}, "7003603348": {"Name": "Zaroubi S.", "AuthorID": "7003603348", "AffiliationID": "60011173, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen"}, "7004666481": {"Name": "Koopmans L.V.E.", "AuthorID": "7004666481", "AffiliationID": "60011173, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen"}}}
