Polymer International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.Polymeric nanoparticles have important applications in drug delivery, biotechnology, diagnostics and energy harvesting. We report a new technique named electrospray nanoprecipitation, which combines electrospray with agitated solvent displacement. The process enables one-step formation of polymeric nanoparticles <100nm in size that are near-monodisperse with a diameter range significantly lower than could be obtained using either electrospray or agitated solvent displacement technique alone. Both reduction of polymer solution concentration and the addition of poly(vinyl alcohol) emulsifier in the water-non-solvent medium further reduce the average particle diameter. The technique provides an effective and straightforward method to further reduce the size range of near-monodisperse nanoparticles achievable in a single step, which can be readily adapted for reducing the achievable size range of core-shell structures using popular one-step encapsulation techniques such as coaxial electrospray.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrospray", "Nanoparticles", "Nanoprecipitation", "Polymethylsilsesquioxane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrosprays", "Monodisperse nanoparticles", "Nano precipitations", "One-step encapsulations", "Polymeric nanoparticles", "Polymethylsilsesquioxane", "Solution concentration", "Straight-forward method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921448333", "SubjectAreas": [["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"36523535000": {"Name": "Luo C.", "AuthorID": "36523535000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56489683300": {"Name": "Okubo T.", "AuthorID": "56489683300", "AffiliationID": "60075986", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Division, Third Patent Examination Department, Japan Patent Office"}, "6603377438": {"Name": "Nangrejo M.", "AuthorID": "6603377438", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
