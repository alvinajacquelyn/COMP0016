Trials that excluded PLWH were further investigated to evaluate if the exclusion was justified by scientific evidence.Results:We identified 56 multicentre open clinical trials in lymphoma including 46 interventional trials. People living with HIV were excluded from 32 interventional trials (70%). We identified a biologically valid reason (a potential increased risk of greater immunosuppression) for excluding PLWH from one trial and possibly for one optional arm in another study.Conclusions:There was no scientific or safety justification for excluding PLWH from most lymphoma clinical trials included on the NIHR portfolio. A clear justification for excluding PLWH was not offered in the available protocols. The exclusion of PLWH should be explicitly justified on scientific grounds in protocols to minimise stigmatisation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Drug Interactions", "Great Britain", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Lymphoma", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Patient Selection", "Refusal to Treat"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941877406", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56800647400": {"Name": "Venturelli S.", "AuthorID": "56800647400", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "56665480800": {"Name": "Stegmann K.", "AuthorID": "56665480800", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "55597282200": {"Name": "Pria A.D.", "AuthorID": "55597282200", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, National Centre for HIV Malignancies, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7007014065": {"Name": "Bower M.", "AuthorID": "7007014065", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, National Centre for HIV Malignancies, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "57202277642": {"Name": "Smith P.", "AuthorID": "57202277642", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Group Lead for Haematology and Brain Trials, Cancer Research UK, UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}}}
