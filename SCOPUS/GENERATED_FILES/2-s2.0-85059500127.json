Hyperactivation of numerous signaling pathways is hypothesized to promote renal epithelial cell hyperproliferation including mTORC1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and WNT signaling. \u03b2-catenin and its target genes are overexpressed in some PKD models and expression of activated \u03b2-catenin induces cysts in mice; however, \u03b2-catenin murine knockout studies indicate it may also inhibit cystogenesis. Therefore, it remains unclear whether \u03b2-catenin is pro-or anti-cystogenic and whether its role is canonical WNT signaling-dependent. Here, we investigate whether \u03b2-catenin deletion in a PKD model with hyperactived \u03b2-catenin signaling affects disease progression to address whether increased \u03b2-catenin drives PKD. We used renal epithelial cell specific Inpp5e-null PKD mice which we report exhibit increased \u03b2-catenin and target gene expression in the cystic kidneys. Surprisingly, co-deletion of \u03b2-catenin with Inpp5e in renal epithelial cells exacerbated polycystic kidney disease and renal failure compared to Inpp5e deletion alone, but did not normalize \u03b2-catenin target gene expression. \u03b2-catenin/Inpp5e double-knockout kidneys exhibited increased cyst initiation, cell proliferation and MEK/ERK signaling compared to Inpp5e-null, associated with increased fibrosis, which may collectively contribute to accelerated disease. Therefore, increased \u03b2-catenin and WNT target gene expression are not necessarily cyst promoting. Rather \u03b2-catenin may play a dual and context-dependent role in PKD and in the presence of other cyst-inducing mutations (Inpp5e-deletion); \u03b2-catenin loss may exacerbate disease in a WNT target gene-independent manner.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "beta Catenin", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Progression", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression", "Kidney", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Polycystic Kidney Diseases", "Signal Transduction", "Wnt Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059500127", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55323978500": {"Name": "Conduit S.E.", "AuthorID": "55323978500", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University"}, "26422171600": {"Name": "Hakim S.", "AuthorID": "26422171600", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University"}, "7004019110": {"Name": "Feeney S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004019110", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University"}, "7004364950": {"Name": "Ooms L.M.", "AuthorID": "7004364950", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University"}, "7005164505": {"Name": "Dyson J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005164505", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University"}, "7402387217": {"Name": "Mitchell C.A.", "AuthorID": "7402387217", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University"}, "6603364986": {"Name": "Abud H.E.", "AuthorID": "6603364986", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University"}}}
