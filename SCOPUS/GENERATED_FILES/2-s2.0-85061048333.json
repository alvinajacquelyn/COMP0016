Spontaneous PTB, resulting frompretermlabor, is commonly caused by intrauterine infection/ inflammation. Statins are well-established, cholesterol-lowering drugs that can reduce inflammation and inhibit vascular smooth muscle contraction. We show that simvastatin reduced the incidence of PTB in a validated intrauterine LPS-induced PTBmousemodel, decreased uterine proinflammatorymRNA concentrations (IL-6, Cxcl1, andCcl2), and reduced serumIL-6 concentration. Inhumanmyometrial cells, simvastatin reduced proinflammatory mediator mRNA and protein expression (IL-6 and IL-8) and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression (IL-10 and IL-13). Critically, simvastatin inhibited myometrial cell contraction, basally and during inflammation, and reduced phosphorylatedmyosin light chain concentration. Supplementationwithmevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate, abolished these anticontractile effects, indicating that theRho/Rho-associated protein kinase pathway is critically involved. Thus, simvastatin reduces PTB incidence in mice, inhibits myometrial contractions, and exhibits key anti-inflammatory effects, providing a rationale for investigation into the repurposing of statins to treat pretermlabor inwomen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contraction", "Inflammation", "Pregnancy", "Preterm birth", "Statins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticholesteremic Agents", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Repositioning", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Mice", "Muscle, Smooth", "Myometrium", "Obstetric Labor, Premature", "Pregnancy", "Signal Transduction", "Simvastatin", "Uterine Contraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061048333", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57185094500": {"Name": "Boyle A.K.", "AuthorID": "57185094500", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Reproductive Health"}, "51665754400": {"Name": "Rinaldi S.F.", "AuthorID": "51665754400", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Reproductive Health"}, "7402489769": {"Name": "Norman J.E.", "AuthorID": "7402489769", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Reproductive Health"}, "7403474508": {"Name": "Rossi A.G.", "AuthorID": "7403474508", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "35516023700": {"Name": "Saunders P.T.K.", "AuthorID": "35516023700", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}}}
