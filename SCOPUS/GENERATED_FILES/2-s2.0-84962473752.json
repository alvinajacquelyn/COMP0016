This paper proposed a cloud service platform, that targets wise transportation in order to carry out unified management and mining analysis of the huge number of the multivariate and heterogeneous dynamic transportation information, provides real-time transportation information, increases the utilization efficiency of transportation, promotes transportation management and service level of travel information, and provides decision support of transportation management by virtual reality as visual.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Passenger Flow Forecasting", "Virtual Geographical Environment", "Virtual Traffic", "WebVRGIS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Heterogeneous dynamics", "Passenger flows", "Real-time transportation", "Traffic analysis platforms", "Transportation management", "Utilization efficiency", "Virtual geographical environments", "WebVRGIS"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962473752", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56829171600": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56829171600", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology(SIAT), Chinese Academy of Science"}, "56828395700": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "56828395700", "AffiliationID": "60087824", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology(SIAT), Chinese Academy of Science"}, "35310707200": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "35310707200", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology(SIAT), Chinese Academy of Science"}, "55585973400": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "55585973400", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University"}}}
