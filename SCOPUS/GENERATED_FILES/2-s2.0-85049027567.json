These line lists cover rovibronic transitions between the eight lowest electronic states: X 1\u03a3g +, a3\u220fu, A1\u220fu, b3\u03a3g -, c3\u03a3u + d3\u220fg, B1\u0394g, and B' 1\u03a3g +. Potential energy curves (PECs) and transition dipole moment curves are computed on a large grid of geometries using the aug-cc-pwCVQZ-DK/MRCI level of theory including core and core-valence correlations and scalar relativistic energy corrections. The same level of theory is used to compute spin-orbit and electronic angular momentum couplings. The PECs and couplings are refined by fitting to the empirical (MARVEL) energies of 12C2 using the nuclear-motion program DUO. The transition dipole moment curves are represented as analytical functions to reduce the numerical noise when computing transition line strengths. Partition functions, full line lists, Land\u00e9-factors, and lifetimes for three main isotopologues of C2 (12C2, 13C2, and 12C13C) are made available in electronic form from the CDS (http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr) and ExoMol (www.exomol.com) data bases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "Molecular data", "Opacity", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Stars: low-mass"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049027567", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57204317980": {"Name": "Pyatenko E.", "AuthorID": "57204317980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57190172653": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3 I.", "AuthorID": "57190172653", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}}}
