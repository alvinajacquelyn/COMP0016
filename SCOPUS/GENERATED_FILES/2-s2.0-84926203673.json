Knowing the probability distribution of the number of customers in a queue is important for estimating the risk of stress or disruption to routine services and upstream blocking, potentially leading to exceeding critical limits, gridlock or incidents. The present paper focuses on time-varying queues produced by transient oversaturation during demand peaks where there is randomness in arrivals and service. The objective is to present practical methods for estimating a probability distribution from knowledge of the mean, variance and utilisation (degree of saturation) of a queue available from computationally efficient, if approximate, time-dependent calculation. This is made possible by a novel expression for time-dependent queue variance. The queue processes considered are those commonly used to represent isolated priority (M/M/1) and signal-like (M/D/1) systems, plus some statistical variations within the common Pollaczek-Khinchin framework. Results are verified by comparison with Markov simulation based on recurrence relations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamic", "probability distribution", "queue", "reliability", "uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climatic events", "Computationally efficient", "Degree of saturations", "Practical method", "queue", "Recurrence relations", "Statistical variations", "uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926203673", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"7201546414": {"Name": "Taylor N.", "AuthorID": "7201546414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "6701695159": {"Name": "Heydecker B.", "AuthorID": "6701695159", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
