This organization coordinates primary and specialized care with an IT infrastructure composed by multiple Electronic Health Record Systems. According to the large volume of healthcare professionals involved, there is a need for providing a consistent management of information through multiple locations and systems. The HEMIC project aims to address this need developing and validating a methodology based on a software tool for standardizing information contained within EHR systems. The developed tool has been designed for supporting the participation of healthcare professionals the establishment of mechanisms for information governance. This research presents the requirements and designs for of a software tool focused on the adoption of recognized best practice in clinical information modeling. The designed tool has a Service Oriented Architecture that will be able to integrate terminology servers and repositories of clinical information models as part of the modeling process. Moreover, the defined tool organizes clinicians, IT developers and terminology experts involved in the modeling process in three levels to promote their coordination in the definition, specialization and validation of clinical information models. In order to ensure the quality of the developed clinical information models, the defined tool is based on the requirements defined in the ISO13972 Technical Specification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic Health Record", "Quality Management System", "Semantic Interoperability", "Software", "Tool"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computer Systems", "Electronic Health Records", "Humans", "Medical Records Systems, Computerized", "Software", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018807123", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"55786129600": {"Name": "Moreno-Conde A.", "AuthorID": "55786129600", "AffiliationID": "60033284, 60103764", "AffiliationName": "Group of Research and Innovation in Biomedical Informatics, Biomedical Engineering and Health Economy.
