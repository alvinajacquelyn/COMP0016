Fifteen female patients (mean age = 21 years; standard deviation [SD] = 5.7; range: 15\u201333 years) with the diagnosis of AN of the restricting type (AN-r)\u2014according to the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition criteria\u2014underwent T1-weighted MRI at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 11 months (SD = 6.4). We used the brain boundary shift integral (BSI) and the ventricular BSI (VBSI) to estimate volume changes after registering voxels of follow-up onto baseline MRI. Very significant and strong correlations were found between BMI variation and the brain BSI, as well as between BMI variation and the VBSI. After adjustment for age at onset, duration of illness, and the BMI rate of change before baseline MRI, the statistical significance of both associations persisted. Registration-based methods on serial MRI represent an additional tool to estimate AN severity, because they provide measures of brain volume change strongly associated with BMI variation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Brain", "Changes", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "Registration-based methods", "Volume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Anorexia Nervosa", "Body Mass Index", "Brain", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Organ Size", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050746074", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57203162903": {"Name": "Santos M.", "AuthorID": "57203162903", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "University of Porto, Faculty of Medicine"}, "55581013500": {"Name": "Os\u00f3rio E.", "AuthorID": "55581013500", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Department of Psychiatry"}, "36943574400": {"Name": "Brand\u00e3o I.", "AuthorID": "36943574400", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Department of Psychiatry"}, "8679629100": {"Name": "Bastos-Leite A.", "AuthorID": "8679629100", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "University of Porto, Faculty of Medicine"}, "52664231300": {"Name": "Tim\u00f3teo S.", "AuthorID": "52664231300", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Department of Psychiatry"}, "13406648700": {"Name": "Roma-Torres A.", "AuthorID": "13406648700", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Department of Psychiatry"}, "55362668300": {"Name": "Finnegan S.", "AuthorID": "55362668300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Medical Image Computing"}}}
