However, the proteins that are involved in detoxification/efflux have not been completely resolved nor has the basis by which they select their metal substrate. Here, we compared six proteins, which were reported to be involved in manganese detoxification/ efflux, by evaluating their ability to reduce manganese toxicity in chicken DT40 cells, finding that human ZnT10 (hZnT10) was the most significant contributor.Adomain swapping and substitution analysis between hZnT10 and the zincspecific transporter hZnT1 showed that residue Asn43, which corresponds to the His residue constituting the potential intramembranous zinc coordination site in other ZnT transporters, is necessary to impart hZnT10's unique manganese mobilization activity; residues Cys52 and Leu242 in transmembrane domains II and V play a subtler role in controlling the metal specificity of hZnT10. Interestingly, the His3Asn reversion mutant in hZnT1 conferred manganese transport activity and loss of zinc transport activity. These results provide important information about manganese detoxification/efflux mechanisms in vertebrate cells as well as the molecular characterization of hZnT10 as a manganese transporter.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coordination sites", "Manganese toxicity", "Metal specificity", "Metal substrate", "Molecular characterization", "Trans-membrane domains", "Transport activity", "Vertebrate cells", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Cell Line", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Manganese", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978971402", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57190034717": {"Name": "Nishito Y.", "AuthorID": "57190034717", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Division of Integrated Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University"}, "55887270400": {"Name": "Tsuji N.", "AuthorID": "55887270400", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Division of Integrated Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University"}, "57190290850": {"Name": "Takeda T.A.", "AuthorID": "57190290850", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Division of Integrated Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University"}, "14036408900": {"Name": "Yamazaki T.", "AuthorID": "14036408900", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University"}, "50661983200": {"Name": "Teranishi F.", "AuthorID": "50661983200", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Division of Integrated Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University"}, "7102953212": {"Name": "Kambe T.", "AuthorID": "7102953212", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Division of Integrated Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University"}, "13407282000": {"Name": "Fujishiro H.", "AuthorID": "13407282000", "AffiliationID": "60033415", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University"}, "35514565600": {"Name": "Himeno S.", "AuthorID": "35514565600", "AffiliationID": "60033415", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University"}, "56115595100": {"Name": "Okazaki F.", "AuthorID": "56115595100", "AffiliationID": "60000202", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Agriculture, Ryukoku University"}, "57190155647": {"Name": "Matsunaga A.", "AuthorID": "57190155647", "AffiliationID": "60026243", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Kyoto Women's University"}, "56732542100": {"Name": "Narita H.", "AuthorID": "56732542100", "AffiliationID": "60026243", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Kyoto Women's University"}, "20436795800": {"Name": "Tuschl K.", "AuthorID": "20436795800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "55436966200": {"Name": "Rao R.", "AuthorID": "55436966200", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7201774111": {"Name": "Kono S.", "AuthorID": "7201774111", "AffiliationID": "60005684", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine"}, "7102348344": {"Name": "Miyajima H.", "AuthorID": "7102348344", "AffiliationID": "60005684", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine"}}}
