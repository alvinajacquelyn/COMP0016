All rights reserved.A new stabilization scheme, based on a stochastic representation of the discretized field variables, is proposed with a view to reduce or even eliminate unphysical oscillations in the mesh-free numerical simulations of systems developing shocks or exhibiting localized bands of extreme deformation in the response. The origin of the stabilization scheme may be traced to nonlinear stochastic filtering and, consistent with a class of such filters, gain-based additive correction terms are applied to the simulated solution of the system, herein achieved through the element-free Galerkin method, in order to impose a set of constraints that help arresting the spurious oscillations. The method is numerically illustrated through its applications to inviscid Burgers' equations, wherein shocks may develop as a result of intersections of the characteristics, and to a gradient plasticity model whose response is often characterized by a developing shear band as the external load is gradually increased. The potential of the method in stabilized yet accurate numerical simulations of such systems involving extreme gradient variations in the response is thus brought forth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constraints and innovations", "Gradient plasticity", "Shear band", "Shocks", "Spurious oscillations", "Stochastic stabilization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Element free Galerkin methods", "Gradient plasticity", "Shocks", "Spurious oscillations", "Stochastic representations", "Stochastic stabilization", "Strain localizations", "Unphysical oscillations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028129997", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"36904795500": {"Name": "Pimprikar N.", "AuthorID": "36904795500", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Computational Mechanics Lab, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "24725381700": {"Name": "Sarkar S.", "AuthorID": "24725381700", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Computational Mechanics Lab, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "16308860600": {"Name": "Devaraj G.", "AuthorID": "16308860600", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Computational Mechanics Lab, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "7402439420": {"Name": "Roy D.", "AuthorID": "7402439420", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Computational Mechanics Lab, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "7201777476": {"Name": "Reid S.R.", "AuthorID": "7201777476", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Universities of Manchester and Aberdeen"}}}
