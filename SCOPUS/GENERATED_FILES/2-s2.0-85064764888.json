Thus, TB remains the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, and new vaccine approaches are urgently needed. T-cells are important for protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but the optimal T-cell antigens to be included in new vaccines are not established. T-cells are often thought of as responding mainly to peptide antigens presented by polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II molecules. Over the past two decades, the number of non-peptidic Mtb derived antigens for \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells has expanded rapidly, creating broader perspectives about the types of molecules that could be targeted by T-cell-based vaccines against TB. Many of these non-peptide responsive T-cell subsets in humans are activated in a manner that is unrestricted by classical MHC-dependent antigen-presenting systems, but instead require essentially nonpolymorphic presentation systems. These systems are Cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1), MHC related protein 1 (MR1), butyrophilin 3A1, as well as the nonclassical MHC class Ib family member HLA-E. Thus, the resulting T-cell responses can be shared among a genetically diverse population, creating the concept of donor-unrestricted T-cells (DURTs). Here, we review evidence that DURTs are an abundant component of the human immune system and recognize many antigens expressed by Mtb, including antigens that are expressed in BCG and other candidate whole cell vaccines. Further, DURTs exhibit functional diversity and demonstrate the ability to control microbial infection in small animal models. Finally, we outline specific knowledge gaps and research priorities that must be addressed to realize the full potential of DURTs as part of new TB vaccines approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Donor-unrestricted T-cells", "Tetramers", "Tuberculosis", "Vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Antigens, CD1", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II", "Humans", "Mice", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Peptides", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "Tissue Donors", "Tuberculosis Vaccines", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064764888", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6601983679": {"Name": "Joosten S.A.", "AuthorID": "6601983679", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7005159872": {"Name": "Ottenhoff T.H.M.", "AuthorID": "7005159872", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "23469509300": {"Name": "Lewinsohn D.M.", "AuthorID": "23469509300", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University"}, "7004349140": {"Name": "Hoft D.F.", "AuthorID": "7004349140", "AffiliationID": "60028590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Saint Louis University"}, "56753636100": {"Name": "Moody D.B.", "AuthorID": "56753636100", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Harvard Medical School"}, "36191208900": {"Name": "Seshadri C.", "AuthorID": "36191208900", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research & Training Center, University of Washington"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
