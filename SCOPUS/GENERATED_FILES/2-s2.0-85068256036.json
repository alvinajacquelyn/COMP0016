Trials and reviews have focussed on physical gains in this population, often overlooking mental health outcomes. Objectives: To use a systematic review methodology guided by the PRISMA checklist to (1) investigate the effectiveness of psychological interventions for mental health difficulties in children and adolescents with medically unexplained symptoms and (2) identify aspects of interventions associated with their success. Methods: Randomised controlled studies investigating the impact of psychological interventions on mental health in children and adolescents with medically unexplained symptoms were included. Systematic searches of PsycINFO, MEDLINE and CINAHL were undertaken from inception to January 2018. Studies were appraised using the quality appraisal checklist. A qualitative synthesis of studies was completed. Results: In all, 18 studies were identified. Interventions targeting parental responses to illness and family communication appeared to have the best outcomes. Conclusions: Psychological interventions may be effective in improving mental health outcomes within this population; however, evidence for the efficacy of these interventions is limited due to a high risk of bias within the majority of reviewed studies. Future research using rigorous methodology and non\u2013cognitive behavioural therapy interventions is recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescent", "child", "Medically unexplained symptoms", "mental health", "paediatric", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Humans", "Medically Unexplained Symptoms", "Mental Health", "Psychotherapy", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Somatoform Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068256036", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57204925861": {"Name": "O\u2019Connell C.", "AuthorID": "57204925861", "AffiliationID": "114197696", "AffiliationName": "Kaleidoscope"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "36968589700": {"Name": "Bennett S.", "AuthorID": "36968589700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
