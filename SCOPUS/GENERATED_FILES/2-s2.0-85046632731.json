The Intercultural Learning Module is a one semester undergraduate course mostly attended by visiting study abroad students. The module aims to enhance students' intercultural awareness and skills through an interdisciplinary approach comprising Cultural Studies, Applied Linguistics, Anthropology, Psychology and Research Methods. Throughout the course students carry out an ethnographic project on a cultural topic of their choice, for which they are assessed. The principles and tools of ethnography are deeply embedded in the module content as a process of cultural observation and discovery. Over the past three years, students' feedback has been very positive and participant numbers have increased consistently. Four parallel classes (2 per semester) run per academic year. Resulting from the increasing popularity of the course and from the internationalisation strategy of the College, the MLC is currently offering a number of ad hoc training sessions on intercultural awareness and communication to different departments and members of the public. Training sessions differ from the module in depth and scope, but they are underpinned by the same reflection on intercultural theory and practical examples tailored to the audience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ethnography", "intercultural awareness", "intercultural training", "study abroad", "undergraduate module"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046632731", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57201991099": {"Name": "Colaiacomo S.", "AuthorID": "57201991099", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Modern Language Centre (MLC), King's College London"}, "57195543911": {"Name": "Puntil D.", "AuthorID": "57195543911", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Modern Language Centre (MLC), King's College London"}}}
