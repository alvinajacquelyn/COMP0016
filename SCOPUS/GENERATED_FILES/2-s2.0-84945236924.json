The first objective of this paper is to present a map that illustrates, for the first time, the real flow of casual cyclists and bike messengers in the city of Madrid. The second objective is to describe the development and results of the Madrid Cycle Track initiative, an online platform launched with the aim of collecting cycling routes and other information from volunteers. In the framework of this initiative, different online maps are presented and their functionalities described. Finally, a supplemental video visualizes the cyclist flow over the course of a day.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bike mobility", "cycle map", "Cycling", "GPS", "transport visualization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945236924", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"56922105100": {"Name": "Romanillos G.", "AuthorID": "56922105100", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "tGIS Transport, Infrastructure and Territory research group, Complutene University of Madrid, Ciudad Universitaria"}, "55847576000": {"Name": "Zaltz Austwick M.", "AuthorID": "55847576000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
