It is well known that DTI, although popular, is insufficient for describing complex fiber configurations that exist in the brain\u2014such as crossings, bendings and fannings. \u201cHigher order\u201dmodels have been proposed to overcome this limitation bymodelling crossings with greater accuracy and recent works have reported that up to 90% of white matter voxels contain crossings. However, since these models do not account for bending and fanning, i.e. dispersion, it is unknown if some fiber configurations are better explained by dispersion or by crossing (or by both). To address this problem, we take a model comparison approach on the publicly available state-of-the-art HCP dataset. We consider compartment based single fiber, crossing fiber and dispersion models, which are fitted to the data and ranked using several model selection and validation metrics, such as AIC, BIC and k-fold cross-validation. We generate maps of the brain based on these rankings which quantify the voxels where a single fiber or crossing or dispersion is the preferred model. The results show that 45\u201350% of the brain\u2019s parenchyma, including the white matter, are better explained by dispersion models, indicating the importance of modelling dispersion in addition to crossings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crossing fibers", "Dispersion models", "Fiber configuration", "Fiber dispersion", "K fold cross validations", "Model comparison", "Model Selection", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964066821", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36026494700": {"Name": "Ghosh A.", "AuthorID": "36026494700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
