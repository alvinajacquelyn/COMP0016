Here we show that ephrin type-B receptor 1 (EphB1) is upregulated in injured motor neurons, which in turn can activate astrocytes through ephrin-B1-mediated stimulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). Transcriptional analysis shows that EphB1 induces a protective and anti-inflammatory signature in astrocytes, partially linked to the STAT3 network. This is distinct from the response evoked by interleukin (IL)-6 that is known to induce both pro inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. Finally, we demonstrate that the EphB1-ephrin-B1 pathway is disrupted in human stem cell derived astrocyte and mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our work identifies an early neuronal help-me signal that activates a neuroprotective astrocytic response, which fails in ALS, and therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Astrocytes", "Axons", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Motor Neurons", "Neurons", "Neuroprotection", "Receptor, EphB1", "Sciatic Nerve", "Signal Transduction", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032486894", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54953367400": {"Name": "Tyzack G.E.", "AuthorID": "54953367400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57196275499": {"Name": "Cymes T.", "AuthorID": "57196275499", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "John Van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, E.D.
