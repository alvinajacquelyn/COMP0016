Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Neural tube closure is an important morphogenetic event that involves dramatic reshaping of both neural and non-neural tissues. Rho GTPases are key cytoskeletal regulators involved in cell motility and in several developmental processes, and are thus expected to play pivotal roles in neurulation. Here, we discuss 2 recent studies that shed light on the roles of distinct Rho GTPases in different tissues during neurulation. RhoA plays an essential role in regulating actomyosin dynamics in the neural epithelium of the elevating neural folds, while Rac1 is required for the formation of cell protrusions in the non-neural surface ectoderm during neural fold fusion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["actomyosin; Cdc42; cell protrusions; morphogenesis; mouse; neurulation; Rac1; RhoA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Humans", "Neural Tube", "rho GTP-Binding Proteins", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048247234", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"24725761200": {"Name": "Rolo A.", "AuthorID": "24725761200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "35558248500": {"Name": "Escuin S.", "AuthorID": "35558248500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
