For this reason, multiple systems have been developed to display charts in a digital or physical manner. Here, we introduce Floating Charts, a modular display that utilizes acoustic levitation for positioning free-floating objects. Multiple objects are individually levitated to compose a dynamic floating chart with the ability to move in real time to reflect changes in data. Floating objects can have different sizes and colours to represent extra information. Additionally, they can be levitated across other physical structures to improve depth perception. We present the system design, a technical evaluation and a catalogue of chart variations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic Levitation", "Charts", "Physical visualizations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic levitation", "Charts", "Graphical representations", "Multiple objects", "Multiple systems", "Physical structures", "Physical visualization", "Technical evaluation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974559438", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57015514400": {"Name": "Omirou T.", "AuthorID": "57015514400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "37006934700": {"Name": "Perez A.M.", "AuthorID": "37006934700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "12445160900": {"Name": "Roudaut A.", "AuthorID": "12445160900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex"}}}
