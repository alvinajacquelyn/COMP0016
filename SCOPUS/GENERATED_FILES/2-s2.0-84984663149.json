Was Durrington Walls the residence of the builders of Stonehenge? Were the activities there more significant than simply domestic subsistence? Using lipid residue analysis, this paper identifies the preferential use of certain pottery types for the preparation of particular food groups and differential consumption of dairy and meat products between monumental and domestic areas of the site. Supported by the analysis of faunal remains, the results suggest seasonal feasting and perhaps organised culinary unification of a diverse community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["feasting", "isotopic lipid residue analysis", "Neolithic", "public and private consumption", "Stonehenge", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984663149", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"7004388517": {"Name": "Craig O.E.", "AuthorID": "7004388517", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "BioArCh, Department of Archaeology, University of York"}, "25522881600": {"Name": "Shillito L.M.", "AuthorID": "25522881600", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of History, Classics and Archaeology, Armstrong Building, Newcastle University"}, "8267110000": {"Name": "Albarella U.", "AuthorID": "8267110000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Northgate House"}, "56397010400": {"Name": "Viner-Daniels S.", "AuthorID": "56397010400", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Northgate House"}, "57190030268": {"Name": "Chan B.", "AuthorID": "57190030268", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Artefact Studies, Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University"}, "57190034418": {"Name": "Simmons E.", "AuthorID": "57190034418", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Northgate House"}, "56396024100": {"Name": "Wright E.", "AuthorID": "56396024100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Northgate House"}, "22133509700": {"Name": "Cleal R.", "AuthorID": "22133509700", "AffiliationID": "113118520", "AffiliationName": "Alexander Keiller Museum"}, "6701500653": {"Name": "Ixer R.", "AuthorID": "6701500653", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "8836086000": {"Name": "Pearson M.P.", "AuthorID": "8836086000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "12752323700": {"Name": "Jay M.", "AuthorID": "12752323700", "AffiliationID": "60005807", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Department of Human Evolution"}, "57191071217": {"Name": "Marshall P.", "AuthorID": "57191071217", "AffiliationID": "60111436", "AffiliationName": "Historic England"}}}
