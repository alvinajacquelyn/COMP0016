As a result, substantial concerns have been raised about the future burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease that could ensue. The purpose of this review is to summarize and interpret (i) the evidence linking early life obesity with adverse changes in CV structure and function in childhood, (ii) the lifetime risk for CV disease resulting from obesity in childhood, and (iii) the potential effects of lifestyle interventions in childhood to ameliorate these risks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular risk", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adolescent", "Anthropometry", "Cardiomyopathies", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Child", "Forecasting", "Heart Atria", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Pediatric Obesity", "Risk Factors", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930794924", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"23059778200": {"Name": "Ayer J.", "AuthorID": "23059778200", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7005533405": {"Name": "Celermajer D.", "AuthorID": "7005533405", "AffiliationID": "60018150", "AffiliationName": "Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "8528765700": {"Name": "Charakida M.", "AuthorID": "8528765700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
