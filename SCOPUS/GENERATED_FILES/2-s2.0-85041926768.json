The web-based programme in this research focuses on word-level reading skills and targets blending and segmenting skills rather than whole word reading. This research, undertaken with 10 schools, explored whether a web-based PT programme would provide favourable implementation rates, and support the fidelity of the programme delivery. The study also measured the impact of the PT programme on word decoding and sight word reading using the Test of Word Reading Efficiency. Results suggest favourable implementation rates with 7 of the 10 schools implementing the programme. Full impact data for 34 children suggest that the programme has a positive impact on decoding (effect size 0.7) and sight word reading skills (effect size 0.6). A timed assessment provides evidence that fluency improved as well as accuracy. Gains were sustained at two-month follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["automaticity", "fidelity", "impact", "implementation rates", "Precision teaching", "word reading"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041926768", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57196917284": {"Name": "Hayes B.", "AuthorID": "57196917284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Educational Psychology Group"}, "57200614744": {"Name": "Heather A.", "AuthorID": "57200614744", "AffiliationID": "112233565", "AffiliationName": "Kent Educational Psychology Service, Maidstone"}, "55337848200": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "55337848200", "AffiliationID": "112233565", "AffiliationName": "Kent Educational Psychology Service, Maidstone"}, "57198873261": {"Name": "Clarke C.", "AuthorID": "57198873261", "AffiliationID": "112233565", "AffiliationName": "Kent Educational Psychology Service, Maidstone"}}}
