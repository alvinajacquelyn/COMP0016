While compression garments (CG) have been demonstrated to accelerate recovery, the literature is clouded by conflicting results and uncertainty over the optimal conditions of use. Objectives: A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of CG on the recovery of strength, power and endurance performance following an initial bout of resistance, running, or non-load-bearing endurance (metabolic) exercise. Methods: Change-score data were extracted from 23 peer-reviewed studies on healthy participants. Recovery was quantified by converting into standardized mean effect sizes (ES) [\u00b195% confidence interval (CI)]. The effects of time (0\u20132, 2\u20138, 24, >24 h), pressure (<15 vs. \u226515 mmHg) and training status (trained vs. untrained) were also assessed. Results: CG demonstrated small, very likely benefits [p < 0.001, ES = 0.38 (95% CI 0.25, 0.51)], which were not influenced by pressure (p = 0.06) or training status (p = 0.64). Strength recovery was subject to greater benefits than other outcomes [p < 0.001, ES = 0.62 (95% CI 0.39, 0.84)], displaying large, very likely benefits at 2\u20138 h [p < 0.001, ES = 1.14 (95% CI 0.72, 1.56)] and >24 h [p < 0.001, ES = 1.03 (95% CI 0.48, 1.57)]. Recovery from using CG was greatest following resistance exercise [p < 0.001, ES = 0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.61)], demonstrating the largest, very likely benefits at >24 h [p < 0.001, ES = 1.33 (95% CI 0.80, 1.85)]. Recovery from metabolic exercise (p = 0.01) was significant, although large, very likely benefits emerged only for cycling performance at 24 h post-exercise [p = 0.01, ES = 1.05 (95% CI 0.25, 1.85)]. Conclusion: The largest benefits resulting from CG were for strength recovery from 2 to 8 h and >24 h. Considering exercise modality, compression most effectively enhanced recovery from resistance exercise, particularly at time points >24 h. The use of CG would also be recommended to enhance next-day cycling performance. The benefits of CG in relation to applied pressures and participant training status are unclear and limited by the paucity of reported data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Athletes", "Clothing", "Exercise", "Humans", "Leg", "Muscle Strength", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Running", "Stockings, Compression"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018821290", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"57194141471": {"Name": "Brown F.", "AuthorID": "57194141471", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, St Mary\u2019s University College"}, "6701624552": {"Name": "Gissane C.", "AuthorID": "6701624552", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, St Mary\u2019s University College"}, "8502823700": {"Name": "Pedlar C.", "AuthorID": "8502823700", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, St Mary\u2019s University College"}, "7404772169": {"Name": "Hill J.", "AuthorID": "7404772169", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, St Mary\u2019s University College"}, "56017121400": {"Name": "Howatson G.", "AuthorID": "56017121400", "AffiliationID": "60029714", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Group, Northwest University"}, "6602639570": {"Name": "van Someren K.", "AuthorID": "6602639570", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GSK Human Performance Lab, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare"}}}
