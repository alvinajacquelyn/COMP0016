All rights reserved.Acknowledging language as an integral element of a sociocultural community highlights some sensitive areas in the realm of translation studies. Since the translator acts as a mediator between two unique cultures, the efficiency of cross-cultural interaction appears to be largely dependent on the quality of such intermediacy. The present paper aims to examine this culturally determined specificity of translation activity and consider lingua-cultural competence as a cornerstone of translators\u2019 performance. The authors also contemplate the opposition of \u2018accuracy\u2019 vs \u2018readability\u2019 as a stumbling block for translator\u2019s activity, and draw up a model of the lingua-cultural competence of translators specialising in intercultural business communication. Inferences made in the study rely on the data obtained from a questionnaire distributed among tutors and lecturers employed in higher educational institutions and involved in specialised translation training. The data collected were analysed based on statistical analysis that helped identify the importance of each separate skill incorporated in the lingua-cultural competence for the training of student translators specialising in intercultural business communication. This evidence was further utilised to elaborate on a set of methodological guidelines capable of developing the lingua-cultural competence of student translators specialising in intercultural business communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intercultural business communication", "Lingua-cultural competence", "Specialised translation", "Translation accuracy", "Translation equivalence", "Translation training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047429294", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56587911800": {"Name": "Malyuga E.N.", "AuthorID": "56587911800", "AffiliationID": "60015024", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics, Peoples\u2019 Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)"}, "53563800100": {"Name": "Krouglov A.", "AuthorID": "53563800100", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interpreting and Translation, Guildhall School of Business and Law, London Metropolitan University"}, "56587904000": {"Name": "Tomalin B.", "AuthorID": "56587904000", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Loughborough University"}}}
