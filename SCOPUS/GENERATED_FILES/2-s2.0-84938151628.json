Methods: Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of major health-care tobacco cessation interventions were used to derive efficacy estimates in terms of percentage-point increases relative to comparison conditions in 6-12-month continuous abstinence rates. This was combined with analysis and evidence from 'real world' studies to form a judgement on the probable effectiveness of each intervention in different settings. The affordability of each intervention was assessed for exemplar countries in each World Bank income category (low, lower middle, upper middle, high). Based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, an intervention was judged as affordable for a given income category if the estimated extra cost of saving a life-year was less than or equal to the per-capita gross domestic product for that category of country. Results: Brief advice from a health-care worker given opportunistically to smokers attending health-care services can promote smoking cessation, and is affordable for countries in all World Bank income categories (i.e. globally). Proactive telephone support, automated text messaging programmes and printed self-help materials can assist smokers wanting help with a quit attempt and are affordable globally. Multi-session, face-to-face behavioural support can increase quit success for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and is affordable in middle- and high-income countries. Nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, nortriptyline, varenicline and cytisine can all aid quitting smoking when given with at least some behavioural support; of these, cytisine and nortriptyline are affordable globally. Conclusions: Brief advice from a health-care worker, telephone helplines, automated text messaging, printed self-help materials, cytisine and nortriptyline are globally affordable health-care interventions to promote and assist smoking cessation. Evidence on smokeless tobacco cessation suggests that face-to-face behavioural support and varenicline can promote cessation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affordability", "Behavioural support", "Brief interventions", "Cytisine", "Effectiveness", "Efficacy", "Interventions", "NRT", "Smoking cessation", "Tobacco cessation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Health Planning Guidelines", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Use Disorder", "Treatment Outcome", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938151628", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "57207791753": {"Name": "Raw M.", "AuthorID": "57207791753", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham"}, "23977504000": {"Name": "Bitton J.", "AuthorID": "23977504000", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham"}, "35398346200": {"Name": "McNeill A.", "AuthorID": "35398346200", "AffiliationID": "60115380, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, National Addiction Centre"}, "7006172106": {"Name": "Stead L.", "AuthorID": "7006172106", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55073731400": {"Name": "Aveyard P.", "AuthorID": "55073731400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, University of Oxford"}, "16173167700": {"Name": "Stapleton J.", "AuthorID": "16173167700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Addiction Statistical Analysis, Addictions Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "55931074900": {"Name": "McRobbie H.", "AuthorID": "55931074900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Interventions, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "14048904600": {"Name": "Pokhrel S.", "AuthorID": "14048904600", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Group, Brunel University London"}, "56321454700": {"Name": "Lester-George A.", "AuthorID": "56321454700", "AffiliationID": "114775420", "AffiliationName": "LeLan Ltd"}, "7005900584": {"Name": "Borland R.", "AuthorID": "7005900584", "AffiliationID": "60001052", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Council Victoria"}}}
