This is mainly due to a lack of exact analytical expressions that can be used to rapidly predict the radiation properties of loaded nanoantennas. This paper will derive a set of useful analytical expressions for the far-field radiation properties of loop antennas loaded with an arbitrary number of lumped impedances that are valid from the RF-to-optical regimes. The analytical expressions will be validated with full-wave solvers and can be evaluated more than 100\u00d7 faster. The ability to perform such rapid evaluations enables, for the first time, large-scale single-objective and multi-objective optimizations. A series of optimizations reveal that electrically small superdirective antennas can be achieved at a variety of far-field angles through capacitive loading, paving the way for a pattern reconfigurable antenna. In addition, gains of greater than 3 dB can be achieved for electrically small antennas over a fractional bandwidth of 28%. Finally, it is shown that impedance loading can be used to achieve circularly polarized radiation from a single loop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antenna theory", "loop antennas", "nanotechnology", "optimization", "submillimeter-wave technology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical expressions", "Analytical formulation", "Antenna theory", "Circularly polarized radiations", "Electrically small antennas", "Fractional bandwidths", "Pattern reconfigurable antenna", "Submillimeter-wave technology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058875271", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"51564234000": {"Name": "Nagar J.", "AuthorID": "51564234000", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Electrical Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57200731245": {"Name": "Chaky R.", "AuthorID": "57200731245", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Electrical Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University"}, "55925714300": {"Name": "Werner D.", "AuthorID": "55925714300", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Electrical Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University"}, "6602185693": {"Name": "Pantoja M.", "AuthorID": "6602185693", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Electrical Engineering Department, University of Granada"}, "42661869600": {"Name": "McKinley A.", "AuthorID": "42661869600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
