The practical advantages of this visualization method are its rapid and simple implementation, with many potential applications including in characterising acoustic pumping within microfluidic channels. It also enables low-cost characterisation of IDT designs thereby allowing the determination of anisotropy and orientation of the piezoelectric substrate without the requirement for sophisticated and expensive equipment. Here, we show that the optical visibility of the sound path critically depends on the physical properties of the liquid film and identify heptane and methanol as most contrast rich solvents for visualization of SAW. We also provide a detailed theoretical description of this effect.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959332632", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55912945900": {"Name": "Rambach R.W.", "AuthorID": "55912945900", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Group, Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik i, Universit\u00e4t Augsburg"}, "57147978800": {"Name": "Taiber J.", "AuthorID": "57147978800", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Group, Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik i, Universit\u00e4t Augsburg"}, "57147905600": {"Name": "Scheck C.M.L.", "AuthorID": "57147905600", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Group, Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik i, Universit\u00e4t Augsburg"}, "57145969400": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "57145969400", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Group, Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik i, Universit\u00e4t Augsburg"}, "57210688367": {"Name": "Franke T.", "AuthorID": "57210688367", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
