They are often relied upon to recognize pain-related behaviours and report them, but little is known as to how they experience their role. Methods: Information was collected from 11 caregivers using semi-structured interviews about their experiences of caring for adults with intellectual disabilities who were suspected or definitely in pain. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Six superordinate themes were identified from participants' experiences: suffering in silence; searching for meaning to explain the complaint,; knowledge and skills needed to recognize and manage pain; perceptions of the pain experience; acting to try and reduce pain; and the emotional impact of pain. Conclusions: There seems an art to detect pain using existing skills and knowledge of the individual's ways of expressing pain. Despite best efforts, recognizing and treating pain was experienced as complex and ambiguous. Some caregivers described a negative emotional impact and dissatisfaction with the management of pain by health care services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Experience", "Intellectual disabilities", "Pain", "Parents", "Service user", "Staff"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Caregivers", "Female", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922978740", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56194677800": {"Name": "Findlay L.", "AuthorID": "56194677800", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Healthcare Team, Service for People who have a Learning Disability, South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Twinwoods Resource Centre"}, "23007289500": {"Name": "Williams A.C.d.C.", "AuthorID": "23007289500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7202092187": {"Name": "Baum S.", "AuthorID": "7202092187", "AffiliationID": "60170416", "AffiliationName": "Bromley Community Team for People with Learning Disabilities, Oxleas NHS Trust"}}}
