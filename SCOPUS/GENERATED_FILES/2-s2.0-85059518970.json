Previous studies have shown that room temperature synthesis of abiotic dolomite is rarely achieved and primary (proto-)dolomite precipitation is closely associated with microbial activities. In this study, we demonstrate through laboratory carbonation experiments that highly negative-charged clay minerals (as indicated by the values of zetal potential) such as illite and montmorillonite can aid the precipitation of abiotic proto-dolomite under ambient conditions, whereas nearly-neutral charged kaolinite exerts negligible influence on such process. In comparison to montmorillonite, illite has higher surface-charge density, thus is more effective in catalyzing proto-dolomite precipitation. Furthermore, the signal of proto-dolomite in carbonate neoformations is enhanced with increasing concentrations of illite or montmorillonite. On the basis of these results, we suggest that clay minerals catalyze dolomite formation perhaps via electrostatic binding of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ions and simultaneous desolvation of these strongly hydrated cations, a crucial step for dolomite crystallization. The resulting proto-dolomites display the morphologies, textures, and structures similar to those of biogenic dolomite reported before, which are considered precursors of ordered sedimentary dolomite. Therefore, our results offer a possible route to authigenic dolomite found in sedimentary environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catalytic effect", "Clay mineral", "Dolomite problem", "Laboratory synthesis", "Proto-dolomite"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059518970", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"35746319900": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "35746319900", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences"}, "57205318689": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57205318689", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, China University of Geosciences"}, "9638888200": {"Name": "Papineau D.", "AuthorID": "9638888200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Center for Planetary Sciences, University College London"}, "49964505800": {"Name": "Qiu X.", "AuthorID": "49964505800", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, China University of Geosciences"}, "35088891700": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "35088891700", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences"}, "16320264500": {"Name": "Yu N.", "AuthorID": "16320264500", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences"}, "57205321570": {"Name": "Fan Q.", "AuthorID": "57205321570", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences"}}}
