However, supersaturated drug generated by SSEDDS is thermodynamically unstable and tends to precipitate rapidly prior to absorption, resulting in compromised bioavailability. The aim of this study was to construct a novel supersaturated SSEDDS (super-SSEDDS) by combining SSEDDS with appropriate precipitation inhibitor. Fenofibrate (FNB), a sparingly soluble drug, was selected as a model drug in this study. An optimized SSEDDS was prepared by solvent evaporation by using mesoporous silica Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 as the inert carrier. Supersaturation assay was conducted to evaluate the precipitation inhibition capacity of different polymers, and the results showed that Soluplus\u00ae could retard the FNB precipitation more effectively and sustain a higher apparent concentration for ~120 min. This effect was also clearly observed in the dissolution profiles of FNB from SSEDDS under supersaturated condition. The study of the mechanism suggested that the inhibition effect might be achieved both thermodynamically and kinetically. The area under the concentration-time curve of the super-SSEDDS was 1.4-fold greater than that of SSEDDS in the absence of Soluplus, based on an in vivo pharmacokinetic study conducted in beagle dogs. This study has demonstrated that the approach of combining SSEDDS with Soluplus as a supersaturation stabilizer constitutes a potential tool to improve the absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fenofibrate", "Mesoporous silica", "Poorly water-soluble drugs", "Soluplus", "Supersaturation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Availability", "Caco-2 Cells", "Dogs", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Emulsions", "Fenofibrate", "Humans", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Polymers", "Polyvinyls", "Silicon Dioxide", "Solubility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038221453", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"54957604700": {"Name": "Quan G.", "AuthorID": "54957604700", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57192405428": {"Name": "Niu B.", "AuthorID": "57192405428", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57203486696": {"Name": "Singh V.", "AuthorID": "57203486696", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57195609888": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "57195609888", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "41862218500": {"Name": "Pan X.", "AuthorID": "41862218500", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55792196100": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "55792196100", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "8057139600": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "8057139600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Surrey"}}}
