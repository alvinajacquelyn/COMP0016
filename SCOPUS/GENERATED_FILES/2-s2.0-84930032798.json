Developmental Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The ability to navigate new environments has a significant impact on the daily life and independence of people with learning difficulties. The aims of this study were to investigate the development of route learning in Down syndrome (N = 50), Williams syndrome (N = 19), and typically developing children between 5 and 11 years old (N = 108); to investigate use of landmarks; and to relate cognitive functions to route-learning ability in these groups. Overall, measures of attention and long-term memory were strongly associated with route learning, even once non-verbal ability was controlled for. All of the groups, including 5- to 6-year-old TD children, demonstrated the ability to make use of all landmark types to aid route learning; those near junctions, those further from junctions, and also distant landmarks (e.g. church spire, radio mast). Individuals with WS performed better than a matched subset of TD children on more difficult routes; we suggest that this is supported by relatively strong visual feature recognition in the disorder. Participants with DS who had relatively high levels of non-verbal ability performed at a similar level to TD participants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cognition Disorders", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Learning Disorders", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Neuropsychological Tests", "User-Computer Interface", "Williams Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930032798", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"8301711500": {"Name": "Purser H.R.M.", "AuthorID": "8301711500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "6602319057": {"Name": "Farran E.K.", "AuthorID": "6602319057", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "22034531800": {"Name": "Courbois Y.", "AuthorID": "22034531800", "AffiliationID": "60107872, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire PSITEC (EA 4072), UDL3, Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France"}, "55315504500": {"Name": "Lemahieu A.", "AuthorID": "55315504500", "AffiliationID": "60107872, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire PSITEC (EA 4072), UDL3, Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France"}, "6602308496": {"Name": "Sockeel P.", "AuthorID": "6602308496", "AffiliationID": "60107872, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire PSITEC (EA 4072), UDL3, Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France"}, "56044013800": {"Name": "Mellier D.", "AuthorID": "56044013800", "AffiliationID": "60122778, 60032922", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire PSY-NCA (EA 4306), Universit\u00e9 de Rouen"}, "7006826263": {"Name": "Blades M.", "AuthorID": "7006826263", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield"}}}
