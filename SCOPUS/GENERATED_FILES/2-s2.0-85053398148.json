As part of a larger study of integrated working between the NHS and care homes we asked older people how they accessed health care services. Our aim was to understand how older people resident in care homes access health services using the Andersen model of health care access. Methods: Case studies were conducted in six care homes with different socio-economic characteristics, size and ownership in three study sites. Residents in all care homes with capacity to participate were eligible for the study. Interviews explored how residents accessed NHS professionals. The Andersen model of health seeking behaviour was our analytic framework. Findings: Thirty-five participants were interviewed with an average of 4 different conditions. Expectations of their health and the effectiveness of services to mitigate their problems were low. Enabling factors were the use of intermediaries (usually staff, but also relatives) to seek access. Residents expected that care home staff would monitor changes in their health and seek appropriate help unprompted. Conclusions: Care home residents may normalise their health care needs and frame services as unable to remediate these which may combine to disincline older care home residents to seek care. Care access was enabled using intermediaries -either staff or relatives-and the expectation that staff would proactively seek care when they observed new/changed needs. Residents may over-estimate the health-related knowledge of care home staff and their ability to initiate referrals to NHS professionals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Care homes", "General practice", "Health service access", "Secondary data analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Status", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Nursing Homes", "Primary Health Care", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053398148", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"21647459300": {"Name": "Victor C.", "AuthorID": "21647459300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University London"}, "15753794000": {"Name": "Masey H.", "AuthorID": "15753794000", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University London"}, "57198502507": {"Name": "Davies S.", "AuthorID": "57198502507", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire"}, "23004243200": {"Name": "Dickinson A.", "AuthorID": "23004243200", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire"}, "7202267987": {"Name": "Goodman C.", "AuthorID": "7202267987", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire"}, "6504476480": {"Name": "Morbey H.", "AuthorID": "6504476480", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster University"}, "57207551501": {"Name": "Froggatt K.", "AuthorID": "57207551501", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster University"}, "55293721200": {"Name": "Gage H.", "AuthorID": "55293721200", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
