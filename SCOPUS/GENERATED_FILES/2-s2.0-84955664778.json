The authors interpreted their finding as evidence in favor of the bivariate signal-detection model, but against the two-high-threshold model of item/source memory. According to the latter, new responses only follow from the state of old-new uncertainty for which no source discrimination is possible, and the probability of entering this state is independent of the old-new response bias. However, when missed old items were presented for source discrimination, the participants could infer that the items had been previously studied. To test whether this implicit feedback led to second retrieval attempts and thus to source memory for presumably unrecognized items, we replicated Starns et al.\u2019s (Memory & Cognition, 36, 1\u20138 2008) finding and compared their procedure to a procedure without such feedback. Our results challenge the conclusion to abandon discrete processing in source memory; source memory for unrecognized items is probably an artifact of the procedure, by which implicit feedback prompts participants to reconsider their recognition judgment when asked to rate the source of old items in the absence of item memory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayes factor", "Recognition", "Signal detection theory", "Source memory", "Threshold models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Feedback, Psychological", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Signal Detection, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955664778", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"56845813200": {"Name": "Malejka S.", "AuthorID": "56845813200", "AffiliationID": "60006341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Mannheim"}, "7006812512": {"Name": "Br\u00f6der A.", "AuthorID": "7006812512", "AffiliationID": "60006341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Mannheim"}}}
