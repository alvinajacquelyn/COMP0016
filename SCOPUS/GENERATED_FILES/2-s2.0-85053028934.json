Despite the presence of these cells in the adult human retina, there is no evidence of regeneration occurring in humans following disease or injury. It may be possible that factors present in the degenerated retina could prevent human M\u00fcller glia from proliferating and neurally differentiating within the diseased retina. On this basis, investigations into the proteomic profile of these cells and the abundance of key proteins associated to M\u00fcller glia in the gliotic PVR retina, may assist in the identification of factors with the potential to control M\u00fcller proliferation and neural differentiation in vivo. Label free mass spectrometry identified 1527 proteins in M\u00fcller glial cell preparations, 1631 proteins in normal retina and 1074 in gliotic PVR retina. Compared to normal retina, 28 proteins were upregulated and 196 proteins downregulated by 2-fold or more in the gliotic PVR retina. As determined by comparative proteomic analyses, of the proteins highly upregulated in the gliotic PVR retina, the most highly abundant proteins in M\u00fcller cell lysates included vimentin, GFAP, polyubiquitin and HSP90a. The observations that proteins highly upregulated in the gliotic retina constitute major proteins expressed by M\u00fcller glia provide the basis for further studies into mechanisms that regulate their production. In addition investigations aimed at controlling the expression of these proteins may aid in the identification of factors that could potentially promote endogenous regeneration of the adult human retina after disease or injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["M\u00fcller glia", "Proteomics", "Retina degeneration", "Retinal gliosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Blotting, Western", "Cells, Cultured", "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Gliosis", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neuroglia", "Proteomics", "Retina", "Retinal Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053028934", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"54787676900": {"Name": "Eastlake K.", "AuthorID": "54787676900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55622180600": {"Name": "Banerjee P.", "AuthorID": "55622180600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003299563": {"Name": "Charteris D.", "AuthorID": "7003299563", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56785711800": {"Name": "Limb G.A.", "AuthorID": "56785711800", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56458521200": {"Name": "Heywood W.E.", "AuthorID": "56458521200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56989017700": {"Name": "Bliss E.", "AuthorID": "56989017700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7202875406": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875406", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
