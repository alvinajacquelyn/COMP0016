The complexity to obtain an optimal solution using traditional uncertainty management methods dramatically increases with the number of uncertain factors considered. Such a complexity produces that, if tractable, the problem is solved after a large computational effort. Therefore, in this work a data-driven decision-making framework is proposed to address this issue. Such a framework exploits machine learning techniques to efficiently approximate the optimal management decisions considering a set of uncertain parameters that continuously influence the process behavior as an input. A design of computer experiments technique is used in order to combine these parameters and produce a matrix of representative information. These data are used to optimize the deterministic multi-objective bio-based energy network problem through conventional optimization methods, leading to a detailed (but elementary) map of the optimal management decisions based on the uncertain parameters. Afterwards, the detailed data-driven relations are described/identified using an Ordinary Kriging meta-model. The result exhibits a very high accuracy of the parametric meta-models for predicting the optimal decision variables in comparison with the traditional stochastic approach. Besides, and more importantly, a dramatic reduction of the computational effort required to obtain these optimal values in response to the change of the uncertain parameters is achieved. Thus the use of the proposed data-driven decision tool promotes a time-effective optimal decision making, which represents a step forward to use data-driven strategy in large-scale/complex industrial problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data-driven decision-support", "Kriging metamodeling", "Multiparametric programming", "Optimization under uncertainty", "Supply chain management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conventional optimization", "Data driven decision", "Design of computer experiments", "Machine learning techniques", "Metamodeling", "Multi-parametric programming", "Optimization under uncertainty", "Parametric uncertainties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059683531", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57202379120": {"Name": "Medina-Gonz\u00e1lez S.", "AuthorID": "57202379120", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Departament of Chemical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, EEBE"}, "55668476800": {"Name": "Shokry A.", "AuthorID": "55668476800", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Energy Department, Politecnico di Milano"}, "55263577300": {"Name": "Silvente J.", "AuthorID": "55263577300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202785730": {"Name": "Lupera G.", "AuthorID": "57202785730", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Departament of Chemical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, EEBE"}, "56866527000": {"Name": "Espu\u00f1a A.", "AuthorID": "56866527000", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Departament of Chemical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, EEBE"}}}
