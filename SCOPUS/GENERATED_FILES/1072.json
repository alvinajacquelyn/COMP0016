The degree of multifractality displayed by different stocks is found to be positively correlated to their depth in the hierarchy of cross-correlations. We propose a dynamical model that reproduces this observation along with an array of other empirical properties. The structure of this model is such that the hierarchical structure of heterogeneous risks plays a crucial role in the time evolution of the correlation matrix, providing an interpretation to the mechanism behind the interplay between cross-correlation and multifractality in financial markets, where the degree of multifractality of stocks is associated to their hierarchical positioning in the cross-correlation structure. Empirical observations reported in this paper present a new perspective towards the merging of univariate multi scaling and multivariate cross-correlation properties of financial time series.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84898720003", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54965530400": {"Name": "Morales R.", "AuthorID": "54965530400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, King's College London, Strand"}, "57190392609": {"Name": "Di Matteo T.", "AuthorID": "57190392609", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, King's College London, Strand"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics"}}}
