However, there has been a relative scarcity of attention to the rationales, rhetorics and discourses underpinning the academies programme. Seeking to address this gap, a poststructuralist discourse analytic lens is applied to 63 written submissions to the Academies Commission from a range of stakeholder groups, in order to map the different discourses and narratives drawn on in relation to academies and academisation. In setting out the various discourses identified, a cluster of discourses and rhetorical devices that produce the British education system as \u2018in crisis\u2019 are given especial attention. It is argued that these discourses provide the rationale and legitimisation for radical policy intervention as exemplified by the academies programme. The findings also provoke discussion concerning potential subjective agency in the promotion or otherwise of particular narratives and \u2018conceptual emblems\u2019 that inform the field of educational policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academies", "discourse", "education policy", "rhetoric", "schooling system", "schools", "standards"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927799222", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"7102276052": {"Name": "Francis B.", "AuthorID": "7102276052", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education and Professional Studies, King's College London"}}}
