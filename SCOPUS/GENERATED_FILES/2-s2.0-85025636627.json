All rights reserved.Background More than 1000 new patients present to the London Sarcoma Unit each year and between 5% and 10% require plastic surgery intervention. Advancements in radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocols combined with higher expectations for limb preservation has led to increased reconstructive challenges. Frequently, primary closure is achievable; however, larger tumors often require specialist reconstruction. Study Design A retrospective chart review of all referred patients from the London Sarcoma Unit requiring reconstruction between February 2006 and January 2015 was performed. Patients who underwent primary amputation were excluded. Results The total number of operations performed was 298 and the mean follow-up was 16 months (12-46 months). 51% of patients had major comorbidities. Patients could be separated into early (0-1 week postoperatively, n = 167) and late reconstructions (>1 week postoperatively, n = 131). 32 patients were reconstructed with skin grafts, 137 patients were managed with regional flaps and 129 patients were treated with free flaps. Conclusions A patient with 3 or more major comorbidities resulted in a significantly increased risk of reconstructive failure (P < 0.05). Our experience has lead us to adhere to the following guidelines: (1) All patients should be reviewed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. (2) After primary excision, patients should be managed with a vacuum dressing until margins are clear. (3) Definitive reconstruction should be performed by a specialist reconstructive surgeon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["microsurgery", "plastic surgery", "reconstructive surgery", "sarcoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bone Neoplasms", "Child", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physician's Role", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Retrospective Studies", "Sarcoma", "Skin Transplantation", "Soft Tissue Neoplasms", "Surgeons", "Surgical Flaps", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025636627", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"55346428400": {"Name": "Leckenby J.I.", "AuthorID": "55346428400", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free Foundation Trust"}, "15851075100": {"Name": "Grobbelaar A.O.", "AuthorID": "15851075100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free Foundation Trust"}, "57195130749": {"Name": "Deegan R.", "AuthorID": "57195130749", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
