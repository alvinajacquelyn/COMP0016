Symptoms are observed initially in the extremities, such as hands and arms, while advanced stages of the disease can effect blinking, swallowing, speaking, and breathing. PD is a neurodegenerative disease, with dopaminergic neuronal loss occurring in the substantia nigra pars compacta, thus disrupting basal ganglia functions. This leads to downstream effects on other neurotransmitter systems such as glutamate, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, and serotonin. To date, one of the main treatments for PD is levodopa. While it is generally very effective, prolonged treatments lead to levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). LID encompasses a family of symptoms ranging from uncontrolled repetitive movements to sustained muscle contractions. In many cases, the symptoms of LID can cause more grief than PD itself. The purpose of this review is to discuss the possible clinical features, cognitive correlates, neural substrates, as well as potential psychopharmacological and surgical (including nondopaminergic and deep brain stimulation) treatments of LID.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep brain stimulation (DBS)", "dopamine", "levodopa-induced dyskinesia", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antiparkinson Agents", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dopamine", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Parkinson Disease", "Serotonin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991311794", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56875918400": {"Name": "Moustafa A.A.", "AuthorID": "56875918400", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences and Psychology, Marcs Institute for Brain and Behaviour, Western Sydney University"}, "56431786400": {"Name": "Phillips J.R.", "AuthorID": "56431786400", "AffiliationID": "60017803", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences and Psychology, Western Sydney University"}, "55587507800": {"Name": "Eissa A.M.", "AuthorID": "55587507800", "AffiliationID": "60015323", "AffiliationName": "Psychogeriatric Research Center, Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"}, "35763545300": {"Name": "Hewedi D.H.", "AuthorID": "35763545300", "AffiliationID": "60015323", "AffiliationName": "Psychogeriatric Research Center, Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Motor Neuroscience Group, Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55571789800": {"Name": "El-Gamal M.", "AuthorID": "55571789800", "AffiliationID": "60012022", "AffiliationName": "Toxicology Department, Medical Experimental Research Center (MERC), Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University"}, "26643540300": {"Name": "Keri S.", "AuthorID": "26643540300", "AffiliationID": "60030035", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics"}}}
