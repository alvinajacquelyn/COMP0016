Objectives We sought to determine factors associated with FENO and whether FENO levels are associated with increased rates of acute chest syndrome (ACS) and pain. Methods All participants had SCA, were part of the prospective observational Sleep and Asthma Cohort study, and had the following assessments: FENO levels, spirometry, blood samples analyzed for hemoglobin, white blood cell counts, eosinophil counts and total serum IgE levels, questionnaires about child medical and family history, and review of medical records. Results The analytic sample included 131 children with SCA (median age, 11.2 years; age range, 6-18 years) followed for a mean of 16.2 years, including a mean of 5.1 years after baseline FENO data measurements. In multivariable analyses higher FENO levels were associated with ln(IgE) levels (P < .001) and the highest quartile of peripheral eosinophil counts (P = .03) but not wheezing symptoms, baseline spirometric indices, or response to bronchodilator. Multivariable analyses identified that the incident rate of ACS was associated with ln(FENO) levels (P = .03), as well as male sex (P = .025), wheezing causing shortness of breath (P = .002), and ACS at less than 4 years of age (P < .001). FENO levels were not associated with future pain episodes. Conclusions Steady-state FENO levels were not associated with an asthma diagnosis, wheezing symptoms, lung function measures, or prior sickle cell morbidity but were associated with markers of atopy and increased risk of future ACS events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute chest syndrome", "airway inflammation", "asthma", "exhaled nitric oxide", "Sickle cell disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Allergens", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Asthma", "Breath Tests", "Child", "Exhalation", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Male", "Nitric Oxide", "Skin Tests", "Spirometry", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994887784", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7404158096": {"Name": "Cohen R.T.", "AuthorID": "7404158096", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "55894420300": {"Name": "Rodeghier M.", "AuthorID": "55894420300", "AffiliationID": "112797457", "AffiliationName": "Rodeghier Consultants"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "55521823400": {"Name": "Rosen C.L.", "AuthorID": "55521823400", "AffiliationID": "60006404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"}, "57205934792": {"Name": "Kirkby J.", "AuthorID": "57205934792", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Portex Respiratory Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "36785164900": {"Name": "DeBaun M.R.", "AuthorID": "36785164900", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "7006404298": {"Name": "Strunk R.C.", "AuthorID": "7006404298", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine"}}}
