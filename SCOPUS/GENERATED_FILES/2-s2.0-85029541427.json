The ubiquitous presence of fatty acids in animal fats and plant oils precludes identification of fat types by the solely molecular composition of residues. Hence, animal fats are identified by determining their fatty acyl lipid distributions and stable carbon (\u03b413C) values allowing distinctions to be drawn between non-ruminant and ruminant, and dairy and adipose fats. The \u039413C proxy (= \u03b413C18:0 - \u03b413C16:0) originally proposed in the 1990s by Evershed and co-workers was based on modern reference fats sampled from animals raised in Britain on C3 plant diets. Further analyses on adipose and dairy fats from ruminants grazing in a wide range of isoscapes have shown that the \u039413C proxy can be applied in mixed C3/C4 environments, such as in Africa. Here we show, however, through the investigation of milk fats, how the \u039413C proxy can be perturbed when animals are reared on modern diets, specifically maize silage. It is thus shown that extreme care has to be taken when choosing modern reference fats for archaeological studies, and especially that insecurely sourced animal fats should be excluded from such databases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal fats", "Dairy fats", "Lipid residue analyses", "Modern reference materials", "Silage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029541427", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"55963668400": {"Name": "Roffet-Salque M.", "AuthorID": "55963668400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Organic Geochemistry Unit, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "7005538923": {"Name": "Evershed R.", "AuthorID": "7005538923", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Organic Geochemistry Unit, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "55635045000": {"Name": "Lee M.", "AuthorID": "55635045000", "AffiliationID": "60002793", "AffiliationName": "Rothamsted Research"}, "55875310400": {"Name": "Timpson A.", "AuthorID": "55875310400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
