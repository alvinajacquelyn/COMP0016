At the same time, new clustering techniques that seek the continuity of data, specially focused on spectral-based approaches in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches, have attracted an increasing research interest\u2014an area still under study by ACO clustering techniques. This work presents a hybrid spectral-based ACO clustering algorithm inspired by the ACO Clustering (ACOC) algorithm. The proposed approach combines ACOC with the spectral Laplacian to generate a new search space for the algorithm in order to obtain more promising solutions. The new algorithm, called SACOC, has been compared against well-known algorithms (K-means and Spectral Clustering) and with ACOC. The experimentsmeasure the accuracy of the algorithm for both synthetic datasets and realworld datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACO", "Clustering", "Data Mining", "Spectral"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921535709", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"42661760100": {"Name": "Men\u00e9ndez H.", "AuthorID": "42661760100", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7003774102": {"Name": "Camacho D.", "AuthorID": "7003774102", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "22734530000": {"Name": "Otero F.", "AuthorID": "22734530000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, University of Kent"}}}
