Heterostructures of insulating materials hold great promise, as confirmed by perovskite oxide superlattices with compositional substitution to artificially break the structural inversion symmetry 5-8 . Bringing this concept to the ultrathin limit would substantially broaden the range of materials and functionalities that could be exploited in novel nanoscale device designs. Here, we report that non-zero electric polarization can be induced and reversed in a hysteretic manner in bilayers made of ultrathin insulators whose electric polarization cannot be switched individually. In particular, we explore the interface between ionic rock salt alkali halides such as NaCl or KBr and polar insulating Cu2N terminating bulk copper. The strong compositional asymmetry between the polar Cu2N and the vacuum gap breaks inversion symmetry in the alkali halide layer, inducing out-of-plane dipoles that are stabilized in one orientation (self-poling). The dipole orientation can be reversed by a critical electric field, producing sharp switching of the tunnel current passing through the junction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical electric field", "Dipole orientation", "Electric polarization", "Inversion symmetry", "Perovskite oxide superlattices", "Rock salt structures", "Screening lengths", "Ultrathin insulators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031903414", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57196118264": {"Name": "Martinez-Castro J.", "AuthorID": "57196118264", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter Physics, University of Geneva"}, "6603182361": {"Name": "Hirjibehedin C.F.", "AuthorID": "6603182361", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "23089074900": {"Name": "Piantek M.", "AuthorID": "23089074900", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica de la Materia Condensada, Universidad de Zaragoza"}, "57196124118": {"Name": "Schubert S.", "AuthorID": "57196124118", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica de la Materia Condensada, Universidad de Zaragoza"}, "8640856600": {"Name": "Serrate D.", "AuthorID": "8640856600", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica de la Materia Condensada, Universidad de Zaragoza"}, "7201452101": {"Name": "Persson M.", "AuthorID": "7201452101", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
