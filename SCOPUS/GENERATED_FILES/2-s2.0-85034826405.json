They are being explored in a wide range of application scenarios from medical surgery to car dashboard controllers. One aspect of touchless interaction that has not been explored to date is the Sense of Agency (SoA). The SoA refers to the subjective experience of voluntary control over actions in the external world. In this paper, we investigated the SoA in touchless systems using the intentional binding paradigm. We first compare touchless systems with physical interactions and then augmented different types of haptic feedback to explore how different outcome modalities influence users' SoA. From our experiments, we demonstrated that an intentional binding effect is observed in both physical and touchless interactions with no statistical difference. Additionally, we found that haptic and auditory feedback help to increase SoA compared with visual feedback in touchless interfaces. We discuss these findings and identify design opportunities that take agency into consideration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gestures", "Haptics", "Intentional binding", "The sense of agency", "Touchless interfaces"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gestures", "Haptics", "Intentional binding", "Sense of agencies", "Touchless interfaces"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034826405", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57201447984": {"Name": "Martinez P.", "AuthorID": "57201447984", "AffiliationID": "120485678", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT Lab."}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "120485678", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT Lab."}, "56538648000": {"Name": "De Pirro S.", "AuthorID": "56538648000", "AffiliationID": "120485832", "AffiliationName": "SARIC"}, "55247108300": {"Name": "Vi C.", "AuthorID": "55247108300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab., University of Sussex"}}}
