The synthesis of a higher value chemical from L-arabinose, the predominant monosaccharide obtained from sugar beet pulp, is demonstrated here via a transketolase and transaminase coupled reaction. Thermostable transketolases derived from Deinococcus geothermalis and Deinococcus radiodurans catalysed the synthesis of L-gluco-heptulose from L-arabinose and \u03b2-hydroxypyruvate at elevated temperatures with high conversions. \u03b2-Hydroxypyruvate, a commercially expensive compound used in the transketolase reaction, was generated in situ from L-serine and \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid via a thermostable transaminase, also from Deinococcus geothermalis. The two steps were investigated and implemented in a one-pot system for the sustainable and efficient production of L-gluco-heptulose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hydroxypyruvate", "L-Arabinose", "L-Gluco-heptulose", "Thermostable", "Transaminase", "Transketolase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydroxypyruvate", "L-arabinose", "L-Gluco-heptulose", "Thermostable", "Transaminase", "Transketolase", "Arabinose", "Bacterial Proteins", "Biocatalysis", "Deinococcus", "Enzyme Stability", "Kinetics", "Molecular Structure", "Monosaccharides", "Pyruvates", "Transaminases", "Transketolase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047085921", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57195804016": {"Name": "Bawn M.", "AuthorID": "57195804016", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24470204700": {"Name": "Subrizi F.", "AuthorID": "24470204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
