It finds application in a vast diversity of fields: medicine, biology, many engineering disciplines, palaeontology and earth sciences are just few examples. The fundamental principle underpinning the image formation have remained the same for over a century: the X-rays traversing the sample are subjected to different amount of absorption in different parts of the sample. By means of phase-sensitive techniques it is possible to generate contrast also in relation to the phase shifts imparted by the sample and to extend the capabilities of X-ray imaging to those details that lack enough absorption contrast to be visualised in conventional radiography. A general overview of X-ray phase contrast imaging techniques is presented in this review, along with more recent advances in this fast evolving field and some examples of applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging", "Phase-contrast", "X-ray"], "IndexKeywords": ["Engineering disciplines", "Fundamental principles", "Internal structure", "Non destructive inspection", "Phase contrasts", "Phase-sensitive technique", "Standard tools", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026756494", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
