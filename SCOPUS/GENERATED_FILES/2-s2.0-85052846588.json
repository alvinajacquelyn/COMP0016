In particular, the focus was on the influence of changes to a hospital site and structure on the severity of medication errors. Methods: A retrospective clinical audit was undertaken over a 5-year period of paediatric medication errors submitted to an online voluntary reporting system of an Australian, tertiary, public teaching paediatric hospital. All medication errors submitted to the online system between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2015 were included. Results: A total of 3340 medication errors was reported, which corresponded to 0.56% medication errors per combined admissions and presentations or 5.73 medication errors per 1000 bed days. The most common patient outcomes related to errors requiring monitoring or an intervention to ensure no harm occurred (n = 1631, 48.8%). A new hospital site and structure had 0.354 reduced odds of producing medication errors causing possible or probable harm (95% confidence interval 0.298\u20130.421, P < 0.0001). Patient and family involvement had 1.270 increased odds of identifying medication errors associated with possible or probable harm compared with those causing no harm (95% confidence interval 1.028\u20131.568, P = 0.027). Interrupted time series analyses showed that moving to a new hospital site and structure was associated with a reduction in reported medication errors. Conclusion: Encouraging child and family involvement, facilitating hospital redesign and improving communication could help to reduce the harm associated with medication errors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["family involvement", "hospitalised child", "interdisciplinary communication", "medication error", "patient involvement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Causality", "Child", "Health Care Surveys", "Hospitalization", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Communication", "Medication Errors", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052846588", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"20034711700": {"Name": "Manias E.", "AuthorID": "20034711700", "AffiliationID": "60118634, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "6603176897": {"Name": "Newall F.", "AuthorID": "6603176897", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60026489", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "57193771739": {"Name": "Rosenfeld E.", "AuthorID": "57193771739", "AffiliationID": "60118634, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "18736809500": {"Name": "Weiner C.", "AuthorID": "18736809500", "AffiliationID": "60118634, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "56368428300": {"Name": "Borrott N.", "AuthorID": "56368428300", "AffiliationID": "60118634, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "7006934518": {"Name": "Kinney S.", "AuthorID": "7006934518", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60026489", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "6601977827": {"Name": "Cranswick N.", "AuthorID": "6601977827", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "15766627000": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "15766627000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, Monash University"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55210529900": {"Name": "Lai J.", "AuthorID": "55210529900", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "eResearch, Deakin University"}}}
