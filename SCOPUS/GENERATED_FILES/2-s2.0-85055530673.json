Organic LEDs (OLEDs) employing small molecules and long-chain polymers PLEDs, have been gaining attention within the VLC research community due to their inherent advantages such as flexible substrates and low-cost manufacturing. However, the carrier mobility of organic semiconductors is much slower than the devices composed of metal alloys, such as gallium nitride, thus leading to a restriction in the OLED modulation bandwidth. The manufacturing processes, materials and the photoactive size of the devices can affect the raw bandwidth of OLEDs. To increase the transmission speeds, novel approaches have been proposed including equalization techniques, signalling schemes and the optimum driver circuits. The paper provides a survey on the evolution of OLED-based VLC systems, and the respective challenges and recent progresses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Equalizers", "Optical channel", "Organic LEDs", "Visible light communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Equalization techniques", "Light emitting diode (LEDs)", "Low cost manufacturing", "Manufacturing process", "Optical channels", "Organic LEDs", "Organic leds (OLEDs)", "Visible light communications (VLC)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055530673", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57204433019": {"Name": "Chaleshtori Z.", "AuthorID": "57204433019", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems, University College London"}}}
