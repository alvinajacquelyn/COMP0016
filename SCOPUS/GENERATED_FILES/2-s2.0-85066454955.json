We compared M. tuberculosis whole genome sequences generated from 33 paired clinical samples using two methods. In one method DNA was extracted directly from sputum then enriched with custom-designed SureSelect (Agilent) oligonucleotide baits and in the other it was extracted from mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture. Results: DNA directly sequenced from sputum showed significantly more within-sample diversity than that from MGIT culture (median 5.0 vs 4.5 heterozygous alleles per sample, p = 0.04). Resistance associated variants present as HAs occurred in four patients, and in two cases may provide a genotypic explanation for phenotypic resistance. Conclusions: Culture-free M. tuberculosis whole genome sequencing detects more within-sample diversity than a leading culture-based method and may allow detection of mycobacteria that are not actively replicating.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug-resistant tuberculosis", "Heteroresistance", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Sputum", "Whole genome sequencing", "Within-patient diversity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Sputum", "Tuberculosis", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066454955", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55760740900": {"Name": "Nimmo C.", "AuthorID": "55760740900", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "55940101600": {"Name": "Doyle R.", "AuthorID": "55940101600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57202193242": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "57202193242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57195233273": {"Name": "Burgess C.", "AuthorID": "57195233273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57209072099": {"Name": "Brien K.", "AuthorID": "57209072099", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57200265521": {"Name": "Pym A.S.", "AuthorID": "57200265521", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57191197591": {"Name": "Shaw L.P.", "AuthorID": "57191197591", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford University"}, "6701693410": {"Name": "Balloux F.", "AuthorID": "6701693410", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}}}
