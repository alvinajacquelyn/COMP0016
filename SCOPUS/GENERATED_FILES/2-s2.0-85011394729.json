To identify outcome differences between distinct CTD-ILD groups derived following automated stratification of CALIPER variables. Methods: A total of 203 consecutive patients with assorted CTD-ILDs had CT parenchymal patterns evaluated by CALIPER and visual CT scoring: honeycombing, reticular pattern, ground glass opacities, pulmonary vessel volume, emphysema, and traction bronchiectasis. CT scores were evaluated against pulmonary function tests: forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide transfer coefficient, and composite physiologic index for mortality analysis. Automated stratification of CALIPER-CT variables was evaluated in place of and alongside forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide in the ILD gender, age physiology (ILD-GAP) model using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: Cox regression analyses identified four independent predictors of mortality: patient age (P < 0.0001), smoking history (P = 0.0003), carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (P = 0.003), and pulmonary vessel volume (P < 0.0001). Automated stratification of CALIPER variables identified three morphologically distinct groups which were stronger predictors of mortality than all CT and functional indices. The Stratified-CT model substituted automated stratified groups for functional indices in the ILD-GAP model and maintained model strength (area under curve (AUC) = 0.74, P < 0.0001), ILD-GAP (AUC = 0.72, P < 0.0001). Combining automated stratified groups with the ILD-GAP model (stratified CT-GAP model) strengthened predictions of 1- and 2-year mortality: ILD-GAP (AUC = 0.87 and 0.86, respectively); stratified CT-GAP (AUC = 0.89 and 0.88, respectively). Conclusions: CALIPER-derived pulmonary vessel volume is an independent predictor of mortality across all CTD-ILD patients. Furthermore, automated stratification of CALIPER CT variables represents a novel method of prognostication at least as robust as PFTs in CTD-ILD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer tomography", "Connective tissue disease", "Interstitial lung disease", "Pulmonary fibrosis", "Quantitative CT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Connective Tissue Diseases", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011394729", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57200973324": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57200973324", "AffiliationID": "60009009, 60022023", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "24069928400": {"Name": "Brun A.L.", "AuthorID": "24069928400", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology"}, "6701782045": {"Name": "Egashira R.", "AuthorID": "6701782045", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology"}, "7102078625": {"Name": "Hansell D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102078625", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology"}, "6602803945": {"Name": "Bartholmai B.J.", "AuthorID": "6602803945", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "8596434600": {"Name": "Rajagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "8596434600", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "6603861094": {"Name": "Karwoski R.", "AuthorID": "6603861094", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Interstitial Lung Disease Unit"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Interstitial Lung Disease Unit"}}}
