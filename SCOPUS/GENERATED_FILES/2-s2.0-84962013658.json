Numerosity and duration are, however, also different in several intrinsic features. For instance, in a quantification context, numerosity is known for being more automatically accessed than temporal events, and durations are by definition sequential whereas numerosity can be both sequential and simultaneous. Moreover, numerosity and duration processing diverge in terms of their neuronal correlates. Whether these observed neuronal specificities can be accounted for by differences in automaticity or presentation-mode is however not clear. To address this issue, we used brain stimulation (transcranial random noise stimulation, tRNS) to the right parietal cortex or the SMA combined with experimental stimuli differing in their level of automaticity (numerosity and duration) and presentation mode (sequential or simultaneous). Compared to a no stimulation group, performance changed in duration but not in numerosity categorisation following right parietal but not SMA stimulation. These results indicate that the right parietal cortex is critical for duration processing, and suggest that tRNS has a stronger effect on less automatic processes such as duration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automaticity", "Duration", "Numerosity", "Parietal cortex", "Presentation mode", "Supplemental Motor Area (SMA)", "Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Brain Mapping", "Concept Formation", "Discrimination (Psychology)", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Male", "Reaction Time", "Thinking", "Time Perception", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962013658", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"11239635100": {"Name": "Dormal V.", "AuthorID": "11239635100", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "6701372226": {"Name": "Pesenti M.", "AuthorID": "6701372226", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche en Sciences Psychologiques and Institute of Neuroscience, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"}, "7005240472": {"Name": "Walsh V.", "AuthorID": "7005240472", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7003283459": {"Name": "Cappelletti M.", "AuthorID": "7003283459", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department, Goldsmiths College, University of London"}, "36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.H.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}}}
