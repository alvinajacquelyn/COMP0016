Ten years after taking on board western market-orientated shock therapy, post-socialist societies are still struggling to come to terms with the clash between these deeply engrained moralities and the daily pressures to sell and consume. This book explores the new market and its resulting contradictions in a rapidly developing Eastern Europe and Russia. Will Western fast-food industries irrevocably alter local culinary practices? What effect has the privatization of land had upon ownership and exchange? What role do new commodities play within the household? Based on original, first-hand ethnography, this book is a long-awaited addition to existing literature on post-socialist societies. It will be essential reading for students of anthropology, sociology, European and cultural studies, as well as professional groups working in Eastern Europe and Russia, including NGOs, development organizations and businesses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091052883", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57220471001": {"Name": "Mandel R.", "AuthorID": "57220471001", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "9336166500": {"Name": "Humphrey C.", "AuthorID": "9336166500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
