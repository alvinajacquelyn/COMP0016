Namely, we show that the conditional mutual information is an upper bound on the regularized relative entropy distance between the quantum state and its reconstructed version. It is also an upper bound for the measured relative entropy distance of the state to its reconstructed version. The main ingredient of the proof is the fact that the conditional mutual information is the optimal quantum communication rate in the task of state redistribution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conditional mutual information", "Quantum state", "Relative entropy distances", "Upper Bound"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938812346", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7004791588": {"Name": "Brand\u00e3o F.", "AuthorID": "7004791588", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Architectures and Computation Group, Microsoft Research"}, "7004863695": {"Name": "Harrow A.", "AuthorID": "7004863695", "AffiliationID": "60003561, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Center for Theoretical Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7102137778": {"Name": "Oppenheim J.", "AuthorID": "7102137778", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University College London"}, "54919096000": {"Name": "Strelchuk S.", "AuthorID": "54919096000", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}}}
