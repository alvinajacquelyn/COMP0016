Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Analysis of melanosome biogenesis in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is challenging because it occurs predominantly in a short embryonic time window. Here, we show that the zebrafish provides an ideal model system for studying this process because in the RPE the timing of melanosome biogenesis facilitates molecular manipulation using morpholinos. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of OA1 (also known as GPR143), mutations in the human homologue of which cause the most common form of human ocular albinism, induces a major reduction in melanosome number, recapitulating a key feature of the mammalian disease where reduced melanosome numbers precede macromelanosome formation. We further show that PMEL, a key component of mammalian melanosome biogenesis, is required for the generation of cylindrical melanosomes in zebrafish, which in turn is required for melanosome movement into the apical processes and maintenance of photoreceptor integrity. Spherical and cylindrical melanosomes containing similar melanin volumes co-exist in the cell body but only cylindrical melanosomes enter the apical processes. Taken together, our findings indicate that melanosome number and shape are independently regulated and that melanosome shape controls a function in the RPE that depends on localisation in the apical processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Melanosome", "OA1", "PMEL", "Retinal pigment epithelium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Albinism, Ocular", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Melanosomes", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928684572", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"23666440300": {"Name": "Burgoyne T.", "AuthorID": "23666440300", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57197607183": {"Name": "O'Connor M.", "AuthorID": "57197607183", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College"}, "8854249500": {"Name": "Futter C.", "AuthorID": "8854249500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7102733325": {"Name": "Cutler D.", "AuthorID": "7102733325", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College"}, "7004369652": {"Name": "Seabra M.", "AuthorID": "7004369652", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "NHLI, Imperial College"}}}
