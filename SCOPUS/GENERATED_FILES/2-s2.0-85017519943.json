The MOST chemical energy storage system is based on norbornadiene-quadricyclane derivatives allowing for conversion of solar energy into stored chemical energy at up to 103 kJ mol-1 (396 kJ kg-1). It is demonstrated that 1.1% of incoming solar energy can be stored in the chemical system without significantly compromising the efficiency of the solar water heating system, leading to efficiencies of combined solar water heating and solar energy storage of up to 80%. Moreover, prospects for future improvement and possible applications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical energy", "Chemical systems", "Future improvements", "Hybrid devices", "Solar energy systems", "Solar thermal energy", "Solar water heating", "Solar water heating systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017519943", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57190980275": {"Name": "Dreos A.", "AuthorID": "57190980275", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, "57193922294": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57193922294", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, "29068121300": {"Name": "Roffey A.", "AuthorID": "29068121300", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, "6506896711": {"Name": "Moth-Poulsen K.", "AuthorID": "6506896711", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, "7801496544": {"Name": "B\u00f6rjesson K.", "AuthorID": "7801496544", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg"}, "55199836600": {"Name": "Norwood Z.", "AuthorID": "55199836600", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering"}, "25621327800": {"Name": "Kushnir D.", "AuthorID": "25621327800", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Energy and Environment, Environmental Systems Analysis"}}}
