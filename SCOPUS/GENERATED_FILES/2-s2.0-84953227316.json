Design Prospective, multicenter, noninterventional natural history study. Participants A total of 603 participants were enrolled in the study; 413 of those had gradable lesion data from FAF or CFP, and 321 had gradable lesion data from both FAF and CFP. Methods Atrophic lesion areas were measured by FAF and CFP to assess lesion progression over time. Lesion size assessments and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were conducted at screening/baseline (day 0) and at 3 follow-up visits: month 6, month 12, and month 18 (or early exit). Main Outcome Measures The GA lesion progression rate in disease subgroups and mean change from baseline visual acuity. Results Mean (standard error) lesion size changes from baseline, determined by FAF and CFP, respectively, were 0.88 (0.1) and 0.78 (0.1) mm2 at 6 months, 1.85 (0.1) and 1.57 (0.1) mm2 at 12 months, and 3.14 (0.4) and 3.17 (0.5) mm2 at 18 months. The mean change in lesion size from baseline to month 12 was significantly greater in participants who had eyes with multifocal atrophic spots compared with those with unifocal spots (P < 0.001) and those with extrafoveal lesions compared with those with foveal lesions (P = 0.001). The mean (standard deviation) decrease in visual acuity was 6.2 \u00b1 15.6 letters for patients with image data available. Atrophic lesions with a diffuse (mean 0.95 mm2) or banded (mean 1.01 mm2) FAF pattern grew more rapidly by month 6 compared with those with the \"none\" (mean, 0.13 mm2) and focal (mean, 0.36 mm2) FAF patterns. Conclusions Although differences were observed in mean lesion size measurements using FAF imaging compared with CFP, the measurements were highly correlated with one another. Significant differences were found in lesion progression rates in participants stratified by hyperfluorescence pattern subtype. This large GA natural history study provides a strong foundation for future clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Geographic Atrophy", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Optical Imaging", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953227316", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"6507005629": {"Name": "Schmitz-Valckenberg S.", "AuthorID": "6507005629", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "GRADE Reading Center, University of Bonn"}, "23979991600": {"Name": "Fleckenstein M.", "AuthorID": "23979991600", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "57201820304": {"Name": "Holz F.G.", "AuthorID": "57201820304", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "GRADE Reading Center, University of Bonn"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Sahel J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Institut de la Vision"}, "57208999643": {"Name": "Danis R.", "AuthorID": "57208999643", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin"}, "7004539481": {"Name": "Jaffe G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004539481", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University"}, "56892581600": {"Name": "Wolf S.", "AuthorID": "56892581600", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Bern, Inselspital, University Bern"}, "24480012700": {"Name": "Pruente C.", "AuthorID": "24480012700", "AffiliationID": "60013276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kantonsspital Baselland"}}}
