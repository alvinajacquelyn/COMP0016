It is currently in the early stages for the treatment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Advances in the understanding of ciliary biology and diagnostic techniques have opened up the prospect of treating BBS in a patient-specific manner. Owing to their structure and function, cilia provide an attractive therapeutic target and genetic therapies are being explored in ciliopathy treatment. Promising avenues include gene therapy, gene editing techniques and splice-correcting and read-through therapies. Targeted drug design has been successful in the treatment of genetic disease and research is underway in the discovery of known and novel drugs to treat Bardet-Biedl syndrome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bardet-Biedl syndrome", "deep phenotyping", "exon skipping", "gene editing", "gene therapy", "next-generation sequencing", "personalized medicine", "pharmacogenomics", "read-through therapy", "targeted drug therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bardet-Biedl Syndrome", "Cilia", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Pharmacogenetics", "Precision Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029948591", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55837408700": {"Name": "Kenny J.", "AuthorID": "55837408700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55250336400": {"Name": "Forsythe E.", "AuthorID": "55250336400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004556611": {"Name": "Beales P.", "AuthorID": "7004556611", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6507375825": {"Name": "Bacchelli C.", "AuthorID": "6507375825", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
