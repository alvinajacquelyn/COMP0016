Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Maternal nutrition in pregnancy has a key influence on optimum fetal health. Eating disorders (EDs) during pregnancy may have detrimental effects on fetal growth and the child\u2019s early development. There is limited knowledge concerning the eating behavior, dietary intake and derived nutritional biomarkers as well as the nutrient supplementation in women with EDs during pregnancy. We performed a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement to synthesize current evidence in this field. Of N = 1203 hits, 13 full-texts were included in the qualitative synthesis. While women with current Binge Eating Disorder (BED) showed higher energy and fat intakes during pregnancy, women with a lifetime Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) or both (AN + BN) had similar patterns of nutrient intake and dietary supplement use as healthy women. There is evidence, that women with a history of EDs have a sufficient diet quality and are more likely to be vegetarian. Dieting and bingeing improved substantially with pregnancy. The highlighted differences in the consumption of coffee/caffeine and artificially sweetened beverages as well as the elevated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in women with a past or active ED during pregnancy might have an important impact on fetal development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Anorexia nervosa", "Binge eating disorder", "Binge eating disorder", "Bulimia nervosa", "Bulimia nervosa", "Diet", "Diet", "Eating behavior", "Eating behavior", "Eating disorders", "Eating disorders", "Nutrition", "Nutrition", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy", "Purging", "Purging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eating", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Nutritional Status", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065289470", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57208626050": {"Name": "D\u00f6rsam A.F.", "AuthorID": "57208626050", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Medical University Hospital T\u00fcbingen"}, "57208629620": {"Name": "L\u00f6rcher S.B.", "AuthorID": "57208629620", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Medical University Hospital T\u00fcbingen"}, "7004510924": {"Name": "Zipfel S.", "AuthorID": "7004510924", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Medical University Hospital T\u00fcbingen"}, "24821231000": {"Name": "Giel K.E.", "AuthorID": "24821231000", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Medical University Hospital T\u00fcbingen"}, "7003800486": {"Name": "Prei\u00dfl H.", "AuthorID": "7003800486", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60136211", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases of the Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of T\u00fcbingen, fMEG Center, German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD)"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60026405, 60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}}}
