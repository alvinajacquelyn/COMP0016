The primary mirror requirements are: main wavelength of 935.5 nm, RMS corrected wavefront error of \u03bb/6, optical surface roughness better than 5 nm, areal density of less than 16 kg/m2 and 1-2 mirror shape corrections per orbit. The primary mirror consists of 7 segments - a central hexagonal mirror and 6 square mirror petals which unfold to form the 4-meter diameter aperture. The focus of the UK LATT consortium for this European Space Agency (ESA) funded project is on using lightweighted aluminium or carbon-fibre-composite materials for the mirror substrate in preference to more traditional materials such as glass and ceramics; these materials have a high strength and stiffness to weight ratio, significantly reducing risk of damage due to launch forces and subsequent deployment in orbit. We present an overview of the design, which includes suitable actuators for wavefront correction, petal deployment mechanisms and lightweight mirror technologies. Preliminary testing results from manufactured lightweight mirror samples will also be summarised.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon fibre composite materials", "Deployment mechanisms", "European Space Agency", "Large aperture telescopes", "Lightweight mirror technology", "Optical surface roughness", "Traditional materials", "Wavefront correction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040776777", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"10042560200": {"Name": "Thompson S.J.", "AuthorID": "10042560200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602539612": {"Name": "Doel A.P.", "AuthorID": "6602539612", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003707657": {"Name": "Whalley M.", "AuthorID": "7003707657", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6701487340": {"Name": "Edeson R.", "AuthorID": "6701487340", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6507332920": {"Name": "Tosh I.", "AuthorID": "6507332920", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55358509200": {"Name": "Poyntz-Wright O.", "AuthorID": "55358509200", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6603174087": {"Name": "Atad-Ettedgui E.", "AuthorID": "6603174087", "AffiliationID": "100630247", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre"}, "9037070000": {"Name": "Montgomery D.", "AuthorID": "9037070000", "AffiliationID": "100630247", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre"}, "44761507000": {"Name": "Nawasra J.", "AuthorID": "44761507000", "AffiliationID": "60075411", "AffiliationName": "ABSL Space Products"}}}
