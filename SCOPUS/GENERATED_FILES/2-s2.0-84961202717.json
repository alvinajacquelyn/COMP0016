But while this psychological research has been acquiring widespread recognition, a deeper understanding of how programmes work and of mechanisms for desistance more generally, has still to develop. This research reports results of a quasi-experimental recidivism outcome study for a series of prison units that provide intensive psychological treatment to high-risk, persistently violent prisoners. Four outcomes were examined over the first 12 months following release on parole: parole violations, new convictions, new convictions for violence, and imprisonment sentences resulting from new convictions. Alongside these results, we conducted preliminary analyses of two potential pre-release mechanisms for surviving the first 12 months on parole without reconviction: lower dynamic risk for violence, and greater release readiness. We found that dynamic violence risk fully accounted for differences between treatment completers and comparison prisoners in proportions reconvicted for violence. However, in all other cases, the proposed mechanisms did not significantly explain treatment-related differences. We close by considering possible explanations for these unexpected results, and reiterating the importance to our field of more sophisticated treatment outcome research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamic risk", "mechanisms", "re-entry readiness", "recidivism outcome", "Treatment", "violent offender"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961202717", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"6603529993": {"Name": "Polaschek D.", "AuthorID": "6603529993", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "54893765200": {"Name": "Yesberg J.", "AuthorID": "54893765200", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "56004442200": {"Name": "Bell R.", "AuthorID": "56004442200", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "35306654200": {"Name": "Casey A.", "AuthorID": "35306654200", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "55650024300": {"Name": "Dickson S.", "AuthorID": "55650024300", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
