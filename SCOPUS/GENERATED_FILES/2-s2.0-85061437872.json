Design: Evaluation of diagnostic test. Participants: Two hundred seventy-seven children, 0 to 16 years of age, diagnosed with nonsyndromic or syndromic developmental eye defects without a genetic diagnosis. Methods: We developed a new oculome panel using a custom-designed Agilent SureSelect QXT target capture method (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to capture and perform parallel high-throughput sequencing analysis of 429 genes associated with eye disorders. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing confirmed suspected pathogenic variants. Main Outcome Measures: Collated clinical details and oculome molecular genetic results. Results: The oculome design covers 429 known eye disease genes; these are subdivided into 5 overlapping virtual subpanels for anterior segment developmental anomalies including glaucoma (ASDA; 59 genes), microphthalmia\u2013anophthalmia\u2013coloboma (MAC; 86 genes), congenital cataracts and lens-associated conditions (70 genes), retinal dystrophies (RET; 235 genes), and albinism (15 genes), as well as additional genes implicated in optic atrophy and complex strabismus (10 genes). Panel development and testing included analyzing 277 clinical samples and 3 positive control samples using Illumina sequencing platforms; more than 30\u00d7 read depth was achieved for 99.5% of the targeted 1.77-Mb region. Bioinformatics analysis performed using a pipeline based on Freebayes and ExomeDepth to identify coding sequence and copy number variants, respectively, resulted in a definitive diagnosis in 68 of 277 samples, with variability in diagnostic yield between phenotypic subgroups: MAC, 8.2% (8 of 98 cases solved); ASDA, 24.8% (28 of 113 cases solved); other or syndromic, 37.5% (3 of 8 cases solved); RET, 42.8% (21 of 49 cases solved); and congenital cataracts and lens-associated conditions, 88.9% (8 of 9 cases solved). Conclusions: The oculome test diagnoses a comprehensive range of genetic conditions affecting the development of the eye, potentially replacing protracted and costly multidisciplinary assessments and allowing for faster targeted management. The oculome enabled molecular diagnosis of a significant number of cases in our sample cohort of varied ocular birth defects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child,
