Its capacity to break the resolution limit of around 300 nm allows for the routine imaging of nanoscale biological complexes and processes. This increase in resolution also means that methods popular in electron microscopy, such as single-particle analysis, can readily be applied to super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. By combining this analytical approach with super-resolution optical imaging, it becomes possible to take advantage of the molecule-specific labeling capacity of fluorescence microscopy to generate structural maps of molecular elements within a metastable structure. To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm \u2014 VirusMapper \u2014 packaged as an easy-to-use, high-performance, and high-throughput ImageJ plugin. This article presents an in-depth guide to this software, showcasing its ability to uncover novel structural features in biological molecular complexes. Here, we present how to assemble compatible data and provide a step-by-step protocol on how to use this algorithm to apply single-particle analysis to super-resolution images.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fiji", "Fluorescence microscopy", "Image analysis", "Issue 122", "Molecular Biology", "Single-particle analysis", "Software", "Super-resolution microscopy", "Vaccinia", "Viruses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017521442", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57190063529": {"Name": "Gray R.", "AuthorID": "57190063529", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in Life Sciences and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "14121881600": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "14121881600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "30067763700": {"Name": "Henriques R.", "AuthorID": "30067763700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
