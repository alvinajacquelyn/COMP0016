This is a tightly regulated process involving a complex interplay of various signals. The molecular mechanisms underlying several of these pathways are still incompletely understood. Here, we identify the signaling cascade of the C. elegans latrophilin homolog LAT-1, an essential player in the coordination of anterior-posterior spindle orientation during the fourth round of embryonic cell division. We show that the receptor mediates a G protein-signaling pathway revealing that G-protein signaling in oriented cell division is not solely GPCR-independent. Genetic analyses showed that through the interaction with a Gsprotein LAT-1 elevates intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the C. elegans embryo. Stimulation of this G-protein cascade in lat-1 null mutant nematodes is sufficient to orient spindles and cell division planes in the embryo in the correct direction. Finally, we demonstrate that LAT-1 is activated by an intramolecular agonist to trigger this cascade. Our data support a model in which a novel, GPCR-dependent G protein-signaling cascade mediated by LAT-1 controls alignment of cell division planes in an anterior-posterior direction via a metabotropic Gs-protein/adenylyl cyclase pathway by regulating intracellular cAMP levels.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenylyl Cyclases", "Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Division", "Cyclic AMP", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "GTP-Binding Proteins", "Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946595089", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56949625300": {"Name": "M\u00fcller A.", "AuthorID": "56949625300", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "56949959500": {"Name": "Winkler J.", "AuthorID": "56949959500", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "56949983300": {"Name": "Fiedler F.", "AuthorID": "56949983300", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "56950110400": {"Name": "Binder C.", "AuthorID": "56950110400", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "56951284000": {"Name": "Kungel J.", "AuthorID": "56951284000", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "7004333474": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6neberg T.", "AuthorID": "7004333474", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "24338959000": {"Name": "Pr\u00f6mel S.", "AuthorID": "24338959000", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biochemistry, Leipzig University"}, "56951160100": {"Name": "Sastradihardja T.", "AuthorID": "56951160100", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetics, TU Braunschweig"}, "56234735500": {"Name": "Schnabel R.", "AuthorID": "56234735500", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetics, TU Braunschweig"}, "35302390700": {"Name": "Hennig C.", "AuthorID": "35302390700", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetics, TU Braunschweig"}, "6701610753": {"Name": "Rothemund S.", "AuthorID": "6701610753", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Core Unit Peptide Technologies, Leipzig University"}}}
