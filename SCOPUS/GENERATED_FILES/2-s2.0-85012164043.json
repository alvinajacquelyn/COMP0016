This means that room temperature magnetoencephalography (MEG), with a greatly increased flexibility of sensor placement can now be considered. Further, these new sensors can be placed directly on the scalp surface giving, theoretically, a large increase in the magnitude of the measured signal. Here, we present recordings made using a single optically-pumped magnetometer (OPM) in combination with a 3D-printed head-cast designed to accurately locate and orient the sensor relative to brain anatomy. Since our OPM is configured as a magnetometer it is highly sensitive to environmental interference. However, we show that this problem can be ameliorated via the use of simultaneous reference sensor recordings. Using median nerve stimulation, we show that the OPM can detect both evoked (phase-locked) and induced (non-phase-locked oscillatory) changes when placed over sensory cortex, with signals ~4 times larger than equivalent SQUID measurements. Using source modelling, we show that our system allows localisation of the evoked response to somatosensory cortex. Further, source-space modelling shows that, with 13 sequential OPM measurements, source-space signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is comparable to that from a 271-channel SQUID system. Our results highlight the opportunity presented by OPMs to generate uncooled, potentially low-cost, high SNR MEG systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012164043", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57191490424": {"Name": "Boto E.", "AuthorID": "57191490424", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7006226016": {"Name": "Glover P.M.", "AuthorID": "7006226016", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "55521421200": {"Name": "Morris P.G.", "AuthorID": "55521421200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7005010989": {"Name": "Bowtell R.", "AuthorID": "7005010989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "8599486300": {"Name": "Brookes M.J.", "AuthorID": "8599486300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57191482453": {"Name": "Meyer S.S.", "AuthorID": "57191482453", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7201440598": {"Name": "Shah V.", "AuthorID": "7201440598", "AffiliationID": "60112977", "AffiliationName": "QuSpin Inc."}, "15135091400": {"Name": "Alem O.", "AuthorID": "15135091400", "AffiliationID": "60112977", "AffiliationName": "QuSpin Inc."}, "7004311991": {"Name": "Knappe S.", "AuthorID": "7004311991", "AffiliationID": "60112977", "AffiliationName": "QuSpin Inc."}, "57201568276": {"Name": "Kruger P.", "AuthorID": "57201568276", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Midlands Ultracold Atom Research Centre School of Physics and Astronomy University of Nottingham University Park"}, "7004472507": {"Name": "Fromhold T.M.", "AuthorID": "7004472507", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Midlands Ultracold Atom Research Centre School of Physics and Astronomy University of Nottingham University Park"}, "57192384738": {"Name": "Lim M.", "AuthorID": "57192384738", "AffiliationID": "117846334", "AffiliationName": "Chalk Studios Ltd."}}}
