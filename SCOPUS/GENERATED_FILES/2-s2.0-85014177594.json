Current methodologies require laboratory blood hematocrit (Hct) measurement \u2013 which complicates the technique. The attenuation of blood (HUblood) is known to change with anemia. We hypothesized that the relationship between Hct and HUblood could be calibrated to rapidly generate a synthetic ECV without formally measuring Hct. Methods The association between Hct and HUblood was derived from forty non-contrast thoracic CT scans using regression analysis. Synthetic Hct was then used to calculate synthetic ECV, and in turn compared with ECV using blood Hct in a validation cohort with mild interstitial expansion due to fibrosis (aortic stenosis, n = 28, ECVCT = 28 \u00b1 4%) and severe interstitial expansion due to amyloidosis (n = 27; ECVCT = 54 \u00b1 11%, p < 0.001). For histological validation, synthetic ECV was correlated with collagen volume fraction (CVF) in a separate cohort with aortic stenosis (n = 18). All CT scans were performed at 120 kV and 160 mAs. Results HUblood was a good predictor of Hct (R2 = 0.47; p < 0.01), with the regression model (Hct = [0.51 * HUblood] + 17.4) describing the association. Synthetic ECV correlated well with conventional ECV (R2 = 0.96; p < 0.01) with minimal bias and 2SD difference of 5.7%. Synthetic ECV correlated as well as conventional ECV with histological CVF (both R2 = 0.50, p < 0.01). Finally, we implemented an automatic ECV plug-in for offline analysis. Conclusion Synthetic ECV by CCT provides instantaneous quantification of the myocardial extracellular space without the need for blood sampling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac amyloidosis", "Computed tomography", "Extracellular matrix", "Myocardial extracellular volume fraction", "Myocardial fibrosis", "Myocardial tissue characterization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloidosis", "Automation", "Cardiomyopathies", "Fibrosis", "Hematocrit", "Humans", "Multidetector Computed Tomography", "Myocardium", "Observer Variation", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Regression Analysis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014177594", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "32367730300": {"Name": "Nasis A.", "AuthorID": "32367730300", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55083542800": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "55083542800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8894702000": {"Name": "Pugliese F.", "AuthorID": "8894702000", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics"}, "57014575700": {"Name": "Yeung J.", "AuthorID": "57014575700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57193493216": {"Name": "Sivarajan S.", "AuthorID": "57193493216", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
