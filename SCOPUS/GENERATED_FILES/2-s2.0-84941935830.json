Methods Ten years' retrospective antenatal screening and outcome data informed a cost-effectiveness analysis using the previously validated MONARCH model. The cost and quality of life outcomes associated with the screening and treatment of newly identified hepatitis C cases were used to generate cost-effectiveness estimates for the screening programme. Results A total of 35,355 women were screened between 1st November 2003 and 1st March 2013; 136 women (0.38%) were found to be HCV antibody positive. Of 78 (0.22%) viraemic cases, 44 (0.12%) were newly diagnosed. In addition, the screening programme identified three (6.8%) vertical transmissions in children of newly diagnosed mothers. Of 16 newly diagnosed mothers biopsied, all were in the F0-F2 METAVIR disease stages, and 50% had HCV genotype 1. Postnatal treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin was initiated in 19 women, with 14 (74%) achieving sustained virologic response. The total cost of screening and confirmation of diagnoses was estimated to be \u00a3240,641. This translates to \u00a35469 per newly diagnosed individual. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this screening and treatment strategy was \u00a32400 per QALY gained. Treatment with newer direct-acting antiviral regimens would have a projected cost of \u00a39139 per QALY gained, well below the \u00a320,000-30,000/QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold applied by policy advisory bodies. Conclusions This study demonstrates that an antenatal screening and treatment programme is feasible and effective, at a cost considered acceptable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antenatal", "Cost-effectiveness", "Hepatitis C", "MONARCH", "Pregnancy", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Incidence", "London", "Middle Aged", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941935830", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"19338183100": {"Name": "Selvapatt N.", "AuthorID": "19338183100", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Imperial College, St Mary's Hospital Campus"}, "7003963897": {"Name": "Thursz M.", "AuthorID": "7003963897", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Imperial College, St Mary's Hospital Campus"}, "7408338543": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "7408338543", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "56949870100": {"Name": "Ward T.", "AuthorID": "56949870100", "AffiliationID": "115582209", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Outcomes Research Limited"}, "56396205000": {"Name": "Bennett H.", "AuthorID": "56396205000", "AffiliationID": "115582209", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Outcomes Research Limited"}, "8760500200": {"Name": "McEwan P.", "AuthorID": "8760500200", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Swansea Centre for Health Economics, Swansea University"}, "37109433600": {"Name": "Bailey H.", "AuthorID": "37109433600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "56511475300": {"Name": "See L.M.", "AuthorID": "56511475300", "AffiliationID": "60028145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004188878": {"Name": "Tudor-Williams G.", "AuthorID": "7004188878", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of Paediatrics, St Mary's Hospital Campus, Imperial College"}}}
