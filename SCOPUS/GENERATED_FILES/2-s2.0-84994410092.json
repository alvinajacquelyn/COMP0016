Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), the most commonly performed procedures, lead to sustained weight loss, improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and reduced mortality. In humans, the main driver for weight loss following RYGB and SG is reduced energy intake. Reduced appetite, changes in subjective taste and food preference, and altered neural response to food cues are thought to drive altered eating behavior. The biological mediators underlying these changes remain incompletely understood but changes in gut-derived signals, as a consequence of altered nutrient and/or biliary flow, are key candidates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bariatric surgery", "Bile acids", "Eating behavior", "Gut hormones", "Microbiome", "Obesity", "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass", "Sleeve gastrectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy Intake", "Feeding Behavior", "Gastrectomy", "Gastric Bypass", "Humans", "Obesity, Morbid", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994410092", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57190406494": {"Name": "Makaronidis J.M.", "AuthorID": "57190406494", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
