A patient with a known diaphragmatic cyst presented with new onset right upper quadrant pain. Repeat imaging showed enlargement of the cyst, the CA19-9 cancer marker was raised at 312iu/ml (normal: <27iu/ml) and positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography showed focally increased uptake in the cystic wall. In view of symptoms and risk of neoplasia, the lesion was excised. Histology showed a benign epidermoid cyst. Features falsely suggesting neoplasia have been reported previously with benign splenic cysts but not with a benign diaphragmatic epidermoid cyst.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CA19-9", "Computed tomography", "Epidermoid cyst", "Positron emission tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diaphragm", "Epidermal Cyst", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Retroperitoneal Space", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Tumor Markers, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937553325", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56730197200": {"Name": "Robertson F.", "AuthorID": "56730197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "56337555000": {"Name": "Tsironis D.", "AuthorID": "56337555000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
