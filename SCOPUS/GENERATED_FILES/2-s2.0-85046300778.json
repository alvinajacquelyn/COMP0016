However, if the outcome is not sufficiently clearly defined, then different definitions could be applied and analysed, with only the most favourable result reported. Methods: In order to assess the impact that differing outcome definitions could have on treatment effect estimates, we re-analysed data from TRIGGER, a cluster randomised trial comparing two red blood cell transfusion strategies for patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We varied several aspects of the definition of further bleeding: (1) the criteria for what constitutes a further bleeding episode; (2) how further bleeding is assessed; and (3) the time-point at which further bleeding is measured. Results: There were marked discrepancies in the estimated odds ratios (OR) (range 0.23-0.94) and corresponding P values (range < 0.001-0.89) between different outcome definitions. At the extremes, differing outcome definitions led to markedly different conclusions; one definition led to very little evidence of a treatment effect (OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.37-2.40, P = 0.89), while another led to very strong evidence of a treatment effect (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.11-0.50, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Outcomes should be pre-specified in sufficient detail to avoid differing definitions being analysed and only the most favourable result being reported.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trial", "Outcome reporting bias", "Selective outcome reporting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bias", "Endpoint Determination", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Recurrence", "Research Design", "Risk Factors", "Terminology as Topic", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046300778", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"37064656300": {"Name": "Kahan B.", "AuthorID": "37064656300", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "16679040000": {"Name": "Jairath V.", "AuthorID": "16679040000", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western University, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}}}
