Here, we report the prespecified final analysis of this randomized trial. Patients and Methods: NCIC Clinical Trials Group PR.3/Medical Research Council PR07/Intergroup T94-0110 was a randomized controlled trial of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Patients with T3-4, N0/Nx, M0 prostate cancer or T1-2 disease with either prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of more than 40 \u03bcg/L or PSA of 20 to 40 \u03bcg/L plus Gleason score of 8 to 10 were randomly assigned to lifelong ADT alone or to ADT+RT. The RT dose was 64 to 69 Gy in 35 to 39 fractions to the prostate and pelvis or prostate alone. Overall survival was compared using a log-rank test stratified for prespecified variables. Results: One thousand two hundred five patients were randomly assigned between 1995 and 2005, 602 to ADT alone and 603 to ADT+RT. At a median follow-up time of 8 years, 465 patients had died, including 199 patients from prostate cancer. Overall survival was significantly improved in the patients allocated to ADT+RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.85; P < .001). Deaths from prostate cancer were significantly reduced by the addition of RT to ADT (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61; P < .001). Patients on ADT+RT reported a higher frequency of adverse events related to bowel toxicity, but only two of 589 patients had grade 3 or greater diarrhea at 24 months after RT. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrates that the previously reported benefit in survival is maintained at a median follow-up of 8 years and firmly establishes the role of RT in the treatment of men with locally advanced prostate cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Androgen Antagonists", "Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal", "Cause of Death", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Survival Analysis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937533769", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7201987236": {"Name": "Mason M.D.", "AuthorID": "7201987236", "AffiliationID": "60103683, 60016901", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University School of Medicine, Velindre Hospital"}, "7402350524": {"Name": "Barber J.B.P.", "AuthorID": "7402350524", "AffiliationID": "60016901", "AffiliationName": "Velindre Hospital"}, "55836382400": {"Name": "Sydes M.R.", "AuthorID": "55836382400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7102310808": {"Name": "Parmar M.K.B.", "AuthorID": "7102310808", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "23970530000": {"Name": "Jovic G.", "AuthorID": "23970530000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7004477181": {"Name": "Kirkbride P.", "AuthorID": "7004477181", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57205570262": {"Name": "Cowan R.", "AuthorID": "57205570262", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60028784", "AffiliationName": "Christie Hospital, University of Manchester"}, "56137320600": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "56137320600", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "7006932717": {"Name": "Hetherington J.", "AuthorID": "7006932717", "AffiliationID": "60025144", "AffiliationName": "Castle Hill Hospital"}, "6603220600": {"Name": "El-Sharkawi S.", "AuthorID": "6603220600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "South West Wales Cancer Centre"}, "57205003985": {"Name": "Hardman P.D.J.", "AuthorID": "57205003985", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "James Cook University Hospital"}, "6603176839": {"Name": "Parulekar W.R.", "AuthorID": "6603176839", "AffiliationID": "60016005", "AffiliationName": "NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University"}, "56203245900": {"Name": "Hiltz A.", "AuthorID": "56203245900", "AffiliationID": "60016005", "AffiliationName": "NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University"}, "8243453300": {"Name": "Chen B.E.", "AuthorID": "8243453300", "AffiliationID": "60016005", "AffiliationName": "NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University"}, "7003574359": {"Name": "Brundage M.", "AuthorID": "7003574359", "AffiliationID": "106587759", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario"}, "7005934430": {"Name": "Gospodarowicz M.", "AuthorID": "7005934430", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60008768", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"}, "7005254014": {"Name": "Warde P.", "AuthorID": "7005254014", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60008768", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"}, "7005696164": {"Name": "Hayter C.", "AuthorID": "7005696164", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto, Carlo Fidani Peel Regional Cancer Center"}, "7801400128": {"Name": "Kostashuk E.C.", "AuthorID": "7801400128", "AffiliationID": "100334164", "AffiliationName": "Fraser Valley Cancer Centre"}, "7103119887": {"Name": "McKenzie M.", "AuthorID": "7103119887", "AffiliationID": "100336866", "AffiliationName": "Vancouver Cancer Centre"}, "6507214856": {"Name": "Sathya J.", "AuthorID": "6507214856", "AffiliationID": "60019000", "AffiliationName": "Memorial University of Newfoundland"}, "57207600356": {"Name": "Souhami L.", "AuthorID": "57207600356", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University"}, "7203020316": {"Name": "Swanson G.", "AuthorID": "7203020316", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas Health Science Center"}}}
