A selection of C3S grains were segmented and rendered with 3D-image processing software, which allowed the C3S grains to be clearly visualized and enabled statistically quantitative analysis. The results show that about 5% of the C3S grains have volumes larger than 1 \u03bcm3 and the average volume of the grains is 25 \u03bcm3. Pores can also be clearly seen in the biggest C3S grain, the volume of which is 3.6 \u00d7 104 \u03bcm3, and the mean volume and total volume of all the pores within this grain are 4.8 \u03bcm3 and 3.0 \u00d7 103 \u03bcm3, respectively. The reported work provides a new approach for the characterization of the 3D spatial structure of raw C3S materials, and the resulting 3D structure of the raw C3S is important for further systematic research on the relationships between the spatial microstructure and the hydration kinetics of C3S and other cement minerals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Porosity", "Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM)", "Three-dimensional (3D) structure", "Tricalcium silicate (C3S)"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D image processing", "3D spatial structure", "Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM)", "Systematic research", "Three dimensional (3D) structures", "Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures", "Three-dimensional microstructures", "Tricalcium silicate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049188678", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57202745450": {"Name": "Yang F.", "AuthorID": "57202745450", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "23501649700": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "23501649700", "AffiliationID": "60073652, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Civil Engineering Materials (Tongji University), Ministry of Education"}, "57202743643": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "57202743643", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "57202753923": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57202753923", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "7405460437": {"Name": "Wang P.", "AuthorID": "7405460437", "AffiliationID": "60073652, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Civil Engineering Materials (Tongji University), Ministry of Education"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60025119, 60006221", "AffiliationName": "Division of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "57212182785": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "57212182785", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
