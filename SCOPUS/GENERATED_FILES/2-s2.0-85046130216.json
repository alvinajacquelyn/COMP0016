All rights are reserved.This title reflects the exponential growth in the knowledge and information on this subject and defines the extensive clinical translation of cardiovascular genetics and genomics in clinical practice. This concise, clinically oriented text is targeted at a broad range of clinicians who manage patients and families with a wide range of heterogeneous inherited cardiovascular conditions. Cardiovascular Genetics and Genomics: Principles and Clinical Practice includes a concise and clear account on selected topics written by a team of leading experts on clinical cardiovascular genetics. Each chapter include key information to assist the clinician and case histories have been incorporated to reflect contemporary practice in clinical cardiovascular genetics and genomics. Therefore this will be of key importance to all professionals working in the discipline, from clinicians and trainees in cardiology, cardiac surgery, electrophysiology, immunology through geneticists, nursing staff and those involved in precision medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046130216", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57217453036": {"Name": "Kumar D.", "AuthorID": "57217453036", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}}}
