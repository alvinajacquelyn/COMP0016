In collision with Ar and Xe, the total cross sections of positronium are found to be smallest at the lowest energy probed, approaching those of the Ramsauer-Townsend minima for electron projectiles. Additional structure has been observed in the case of positronium scattering at incident energies around 5 eV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Additional structures", "Beam energies", "Energy ranges", "Incident energy", "Positronium atom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949658394", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"23468672500": {"Name": "Brawley S.", "AuthorID": "23468672500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56423845900": {"Name": "Fayer S.", "AuthorID": "56423845900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57202669621": {"Name": "Shipman M.", "AuthorID": "57202669621", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004221275": {"Name": "Laricchia G.", "AuthorID": "7004221275", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
