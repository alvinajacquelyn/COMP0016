Materials and Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted for studies on periodontal regeneration on Medline and EMBASE, complemented by a manual search. Initially, 3310 potentially eligible articles were identified. Results: A total of 293 studies were included in the review. Nearly 10 % of studies did not include NSPT in the study protocol before regenerative surgery, while 14 % of papers did not report this aspect. Seventy-six percent of studies reported that non-surgical subgingival debridement was performed before periodontal surgery (2 weeks to 6 months before surgery according to the different studies). However, no papers reported clinical and radiographic data before and after NSPT prior to periodontal surgery. Only 45 % of papers reported timing of reassessment following NSPT, prior to proceeding with regenerative surgery. Conclusions: This review highlights the lack of reporting information on non-surgical periodontal therapy prior to periodontal regenerative surgery, calling for a revision of the current clinical protocols and of the study designs of periodontal regenerative surgery studies. Clinical relevance: Periodontal regenerative surgery protocols should take into account the possible effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy in the clinical and radiographic healing of intrabony defects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intrabony defects", "Non-surgical therapy", "Periodontitis", "Regeneration", "Study design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Periodontal Diseases", "Regeneration", "Regenerative Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942984505", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit and Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "55340111100": {"Name": "Pelekos G.", "AuthorID": "55340111100", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong"}, "56584331400": {"Name": "Onabolu O.", "AuthorID": "56584331400", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit and Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit and Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
