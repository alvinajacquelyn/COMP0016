The effect of coke on methane diffusion inside the zeolite pores was studied by quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements on Mo/H-ZSM-5 samples reacted with methane for 0, 7, 25 and 60 min. Catalytic activity of the samples followed by mass spectrometry indicate that the induction period in which Mo species are carburized lasts for \u223c9 min; after this period the material shows selectivity to aromatics. Characterization by TGA and N2 physisorption suggest that practically no carbon is deposited during the induction period. The \u223c2 wt % of coke formed after one hour of reaction has a negligible effect in the zeolite crystal structurebut a small effect on the micropore volume. The QENS studies show that the methane transport by jump diffusion is however not measurably affected by the accumulated coke in the samples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048438963", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"15073619700": {"Name": "Silverwood I.P.", "AuthorID": "15073619700", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57202450063": {"Name": "Ar\u00e1n M.A.", "AuthorID": "57202450063", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57202452772": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez I.L.", "AuthorID": "57202452772", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55372640600": {"Name": "Kroner A.", "AuthorID": "55372640600", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
