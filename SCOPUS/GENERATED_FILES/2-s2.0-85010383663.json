However, such studies cannot establish whether these areas are causally involved in tactile motion perception. We delivered double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while moving a single tactile point across the fingertip, and used signal detection theory to quantify perceptual sensitivity to motion direction. TMS over both SI and V5/hMT+, but not the PPC site, significantly reduced tactile direction discrimination. Our results show that V5/hMT+ plays a causal role in tactile direction processing, and strengthen the case for V5/hMT+ serving multimodal motion perception. Further, our findings are consistent with a serial model of cortical tactile processing, in which higher-order perceptual processing depends upon information received from SI. By contrast, our results do not provide clear evidence that the PPC site we targeted (Brodmann areas 7/40) contributes to tactile direction perception.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Parietal Lobe", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Touch Perception", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010383663", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57061940700": {"Name": "Amemiya T.", "AuthorID": "57061940700", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}, "56008169700": {"Name": "Beck B.", "AuthorID": "56008169700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, Alexandra House"}, "7005240472": {"Name": "Walsh V.", "AuthorID": "7005240472", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, Alexandra House"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, Alexandra House"}, "55349671400": {"Name": "Gomi H.", "AuthorID": "55349671400", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}}}
