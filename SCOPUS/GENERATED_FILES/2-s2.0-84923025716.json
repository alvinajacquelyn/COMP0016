Variants evolved on propanal were found previously with nascent activity on polar aromatic aldehydes 3-formylbenzoic acid (3-FBA), 4-formylbenzoic acid (4-FBA), and 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3-HBA), suggesting a potential novel route to analogues of chloramphenicol. Here we evolved improved transketolase activities towards aromatic aldehydes, by saturation mutagenesis of two active-site residues (R358 and S385), predicted to interact with the aromatic substituents. S385 variants selectively controlled the aromatic substrate preference, with up to 13-fold enhanced activities, and KM values comparable to those of natural substrates with wild-type transketolase. S385E even completely removed the substrate inhibition for 3-FBA, observed in all previous variants. The mechanisms of catalytic improvement were both mutation type and substrate dependent. S385E improved 3-FBA activity via kcat, but reduced 4-FBA activity via KM. Conversely, S385Y/T improved 3-FBA activity via KM and 4-FBA activity via kcat. This suggested that both substrate proximity and active-site orientation are very sensitive to mutation. Comparison of all variant activities on each substrate indicated different binding modes for the three aromatic substrates, supported by computational docking. This highlights a potential divergence in the evolution of different substrate specificities, with implications for enzyme engineering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benzaldehyde", "Biocatalysis", "Directed evolution", "Enzyme engineering", "Transketolase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benzaldehyde", "Biocatalysis", "Directed evolution", "Enzyme engineering", "Transketolase", "Aldehydes", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Catalytic Domain", "Directed Molecular Evolution", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic", "Kinetics", "Models, Molecular", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Recombinant Proteins", "Substrate Specificity", "Transketolase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923025716", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"54684815500": {"Name": "Payongsri P.", "AuthorID": "54684815500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005337410": {"Name": "Steadman D.", "AuthorID": "7005337410", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
