Although the fate of these nano-particles can be macroscopically tracked in the body (e.g. using radio-labeling techniques), there is little information about the sub-cellular scale mechanistic processes underlying the particle-tissue interactions, or how these interactions may correlate with pharmaceutical efficacy. To rationally engineer these nano-particles and thus optimize their performance, these mechanistic interactions must be fully understood. Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy provides a label-free means for visualizing biological samples, but can suffer from a strong non-resonant background in samples that are prepared using aldehyde-based fixatives. We demonstrate how formalin fixative affects the detection of polymeric nanoparticles within kidneys following oral administration using CARS microscopy, compared with samples that were snap-frozen. These findings have implications for clinical applications of CARS for probing nanoparticle distribution in tissue biopsies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autofluorescence", "CARS", "drug delivery", "imaging", "microscopy", "nanoparticle", "Raman"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autofluorescence", "Biological samples", "Clinical application", "Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy", "Oral administration", "Polymeric nanoparticles", "Raman", "Tissue interactions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932174847", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"26534168900": {"Name": "Garrett N.L.", "AuthorID": "26534168900", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Exeter, UCL"}, "9845817300": {"Name": "Moger J.", "AuthorID": "9845817300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Exeter, UCL"}, "56423382200": {"Name": "Godfrey L.", "AuthorID": "56423382200", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy"}, "7004524463": {"Name": "Uchegbu I.F.", "AuthorID": "7004524463", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy"}, "6604050498": {"Name": "Schatzlein A.", "AuthorID": "6604050498", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy"}, "55197260500": {"Name": "Lalatsa A.", "AuthorID": "55197260500", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "55345467100": {"Name": "Serrano D.R.", "AuthorID": "55345467100", "AffiliationID": "60016574, 60027282", "AffiliationName": "Departmento de Farmacia y Tecnologia Farmaceutica, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}}}
