The author used the argument made by Cowan, Rosen, and Moore (2009), referring to central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), that \u201csuch impairments have not been shown to uniquely contribute to a clearly defined condition that would warrant its inclusion in any of the major disease classification systems\u201d (emphasis added; p. 129). However, CAPD is included in the U.S. version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\u201310th Revision (ICD-10) under the code H93.25; this was not mentioned in the article by DeBonis.
