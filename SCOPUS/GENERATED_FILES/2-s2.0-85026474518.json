Along the same line, the recent availability of large-scale human mobility and communication data has offered novel quantitative insights hinting at a strong geographical confinement of human interactions within neighboring regions, extending to local levels within countries. However, models of human interaction largely ignore this effect. Here, we analyze several country-wide networks of telephone calls - both, mobile and landline - And in either case uncover a systematic decrease of communication induced by borders which we identify as the missing variable in state-of-the-art models. Using this empirical evidence, we propose an alternative modeling framework that naturally stylizes the damping effect of borders. We show that this new notion substantially improves the predictive power of widely used interaction models. This increases our ability to understand, model and predict social activities and to plan the development of infrastructures across multiple scales.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Communication", "Geography", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Population Dynamics", "Social Behavior", "Telephone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026474518", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"34967974400": {"Name": "Grauwin S.", "AuthorID": "34967974400", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Senseable City Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "36158844200": {"Name": "Szell M.", "AuthorID": "36158844200", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182614", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Social Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "16640202600": {"Name": "Sobolevsky S.", "AuthorID": "16640202600", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University"}, "35230766400": {"Name": "Ratti C.", "AuthorID": "35230766400", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Senseable City Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "14056159100": {"Name": "H\u00f6vel P.", "AuthorID": "14056159100", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t Zu Berlin"}, "26640772200": {"Name": "Simini F.", "AuthorID": "26640772200", "AffiliationID": "60030035", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics"}, "7006567633": {"Name": "Barab\u00e1si A.L.", "AuthorID": "7006567633", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57195242791": {"Name": "Vanhoof M.", "AuthorID": "57195242791", "AffiliationID": "60104081", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement SENSE, Orange Labs"}, "26640645700": {"Name": "Smoreda Z.", "AuthorID": "26640645700", "AffiliationID": "60104081", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement SENSE, Orange Labs"}}}
