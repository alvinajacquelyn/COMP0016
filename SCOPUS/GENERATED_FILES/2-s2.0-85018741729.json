All rights reserved.We recently demonstrated that soluble forms of the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (sA\u03b2PP) assemble into multimeric complexes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which contributes to the underestimation of specific sA\u03b2PP species when assessed by ELISA. To circumvent this issue, we analyzed by SDS-PAGE large fragments of sA\u03b2PP and their variants in the CSF from Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 20) and control (n = 20) subjects, probing with specific antibodies against particular domains. Similar levels of sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 protein were found in CSF samples from AD and controls, yet there appeared to be a shift in the balance of the soluble full-length A\u03b2PP (sA\u03b2PPf) species in AD samples, with a decrease in the proportion of the lower (\u223c100 kDa) band relative to the upper (\u223c120 kDa) band. Similar differences were observed in the contribution of the major KPI-immunoreactive A\u03b2PP species. CSF samples also displayed differences in the correlations of A\u03b2PP species with classical AD biomarkers, particularly with respect to the A\u03b242 peptide. The differences reveal alterations that probably reflect pathophysiological changes in the brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "A\u03b2PP", "biomarker", "cerebrospinal fluid", "KPI", "sA\u03b2PPf", "sA\u03b2PP\u03b2", "sA\u03b2PP\u03b2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Biomarkers", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018741729", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36183964700": {"Name": "Lopez-Font I.", "AuthorID": "36183964700", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "57194104700": {"Name": "Boix C.", "AuthorID": "57194104700", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "6603788896": {"Name": "S\u00e1ez-Valero J.", "AuthorID": "6603788896", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal Campus"}, "7006291713": {"Name": "Calero M.", "AuthorID": "7006291713", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
