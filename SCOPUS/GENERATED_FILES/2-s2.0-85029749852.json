This has been applied to processing of European extremely large telescope (E-ELT) prototype mirror-segments, meeting the specification on maximum edge mis-figure. However we have observed residuals that have proved impossible to correct with this approach, being in part the legacy of asymmetries in the input edge-profiles. Methods: We have therefore compared different proposed methods experimentally and theoretically and report here on a new edge-rectification step, which operates locally on edges, does not disturb the completed bulk area. Results: A new toolpath has been developed and experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that local edge rectification can be carried out. Conclusions: With this method, the residue error on edges can be removed separately and has potential to reduce total process time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Optical fabrication", "Polishing", "Segment mirror", "Telescopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["CNC polishing", "Edge controls", "Extremely Large Telescopes", "Input edges", "Optical fabrication", "Process time", "Residue error", "Segment mirror"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029749852", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57201438378": {"Name": "Yu G.", "AuthorID": "57201438378", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "National Facility for Ultra Precision Surfaces, OpTIC Centre, University of Huddersfield, St. Asaph Business Park, Ffordd William Morgan"}, "7404441122": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "7404441122", "AffiliationID": "60103017", "AffiliationName": "Zeeko Ltd"}, "54581218000": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "54581218000", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Researh Center for Space Optical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57013777300": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "57013777300", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "National Facility for Ultra Precision Surfaces, OpTIC Centre, University of Huddersfield, St. Asaph Business Park, Ffordd William Morgan"}, "6507185016": {"Name": "Beaucamp A.", "AuthorID": "6507185016", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Kyoto University"}}}
