According to cognitive load theory, this effect reflects the greater cognitive demands of retrieving contextual information from study phase. Pupil dilation can also occur when new items conceptually related to old ones are erroneously recognized as old, but the aspects of similarity that modulate false memory and related pupil responses remain unclear. We investigated this issue by manipulating the degree of featural similarity between new (unstudied) and old (studied) concepts in an old/new recognition task. We found that new concepts with high similarity were mistakenly identified as old and had greater pupil dilation than those with low similarity, suggesting that pupil dilation reflects the strength of evidence on which recognition judgments are based and, importantly, greater locus coeruleus and prefrontal activity determined by the higher degree of retrieval monitoring involved in recognizing these items.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system", "Pupil diameter", "Recognition task", "Retrieval monitoring", "Semantic similarity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pupil", "Reaction Time", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Repression, Psychology", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045580354", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"]], "AuthorData": {"55735884100": {"Name": "Montefinese M.", "AuthorID": "55735884100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7005928441": {"Name": "Vinson D.", "AuthorID": "7005928441", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "36647283500": {"Name": "Ambrosini E.", "AuthorID": "36647283500", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Imaging and Clinical Sciences, University of Chieti"}}}
