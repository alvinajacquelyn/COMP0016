Recently, different approaches have been proposed to investigate the use of different sensing and phone interaction features, including location, call, SMS and overall application usage logs, to infer the depressive state of users. In this paper, we propose an approach for monitoring of depressive states using multi-modal sensing via smartphones. Through a brief literature review we show the sensing modalities that have been exploited in the past studies for monitoring depression. We then present the initial results of an ongoing study to demonstrate the association of depressive states with the smartphone interaction features. Finally, we discuss the challenges in predicting depression through multimodal mobile sensing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticipatory Computing", "Behaviour Change Interventions.", "Depression", "Mobile Sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticipatory computing", "Behaviour changes", "Depression", "Interaction features", "Literature reviews", "Mobile sensing", "Multi-modal sensing", "Sensing modalities"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991051844", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"56468916300": {"Name": "Mehrotra A.", "AuthorID": "56468916300", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, University College London"}, "6505786506": {"Name": "Hendley R.", "AuthorID": "6505786506", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
