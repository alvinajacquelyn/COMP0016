We show that a bandwidth saving up to 30% can be achieved thus resulting in 44% improvement in the measured spectral efficiency with no further bit error rate performance degradation compared to the traditional m-CAP scheme. We also show that higher order systems can provide higher bandwidth compression than low order systems. Furthermore, with no additional functional blocks at the transmitter or the receiver the proposed scheme introduces no extra computational complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multi-band carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation", "non-orthogonal", "visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bandwidth savings", "Bit error rate (BER) performance", "Carrier-less", "Functional block", "Higher-order systems", "Low order system", "Non-orthogonal", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055509238", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems Group, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems Group, University College London"}, "6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University"}}}
