Most simply, dystonia, is a classifier which is reached when a predominant abnormality of posture is noted. In this chapter we summarize studies that have used a variety of techniques to probe beyond the clinical examination and study kinematic features experimentally. We also outline our experimental work in DYT1 dystonia, a group of patients that share a genetically homogenous etiology and can be considered a prototypical dystonic disorder. Our results build on previous studies, confirming that motor variability on a trial-by-trial basis is selectively increased and provide evidence that increases in variability are negatively related to forms of motor learning essential for healthy motor control. Potential neural correlates of increased motor variability are discussed and the implications such work has for the rehabilitation of patients with dystonia are also highlighted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Dystonia", "Motor learning", "Rehabilitation", "Variability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Dystonia Musculorum Deformans", "Dystonic Disorders", "Humans", "Learning", "Motor Activity", "Psychomotor Performance"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067338261", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6507878404": {"Name": "Sadnicka A.", "AuthorID": "6507878404", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.J.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Motor Control and Movement Disorder Group, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London"}, "15057771300": {"Name": "Galea J.", "AuthorID": "15057771300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}}}
