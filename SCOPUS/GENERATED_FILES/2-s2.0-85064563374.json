We have developed this approach for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPSIIIA), a devastating lysosomal storage disease that causes progressive cognitive decline, leading to death in early adulthood. In a previous pre-clinical proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated neurological correction of MPSIIIA utilizing hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy via a lentiviral vector encoding the SGSH gene. Prior to moving to clinical trial, we have undertaken further studies to evaluate the efficiency of gene transfer into human cells and also safety studies of biodistribution and genotoxicity. Here, we have optimized hCD34+ cell transduction with clinical grade SGSH vector to provide improved pharmacodynamics and cell viability and validated effective scale-up and cryopreservation to generate an investigational medicinal product. Utilizing a humanized NSG mouse model, we demonstrate effective engraftment and biodistribution, with no vector shedding or transmission to germline cells. SGSH vector genotoxicity assessment demonstrated low transformation potential, comparable to other lentiviral vectors in the clinic. This data establishes pre-clinical safety and efficacy of HSCGT for MPSIIIA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064563374", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"23972258100": {"Name": "Ellison S.M.", "AuthorID": "23972258100", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "42161704600": {"Name": "Liao A.", "AuthorID": "42161704600", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "57203760208": {"Name": "Wood S.", "AuthorID": "57203760208", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "57201024675": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "57201024675", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "36652253400": {"Name": "Youshani A.S.", "AuthorID": "36652253400", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "57201913104": {"Name": "Rowlston S.", "AuthorID": "57201913104", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "57200295774": {"Name": "Parker H.", "AuthorID": "57200295774", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "6602317807": {"Name": "Bigger B.W.", "AuthorID": "6602317807", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Group, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, Division of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "6602486003": {"Name": "Armant M.", "AuthorID": "6602486003", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "7003906961": {"Name": "Biffi A.", "AuthorID": "7003906961", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "55913345400": {"Name": "Chan L.", "AuthorID": "55913345400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Molecular Medicine Group, The Rayne Institute"}, "55524778500": {"Name": "Farzaneh F.", "AuthorID": "55524778500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Molecular Medicine Group, The Rayne Institute"}, "7101799608": {"Name": "Wynn R.", "AuthorID": "7101799608", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Children's Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "55732366100": {"Name": "Jones S.A.", "AuthorID": "55732366100", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Children's Hospital, NHS Trust"}, "6508117051": {"Name": "Heal P.", "AuthorID": "6508117051", "AffiliationID": "118481943", "AffiliationName": "Orchard Therapeutics Ltd."}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Instititute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
