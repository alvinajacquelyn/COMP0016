The nebula is shown to comprise a compact hourglassshaped central region and a pair of precessing jet-like structures. Time-resolved spectroscopy of its central star reveals a periodic radial velocity variability consistent with a binary system. Whilst the data are insufficient to accurately determine the parameters of the binary, the most likely solutions indicate that the secondary is probably a low-mass main-sequence star. An empirical analysis of the chemical abundances in IC 4776 indicates that the common-envelope phase may have cut short the asymptotic giant branch evolution of the progenitor. Abundances calculated from recombination lines are found to be discrepant by a factor of approximately 2 relative to those calculated using collisionally excited lines, suggesting a possible correlation between low-abundance discrepancy factors and intermediate-period post-common-envelope central stars and/or Wolf-Rayet central stars. The detection of a radial velocity variability associated with the binarity of the central star of IC 4776 may be indicative of a significant population of (intermediate-period) post-common-envelope binary central stars that would be undetected by classic photometric monitoring techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binaries: spectroscopic", "ISM: jets and outflows", "Planetary nebulae: individual: (IC 4776, PN G002.0-13.4)", "Stars: mass-loss"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045943396", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56048174400": {"Name": "Sowicka P.", "AuthorID": "56048174400", "AffiliationID": "60027686", "AffiliationName": "Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center"}, "57203189818": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57203189818", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "35508140800": {"Name": "Corradi R.L.M.", "AuthorID": "35508140800", "AffiliationID": "123399942", "AffiliationName": "GRANTECAN"}, "6603928860": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Rojas J.", "AuthorID": "6603928860", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "55947765600": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Gil P.", "AuthorID": "55947765600", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "7003586236": {"Name": "Wesson R.", "AuthorID": "7003586236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6506974576": {"Name": "Santander-Garc\u00eda M.", "AuthorID": "6506974576", "AffiliationID": "60068652", "AffiliationName": "Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional (OAN-IGN)"}, "6701810717": {"Name": "Boffin H.M.J.", "AuthorID": "6701810717", "AffiliationID": "60023599", "AffiliationName": "European Southern Observatory"}}}
