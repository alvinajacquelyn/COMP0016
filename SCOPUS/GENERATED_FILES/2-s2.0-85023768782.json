The butanone and cyclohexanone correlations are based on data sets that contain 103 and 72 experimental data points, respectively. The derived correlations for butanone describe the experimental partitioning and solubility behaviour to within a standard deviation of 0.145 log units. A slightly smaller standard deviation of 0.135 was observed between the experimental and back-calculated values for the cyclohexanone solvent correlation equations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham model correlations", "butanone solvent", "cyclohexanone solvent", "partition coefficients", "Solubility ratios"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham model", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "Calculated values", "Correlation equation", "Cyclohexanones", "Nonelectrolyte solutes", "Partition coefficient", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023768782", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57194870112": {"Name": "Tong X.", "AuthorID": "57194870112", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57194871994": {"Name": "Woods D.", "AuthorID": "57194871994", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
