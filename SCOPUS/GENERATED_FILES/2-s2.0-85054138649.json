Although DP is sometimes seen in relatives of patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), mutations in genes known to cause HH that segregate with the trait of familial self-limited DP have not yet been identified. Objective: To assess the contribution of mutations in genes known to cause HH to the phenotype of self-limited DP. Design, Patients, and Setting: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 67 probands and 93 relatives from a large cohort of familial self-limited DP, validated the pathogenicity of the identified gene variant in vitro, and examined the tissue expression and functional requirement of the mouse homolog in vivo. Results: A potentially pathogenic gene variant segregating with DP was identified in 1 of 28 known HH genes examined. This pathogenic variant occurred in HS6ST1 in one pedigree and segregated with the trait in the six affected members with heterozygous transmission (P = 3.01 3 1025). Biochemical analysis showed that this mutation reduced sulfotransferase activity in vitro. Hs6st1 mRNA was expressed in peripubertal wild-type mouse hypothalamus. GnRH neuron counts were similar in Hs6st1+/2 and Hs6st1+/+ mice, but vaginal opening was delayed in Hs6st1+/2 mice despite normal postnatal growth. Conclusions: We have linked a deleterious mutation in HS6ST1 to familial self-limited DP and show that heterozygous Hs6st1 loss causes DP in mice. In this study, the observed overlap in potentially pathogenic mutations contributing to the phenotypes of self-limited DP and HH was limited to this one gene.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Finland", "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Hypogonadism", "Hypothalamus", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Puberty, Delayed", "Sulfotransferases", "Whole Exome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054138649", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56397625300": {"Name": "Howard S.R.", "AuthorID": "56397625300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57191708179": {"Name": "Poliandri A.", "AuthorID": "57191708179", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "54080472900": {"Name": "Ruiz-Babot G.", "AuthorID": "54080472900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602747281": {"Name": "Metherell L.A.", "AuthorID": "6602747281", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57202676747": {"Name": "Guasti L.", "AuthorID": "57202676747", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57202651900": {"Name": "Dunkel L.", "AuthorID": "57202651900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57191746515": {"Name": "Oleari R.", "AuthorID": "57191746515", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan"}, "6507318934": {"Name": "Cariboni A.", "AuthorID": "6507318934", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57204028687": {"Name": "Chantzara V.", "AuthorID": "57204028687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "23007969000": {"Name": "Fantin A.", "AuthorID": "23007969000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57201181791": {"Name": "Cabrera C.P.", "AuthorID": "57201181791", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57217638046": {"Name": "Barnes M.R.", "AuthorID": "57217638046", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "16744466200": {"Name": "Wehkalampi K.", "AuthorID": "16744466200", "AffiliationID": "60000113, 60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki"}}}
