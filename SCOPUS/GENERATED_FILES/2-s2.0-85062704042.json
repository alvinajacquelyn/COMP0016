This is particularly apparent in Portugal where, after nearly half a century of dictatorship ending in 1974, democracy emerged as a central national aspiration, especially within Early Childhood Education (ECE). However, the ambiguity of the term \u201cdemocracy\u201d has allowed policymakers, academics and educators alike to promote diverse understandings of its meaning. This article delves into the ambiguities of democracy, revealing its flexible and context-dependent nature through the diverse representations of democracy encountered in three early years settings in Portugal: a public (state) kindergarten, a not-for-profit kindergarten and a private kindergarten. Using interviews, documentary analysis and observations we illustrate the diverse ways in which democracy is represented in each setting. We classify these representations of democracy as structural, individual and collective. We argue that these reflect the different ideologies of the three types of setting that draw upon particular theoretical understandings and sociopolitical developments in Portugal\u2019s educational history.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Democracy", "early childhood education", "kindergarten", "Portugal", "representations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062704042", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57205398959": {"Name": "Sousa D.", "AuthorID": "57205398959", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Learning and Leadership, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57014912700": {"Name": "Oxley L.", "AuthorID": "57014912700", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "The Careers Group, University of London"}}}
