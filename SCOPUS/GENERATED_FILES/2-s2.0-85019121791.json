Such imagery is diverse, exhibiting high intra-class variation that demands large training data volumes to learn representative classifiers. Unfortunately image annotation at scale is noisy resulting in errors in the training corpus that confound classifier accuracy. We show how evolutionary algorithms may be applied to select a 'purified' subset of the training corpus to optimize classifier performance. We demonstrate our approach over a variety of image descriptors (including deeply learned features) and support vector machines.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classifier performance", "Data purifications", "Image descriptors", "Intra-class variation", "Novel algorithm", "Semantic labeling", "Training corpus", "Training data"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019121791", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"36090016400": {"Name": "James S.", "AuthorID": "36090016400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey"}, "6507799637": {"Name": "Collomosse J.", "AuthorID": "6507799637", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey"}}}
