{"Title": "B cell resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis contributes to their ineffective control by regulatory T cells in rheumatoid arthritis", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Ann. Rheum. Dis.", "Volume": "74", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 294, "PageEnd": 302, "CitedBy": 22, "DOI": "10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204049", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84918527207&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether regulatory T cells (Treg) can control B cell function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and if not to explore the basis for this defect.Methods: Suppression of B cell responses by Treg was analysed in vitro by flow cytometry and ELISA using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 65 patients with RA and 41 sex-matched and aged-matched healthy volunteers. Blocking and agonistic antibodies were used to define the role of Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cell regulation.Results: Treg failed to restrain B cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine and antibody production in the presence of responder T cells in RA patients. This lack of suppression was not only caused by impaired Treg function but was also due to B cell resistance to regulation. In healthy donors, control by Treg was associated with increased B cell death and relied upon Fas-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, RA B cells had reduced Fas expression compared with their healthy counterparts and were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis.Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that Treg are unable to limit B cell responses in RA. This appears to be primarily due to B cell resistance to suppression, but Treg defects also contribute to this failure of regulation. Our data identify the Fas pathway as a novel target for Treg-mediated suppression of B cells and highlight a potential therapeutic approach to restore control of B cells by Treg in RA patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, CD95", "Apoptosis", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "B-Lymphocytes", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918527207", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24478055600": {"Name": "Rapetti L.", "AuthorID": "24478055600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "35073506800": {"Name": "Chavele K.", "AuthorID": "35073506800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "56899209300": {"Name": "Evans C.", "AuthorID": "56899209300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7004262550": {"Name": "Ehrenstein M.", "AuthorID": "7004262550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}}}
