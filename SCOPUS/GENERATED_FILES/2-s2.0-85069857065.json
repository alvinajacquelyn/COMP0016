In particular we compare different possible techniques to detect the particle motion. Key conditions which need to be achieved are extremely low residual pressure and the ability to detect the particle at ultralow power. We compare three different detection approaches based, respectively, on an optical cavity, an optical tweezer, and an electrical readout, and for each one we assess advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cryogenic vacuum", "Detection approach", "Optical cavities", "Particle motions", "Paul trap", "Residual pressures", "Technical challenges", "Ultra-low power"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069857065", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"6603079651": {"Name": "Vinante A.", "AuthorID": "6603079651", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton"}, "57192957414": {"Name": "Rashid M.", "AuthorID": "57192957414", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton"}, "14623577800": {"Name": "Ulbricht H.", "AuthorID": "14623577800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton"}, "23989469900": {"Name": "Pontin A.", "AuthorID": "23989469900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57190953105": {"Name": "Toro\u0161 M.", "AuthorID": "57190953105", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
