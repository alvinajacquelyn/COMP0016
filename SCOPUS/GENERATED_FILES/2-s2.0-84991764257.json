Recent work has provided insight into cortex components and regulators. However, how the network is reorganized in response to cellular signaling, and the role reorganization may play during cell state changes, remain to be determined.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Actins", "Animals", "Cell Shape", "Humans", "Morphogenesis", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991764257", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"12806278100": {"Name": "Chalut K.", "AuthorID": "12806278100", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "11240220400": {"Name": "Paluch E.", "AuthorID": "11240220400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
