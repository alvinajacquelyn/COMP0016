Unfortunately, Christensen's theory relies on far too narrow a conception of both disruption and innovation to be a central framework for thinking about low-carbon transitions. It is better understood as describing one specific mechanism of technological and industrial change that contributes to a broader framework of understanding transitions. It should also be understood as a warning and reminder: businesses, policy analysts and energy modellers alike are prone to overlook potential shifts in user demands, and the technological changes that chase and enable them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy modelling", "Energy transitions", "Innovation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032948133", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"12763822300": {"Name": "McDowall W.", "AuthorID": "12763822300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute and UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources"}}}
