Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is often used to stimulate inflammatory pathways in animal models of infection/inflammation-induced preterm labor; however, inconsistencies in maternal and neonatal responses to LPS are frequently reported. We hypothesized that LPS serotype-specific responses may account for a portion of these inconsistencies. Four different Escherichia coli LPS serotypes (O111:B4, O55:B5, O127:B8, and O128:B12) were administered to CD1 mice via intrauterine injection at gestational day 16. Although control animals delivered at term 60 \u00b1 15 hours postinjection (p.i.), those administered with O111:B4 delivered 7 \u00b1 2 hours p.i., O55:B5 delivered 10 \u00b1 3 hours p.i., O127:B8 delivered 16 \u00b1 10 hours p.i., and O128:B12 delivered 17 \u00b1 2 hours p.i. (means \u00b1 SD). A correlation between the onset of preterm labor and myometrial activation of the inflammatory transcription factor, activator protein 1, but not NF-\u03baB was observed. Specific LPS serotypes induced differential activation of downstream contractile and inflammatory pathways in myometrium and neonatal pup brain. Our findings demonstrate functional disparity in inflammatory pathway activation in response to differing LPS serotypes. Selective use of LPS serotypes may represent a useful tool for targeting specific inflammatory response mechanisms in these models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Escherichia coli", "Female", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Mice", "Myometrium", "Obstetric Labor, Premature", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Premature Birth", "Transcription Factor AP-1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941085494", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"56153064800": {"Name": "Migale R.", "AuthorID": "56153064800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "36194037700": {"Name": "Herbert B.R.", "AuthorID": "36194037700", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "15034496500": {"Name": "Lee Y.S.", "AuthorID": "15034496500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "55175400200": {"Name": "Sykes L.", "AuthorID": "55175400200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "7406603972": {"Name": "Johnson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7406603972", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7402760935": {"Name": "Bennett P.R.", "AuthorID": "7402760935", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "11739957000": {"Name": "MacIntyre D.A.", "AuthorID": "11739957000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "7003698645": {"Name": "Waddington S.N.", "AuthorID": "7003698645", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Antiviral Gene Therapy Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witswatersrand"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102850024": {"Name": "Hagberg H.", "AuthorID": "7102850024", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, Centre for the Developing Brain, King's College London, King's Health Partners, St. Thomas' Hospital"}}}
