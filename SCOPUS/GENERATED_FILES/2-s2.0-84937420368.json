The crucial component is to provide precise and timely weed maps via weed monitoring. This paper compares different approaches for weed mapping using imagery from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in sunflower crops. We explore different alternatives, such as object-based analysis, which is a strategy that is spreading rapidly in the field of remote sensing. The usefulness of these approaches is tested by considering support vector machines, one of the most popular machine learning classifiers. The results show that the object-based analysis is more promising than the pixel-based one and demonstrate that both the features related to vegetation indexes and those related to the shape of the objects are meaningful for the problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Image segmentation", "Object-based analysis", "Support vector machines", "Unmanned Aerial vehicles", "Weed mapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Control treatments", "Environmental risks", "Experimental comparison", "Object-based analysis", "Precision Agriculture", "Site-specific", "Vegetation index", "Weed mappings"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937420368", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60023005, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Agriculture, CSIC"}, "8908632800": {"Name": "Pe\u00f1a J.", "AuthorID": "8908632800", "AffiliationID": "60023005, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Agriculture, CSIC"}, "55614963700": {"Name": "Torres-S\u00e1nchez J.", "AuthorID": "55614963700", "AffiliationID": "60023005, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Agriculture, CSIC"}, "55879881000": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Granados F.", "AuthorID": "55879881000", "AffiliationID": "60023005, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Agriculture, CSIC"}, "23473354200": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez P.", "AuthorID": "23473354200", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603240334": {"Name": "Herv\u00e1s-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "6603240334", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}}}
