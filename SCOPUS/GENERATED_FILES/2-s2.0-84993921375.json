Genetics also plays a role in ovarian cancer, which is partly attributable to 18 confirmed ovarian cancer susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies. The interplay among these loci, ET use and ovarian cancer risk has yet to be evaluated. We analyzed data from 1,414 serous cases, 337 endometrioid cases and 4,051 controls across 10 case\u2013control studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the association between the confirmed susceptibility variants and risk of serous and endometrioid ovarian cancer among ET users and non-users separately and to test for statistical interaction. A splicing variant in TERT, rs10069690, showed a statistically significant interaction with ET use for risk of serous ovarian cancer (pint = 0.013). ET users carrying the T allele had a 51% increased risk of disease (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.91), which was stronger for long-term ET users of 10+ years (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.28\u20132.66, pint = 0.034). Non-users showed essentially no association (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.96\u20131.21). Two additional genomic regions harboring rs7207826 (C allele) and rs56318008 (T allele) also had significant interactions with ET use for the endometrioid histotype (pint = 0.021 and pint = 0.037, respectively). Hence, three confirmed susceptibility variants were identified whose associations with ovarian cancer risk are modified by ET exposure; follow-up is warranted given that these interactions are not adjusted for multiple comparisons. These findings, if validated, may elucidate the mechanism of action of these loci.", "AuthorKeywords": ["estrogen", "gene\u2013environment interactions", "hormone therapy", "ovarian cancer", "SNPs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "Alternative Splicing", "Case-Control Studies", "Disease Susceptibility", "Estrogen Replacement Therapy", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Menopause", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Population Surveillance", "Risk", "Telomerase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84993921375", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55477275900": {"Name": "Lee A.W.", "AuthorID": "55477275900", "AffiliationID": "60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine"}, "56406599000": {"Name": "Wu A.H.", "AuthorID": "56406599000", "AffiliationID": "60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine"}, "7103159684": {"Name": "Pike M.C.", "AuthorID": "7103159684", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "56785534100": {"Name": "Stram D.O.", "AuthorID": "56785534100", "AffiliationID": "60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine"}, "7101785766": {"Name": "Pearce C.L.", "AuthorID": "7101785766", "AffiliationID": "60016660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health"}, "55433891800": {"Name": "Bomkamp A.", "AuthorID": "55433891800", "AffiliationID": "60016660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health"}, "7202760576": {"Name": "Mukherjee B.", "AuthorID": "7202760576", "AffiliationID": "60016660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health"}, "6602672613": {"Name": "Bandera E.V.", "AuthorID": "6602672613", "AffiliationID": "60011889", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Prevention and Control, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey"}, "7403021069": {"Name": "Jensen A.", "AuthorID": "7403021069", "AffiliationID": "60017743", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center"}, "55664209200": {"Name": "Kjaer S.K.", "AuthorID": "55664209200", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7003756888": {"Name": "Hogdall E.", "AuthorID": "7003756888", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60017814", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Unit, Department of Pathology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004611305": {"Name": "Ramus S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004611305", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "University of New South Wales"}, "7401997536": {"Name": "Goodman M.T.", "AuthorID": "7401997536", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Community and Population Health Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "57207897043": {"Name": "Rossing M.A.", "AuthorID": "57207897043", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington"}, "57195388268": {"Name": "Modugno F.", "AuthorID": "57195388268", "AffiliationID": "60026906, 60029883", "AffiliationName": "Womens Cancer Research Program, Magee-Womens Research Institute and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute"}, "7004244859": {"Name": "Moysich K.B.", "AuthorID": "7004244859", "AffiliationID": "60022577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, Roswell Park Cancer Institute"}, "7006409966": {"Name": "Chang-Claude J.", "AuthorID": "7006409966", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH), University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "57190092965": {"Name": "Rudolph A.", "AuthorID": "57190092965", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "16205135000": {"Name": "Gentry-Maharaj A.", "AuthorID": "16205135000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57016315800": {"Name": "Terry K.L.", "AuthorID": "57016315800", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.H.
