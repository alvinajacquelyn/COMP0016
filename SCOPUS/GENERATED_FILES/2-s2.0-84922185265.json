Geometric and vibrational data suggest that metal\u2192N2 charge transfer maximises at the protactinium systems, which feature the longest N-N bonds and the smallest \u03c3(N-N), as a result of partial population of the N-N \u03c0\u2217 orbitals. There is very strong correlation of the standard quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) metrics-bond critical point \u03c1, \u22072\u03c1 and H and delocalisation indices-with An-N and N-N bond lengths and \u03c3(N-N), but the correlation with An-N interaction energies is very poor. A similar situation exists for the other systems studied; neutral and cationic actinide monoxide and dioxides, and AnL3+ and AnL33+ (L = pyridine (Py), pyrazine (Pz) and triazine (Tz)) with the exception of some of the \u22072\u03c1 data, for which moderate to good correlations with energy data are sometimes seen. By contrast, in almost all cases there is very strong correlation of interaction and bond energies with \u0394QQTAIMAn, a simple QTAIM metric which measures the amount of charge transferred to or from the actinide on compound formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actinide elements", "Bond critical points", "Compound formation", "Good correlations", "Interaction energies", "Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules", "Relativistic density functional theory", "Strong correlation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922185265", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56501027800": {"Name": "Huang Q.", "AuthorID": "56501027800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56501767500": {"Name": "Kingham J.", "AuthorID": "56501767500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004509648": {"Name": "Kaltsoyannis N.", "AuthorID": "7004509648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
