Tissue engineering using decellularized or synthetic tracheal scaffolds offers a new avenue for airway reconstruction. Decellularized human donor tracheal scaffolds have been applied in compassionate-use clinical cases but naturally derived extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds demand lengthy preparation times. Here, we compare a clinically applied detergent-enzymatic method (DEM) with an accelerated vacuum-assisted decellularization (VAD) protocol. We examined the histological appearance, DNA content and extracellular matrix composition of human donor tracheae decellularized using these techniques. Further, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and biomechanical testing to analyze decellularization performance. To assess the biocompatibility of scaffolds generated using VAD, we seeded scaffolds with primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro and performed in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and subcutaneous implantation assays. Both DEM and VAD protocols produced well-decellularized tracheal scaffolds with no adverse mechanical effects and scaffolds retained the capacity for in vitro and in vivo cellular integration. We conclude that the substantial reduction in time required to produce scaffolds using VAD compared to DEM (approximately 9 days vs. 3\u20138 weeks) does not compromise the quality of human tracheal scaffold generated. These findings might inform clinical decellularization techniques as VAD offers accelerated scaffold production and reduces the associated costs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epithelial cells", "Tissue engineering", "Tissue scaffolds", "Trachea", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical testing", "Chick chorioallantoic membrane", "Epithelial cells", "Extracellular matrices", "Mechanical effects", "Substantial reduction", "Tissue scaffolds", "Trachea", "Cell Fractionation", "Cell-Free System", "Cells, Cultured", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Extracellular Matrix", "Humans", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Trachea", "Vacuum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012065418", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"26421052200": {"Name": "Butler C.R.", "AuthorID": "26421052200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55503347900": {"Name": "Hynds R.E.", "AuthorID": "55503347900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "54383218900": {"Name": "Gowers K.H.C.", "AuthorID": "54383218900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56284267000": {"Name": "Hamilton N.J.", "AuthorID": "56284267000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "16481042900": {"Name": "Plat\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "16481042900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "54392763900": {"Name": "Crowley C.", "AuthorID": "54392763900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "34973630700": {"Name": "Samuel E.R.", "AuthorID": "34973630700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "35483335400": {"Name": "Burns A.J.", "AuthorID": "35483335400", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus MC"}, "35076756500": {"Name": "Urbani L.", "AuthorID": "35076756500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "15842191500": {"Name": "Partington L.", "AuthorID": "15842191500", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and University College London"}, "57136215200": {"Name": "Carvalho C.", "AuthorID": "57136215200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and University College London"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and University College London"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60029890, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, The Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}}}
