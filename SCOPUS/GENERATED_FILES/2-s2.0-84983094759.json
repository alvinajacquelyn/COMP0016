Our proposed method first combines the basis expansion model (BEM) and the inter symbol interference (ISI) cancellation to overcome the situation that exists with the fast time-varying channel and the normalized maximum multipath channel exceeding the length of the cyclic prefix (CP). At first, the channel estimation and signal detection can be approximated without considering the ISI. Then, the channel parameters and signal detection are updated through ISI cancellation and circular convolution reconstruction from the frequency domain. The simulations show the algorithm can improve the performance of channel estimation and signal detection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BEM", "Channel estimation", "Circular convolution reconstruction", "Complexity", "Doubly-selective channel", "ISI cancellation", "Signal detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["BEM", "Circular convolutions", "Complexity", "Doubly selective channel", "ISI cancellation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983094759", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56285517300": {"Name": "Song L.", "AuthorID": "56285517300", "AffiliationID": "60016318", "AffiliationName": "Chengdu University of Information Technology"}, "8928381100": {"Name": "Lei X.", "AuthorID": "8928381100", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "8646652300": {"Name": "Jin M.", "AuthorID": "8646652300", "AffiliationID": "60102085", "AffiliationName": "Business School of Sichuan University Chengdu"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
