However, due to the complexity of pharmacokinetic experiments, their use is limited in academia. We present a novel surgical rat model for investigation of pharmacokinetic parameters and its use in an anti-obesity drug development program. Materials and methods: The model uses anesthetized male Wistar rats, a jugular, a femoral catheter, and an insulin pump for peptide infusion. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were measured: metabolic clearance rate (MCR), half-life, and volume of distribution (Vd). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucagon (GCG), and exendin-4 (Ex-4) were used to validate the model. The pharmacokinetic parameters of anti-obesity drug candidates X1, X2, and X3 were measured. Results: GLP-1 had a significantly higher MCR (83.9 \u00b1 14.1 mL/min/kg) compared to GCG (40.7 \u00b1 14.3 mL/min/kg) and Ex-4 (10.1 \u00b1 2.5 mL/min/kg) (p <.01 and p <.001 respectively). Ex-4 had a statistically significant longer half-life (35.1 \u00b1 7.4 min) compared to both GCG (3.2 \u00b1 1.7 min) and GLP-1 (1.2 \u00b1 0.4 min) (p <.01 for both GCG and GLP-1). Ex-4 had a statistically significant higher volume of distribution (429.7 \u00b1 164.9 mL/kg) compared to both GCG (146.8 \u00b1 49.6 mL/kg) and GLP-1 (149.7 \u00b1 53.5 mL/kg) (p <.01 for both GCG and GLP-1). Peptide X3 had a statistically significant longer half-life (21.3 \u00b1 3.5 min) compared to both X1 (3.9 \u00b1 0.4 min) and X2 (16.1 \u00b1 2.8 min) (p <.001 for both X1 and X2). Conclusions: We present an affordable and easily accessible platform for the measurement of PK parameters of peptides. This novel surgical rat model produces consistent and reproducible results while minimizing animal use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug", "femoral vein", "half-life", "jugular vein", "metabolic clearance rate", "pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Male", "Models, Animal", "Peptides", "Rats, Wistar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989261656", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"24484704300": {"Name": "Christakis I.", "AuthorID": "24484704300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigative Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, Imperial College London"}, "55595388200": {"Name": "Scott R.", "AuthorID": "55595388200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigative Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, Imperial College London"}, "14071786100": {"Name": "Minnion J.", "AuthorID": "14071786100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigative Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, Imperial College London"}, "24079923900": {"Name": "Cuenco J.", "AuthorID": "24079923900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigative Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, Imperial College London"}, "7402022077": {"Name": "Tan T.", "AuthorID": "7402022077", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigative Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, Imperial College London"}, "36471613400": {"Name": "Bloom S.", "AuthorID": "36471613400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigative Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, Imperial College London"}, "7004552023": {"Name": "Palazzo F.", "AuthorID": "7004552023", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thyroid and Endocrine Surgery, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
