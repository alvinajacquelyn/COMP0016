Home parenteral nutrition is not included but will be addressed in a separate ESPEN guideline. This guideline will also inform interested patients requiring HEN. The guideline is based on current evidence and expert opinion and consists of 61 recommendations that address the indications for HEN, relevant access devices and their use, the products recommended, the monitoring and criteria for termination of HEN, and the structural requirements needed to perform HEN. We searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and single clinical trials based on clinical questions according to the PICO format. The evidence was evaluated and used to develop clinical recommendations implementing the SIGN method. The guideline was commissioned and financially supported by ESPEN and the members of the guideline group were selected by ESPEN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enteral formula", "Home enteral nutrition", "Monitoring", "Nutrition support team", "Tube feeding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067945149", "SubjectAreas": [["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57185128700": {"Name": "Bischoff S.C.", "AuthorID": "57185128700", "AffiliationID": "60018373", "AffiliationName": "University of Hohenheim, Institute of Nutritional Medicine"}, "34976257600": {"Name": "Austin P.", "AuthorID": "34976257600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "25621394300": {"Name": "Boeykens K.", "AuthorID": "25621394300", "AffiliationID": "60094343", "AffiliationName": "AZ Nikolaas Hospital, Nutrition Support Team"}, "34879581900": {"Name": "Chourdakis M.", "AuthorID": "34879581900", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "8276234200": {"Name": "Cuerda C.", "AuthorID": "8276234200", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Nutrition Unit"}, "6505990897": {"Name": "Jonkers-Schuitema C.", "AuthorID": "6505990897", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam University Medical Center Location AMC"}, "57209509698": {"Name": "Lichota M.", "AuthorID": "57209509698", "AffiliationID": "122754880", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Patients Association \u201cAppetite for Life\u201d"}, "6603267715": {"Name": "Nyulasi I.", "AuthorID": "6603267715", "AffiliationID": "60006925, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Department of Rehabilitation, Nutrition and Sport, Latrobe University;, Department of Medicine, Monash University"}, "7401903585": {"Name": "Schneider S.M.", "AuthorID": "7401903585", "AffiliationID": "60030964, 60110693", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"}, "12770421000": {"Name": "Stanga Z.", "AuthorID": "12770421000", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60010987", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern"}, "7004251637": {"Name": "Pironi L.", "AuthorID": "7004251637", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Intestinal Failure, St. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital"}}}
