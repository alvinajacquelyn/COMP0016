However, research has not yet elucidated whether such an association is grounded in mental processes occurring at an intrapersonal (internal) level. In two experiments we examined whether the thermal-emotional associations can be observed at an intrapersonal level. We looked at the speed and accuracy of stimuli categorization. Experiment 1 examined the implicit semantic association between temperature (warm versus cold) and emotional valence (positive versus negative). Experiment 2 examined the association between experience of physical temperature and emotional valence. In both experiments warm-positive/cold-negative associations were demonstrated. These results suggest a conceptual and perceptual mapping in the mental representation of emotion and temperature, which occurs at an intrapersonal level, and which might serve as the ground to the interpersonal thermal-emotional interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embodiment", "Emotional responses", "Implicit associations", "Thermal perception", "Thermal-emotional interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Physical Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Semantics", "Temperature", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921542834", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"35739665700": {"Name": "Bergman P.", "AuthorID": "35739665700", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "13406928500": {"Name": "Ho H.", "AuthorID": "13406928500", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation"}, "37031320000": {"Name": "Koizumi A.", "AuthorID": "37031320000", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University"}, "23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Center, University College London"}, "35792260000": {"Name": "Kitagawa N.", "AuthorID": "35792260000", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation"}}}
