Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the regional ethics committee. All patients gave fully informed written consent. Forty patients with a clinical indication for liver biopsy were prospectively recruited for liver ECV quantitation at equilibrium CT imaging. Biopsy samples underwent digital image analysis and assessment of collagen content expressed as the collagen-proportionate area (CPA). Spearman correlation was used to evaluate association between ECV, ELF, and CPA. Multiple regression analysis was used to test prediction of CPA by a model that combined ECV and ELF. ECV, ELF score, and CPA were compared with Ishak stage by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Complete ECV, ELF, and CPA were available in 33 patients. Liver ECV, CPA, and ELF had a median of 0.26 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.24-0.29), 5.0 (IQR, 3.0-15.0), and 9.71 (IQR, 8.14-10.92), respectively. Hepatic ECV demonstrated good association with CPA (r = 0.64; P <.001) and ELF score (r = 0.38; P <.027)< with no significant difference in strength of correlation (P =.177). The regression model that combined ELF and ECV achieved good prediction of CPA (R2 = 0.67; P <.001). Significant variation in ECV and ELF was seen between fibrosis stage groups. Conclusion: Hepatic ECV measured with equilibrium CT imaging is associated with biopsy-derived CPA and serum ELF-validated markers of liver fibrosis. This suggests that equilibrium CT imaging can quantify diffuse fibrosis in chronic liver disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biopsy", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Humans", "Iohexol", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926468587", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.M.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57220873579": {"Name": "Hall A.R.", "AuthorID": "57220873579", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "7101606450": {"Name": "Dhillon A.", "AuthorID": "7101606450", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}}}
