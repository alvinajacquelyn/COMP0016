Overall, TCR-modified T cells have the ability to target a wide variety of self and non\u2013self targets through the normal biology of a T cell. Although major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\u2013restricted and dependent on co-receptors, genetically engineered TCRs still present a number of characteristics that ensure they are an important alternative strategy to chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and high-affinity TCRs can now be successfully engineered with the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse events. This review will focus on the main characteristics of TCR gene-modified cells, their potential clinical application and promise to the field of adoptive cell transfer (ACT), basic manufacturing procedures and characterization protocols and overall challenges that need to be overcome so that redirection of TCR specificity may be successfully translated into clinical practice, beyond early-phase clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adoptive cell therapy", "gene therapy", "immunotherapy", "T-cell receptor\u2013modified cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Cell Survival", "Gene Editing", "Genes, T-Cell Receptor", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Lentivirus", "Neoplasms", "Protein Engineering", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059863813", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57208115765": {"Name": "Tendeiro Rego R.", "AuthorID": "57208115765", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene & Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.C.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology"}}}
