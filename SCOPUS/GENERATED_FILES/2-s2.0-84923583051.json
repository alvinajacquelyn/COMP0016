All Rights Reserved.Progress in understanding the pathophysiology, and providing novel treatments for glaucoma is dependent on good animal models of the disease. We present here a protocol for elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) in the rat, by injecting magnetic microspheres into the anterior chamber of the eye. The use of magnetic particles allows the user to manipulate the beads into the iridocorneal angle, thus providing a very effective blockade of fluid outflow from the trabecular meshwork. This leads to long-lasting IOP rises, and eventually neuronal death in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) as well as optic nerve pathology, as seen in patients with the disease. This method is simple to perform, as it does not require machinery, specialist surgical skills, or many hours of practice to perfect. Furthermore, the pressure elevations are very robust, and reinjection of the magnetic microspheres is not usually required unlike in some other models using plastic beads. Additionally, we believe this method is suitable for adaptation for the mouse eye.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal model", "Apoptosis", "Degeneration", "Eye", "Glaucoma", "Intraocular pressure", "Issue 96", "Magnetic beads", "Medicine", "Neuron", "Optic nerve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Injections", "Intraocular Pressure", "Magnetics", "Mice", "Microspheres", "Neurons", "Optic Nerve", "Rats", "Tonometry, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923583051", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"56529207500": {"Name": "Bunker S.", "AuthorID": "56529207500", "AffiliationID": "115020784", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, University College College Institue of Ophthalmology"}, "56529708900": {"Name": "Holeniewska J.", "AuthorID": "56529708900", "AffiliationID": "115020784", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, University College College Institue of Ophthalmology"}, "7004710153": {"Name": "Shima D.", "AuthorID": "7004710153", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Hoffman-La Roche, Roche"}, "56362888900": {"Name": "Foxton R.", "AuthorID": "56362888900", "AffiliationID": "115020784", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, University College College Institue of Ophthalmology"}, "36151639200": {"Name": "Vijay S.", "AuthorID": "36151639200", "AffiliationID": "115020784", "AffiliationName": "University College College Institue of Ophthalmology"}, "22950013600": {"Name": "Dahlmann-Noor A.", "AuthorID": "22950013600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202469996": {"Name": "Ng Y.S.", "AuthorID": "7202469996", "AffiliationID": "60028842, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School"}}}
