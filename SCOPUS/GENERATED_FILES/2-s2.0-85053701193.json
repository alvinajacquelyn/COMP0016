Methods: Bespoke MRI techniques, combining a rich diffusion protocol, anatomical data and T2* mapping together with a multi-modal pipeline including motion correction and extracted quantitative features were developed and employed on pregnant women between 22 and 38 weeks gestational age including two pregnancies diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. Results: A multi-faceted assessment was demonstrated showing trends of increasing lacunarity, and decreasing T2* and diffusivity over gestation. Conclusions: The obtained multi-modal acquisition and quantification shows promising opportunities for studying evolution, adaptation and compensation processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["development", "diffusion MRI", "placenta", "postprocessing", "pregnancy complications", "relaxometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["development", "Diffusion mris", "placenta", "postprocessing", "pregnancy complications", "Relaxometry", "Algorithms", "Anisotropy", "Artifacts", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Fetus", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Least-Squares Analysis", "Models, Anatomic", "Motion", "Placenta", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053701193", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55332244600": {"Name": "Hutter J.", "AuthorID": "55332244600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London"}, "56609734100": {"Name": "Jackson L.", "AuthorID": "56609734100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London"}, "57202376469": {"Name": "Gomes A.D.S.", "AuthorID": "57202376469", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London"}, "35759752100": {"Name": "Story L.", "AuthorID": "35759752100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Academic Centre, King's College London"}, "35794139300": {"Name": "O\u2019Muircheartaigh J.", "AuthorID": "35794139300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King's College London"}, "57193009595": {"Name": "Teixeira R.P.A.G.", "AuthorID": "57193009595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London"}, "55165088800": {"Name": "Rutherford M.A.", "AuthorID": "55165088800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King's College London"}, "57205933336": {"Name": "Hajnal J.V.", "AuthorID": "57205933336", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London"}, "56989806800": {"Name": "Slator P.J.", "AuthorID": "56989806800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203945174": {"Name": "Ho A.", "AuthorID": "57203945174", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Academic Centre, King's College London"}, "56240206400": {"Name": "Chappell L.C.", "AuthorID": "56240206400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Academic Centre, King's College London"}}}
