Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseA hallmark of macroautophagy is the covalent lipidation of LC3 and insertion into the double-membrane phagophore, which is driven by the ATG16L1/ATG5-ATG12 complex. In contrast, non-canonical autophagy is a pathway through which LC3 is lipidated and inserted into single membranes, particularly endolysosomal vacuoles during cell engulfment events such as LC3-associated phagocytosis. Factors controlling the targeting of ATG16L1 to phagophores are dispensable for non-canonical autophagy, for which the mechanism of ATG16L1 recruitment is unknown. Here we show that the WD repeat-containing C-terminal domain (WD40 CTD) of ATG16L1 is essential for LC3 recruitment to endolysosomal membranes during non-canonical autophagy, but dispensable for canonical autophagy. Using this strategy to inhibit non-canonical autophagy specifically, we show a reduction of MHC class II antigen presentation in dendritic cells from mice lacking the WD40 CTD. Further, we demonstrate activation of non-canonical autophagy dependent on the WD40 CTD during influenza A virus infection. This suggests dependence on WD40 CTD distinguishes between macroautophagy and non-canonical use of autophagy machinery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATG16L1", "autophagy", "influenza", "LC3", "phagocytosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Carrier Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Dendritic Cells", "Endosomes", "Female", "Humans", "Influenza A virus", "Influenza, Human", "Intracellular Membranes", "Lysosomes", "Membrane Lipids", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "WD40 Repeats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040175487", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57200207910": {"Name": "Fletcher K.", "AuthorID": "57200207910", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Signalling Programme, Babraham Institute"}, "55204775700": {"Name": "Jacquin E.", "AuthorID": "55204775700", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Signalling Programme, Babraham Institute"}, "6508344275": {"Name": "Florey O.", "AuthorID": "6508344275", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Signalling Programme, Babraham Institute"}, "57218121696": {"Name": "Ulferts R.", "AuthorID": "57218121696", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "57220364224": {"Name": "Veith T.", "AuthorID": "57220364224", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "9744154400": {"Name": "Beale R.", "AuthorID": "9744154400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "8695882700": {"Name": "Gammoh N.", "AuthorID": "8695882700", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "40260934700": {"Name": "Arasteh J.M.", "AuthorID": "40260934700", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, UEA"}, "7004081585": {"Name": "Wileman T.", "AuthorID": "7004081585", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, UEA"}, "7102531884": {"Name": "Mayer U.", "AuthorID": "7102531884", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, UEA"}, "7006679498": {"Name": "Carding S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006679498", "AffiliationID": "60176145, 60018654", "AffiliationName": "Quadrum Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park"}}}
