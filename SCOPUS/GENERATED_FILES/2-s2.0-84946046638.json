In this paper we study the variations in the characteristics of currents flowing in this compressed region ahead of the DF, particularly the changes in the cross-tail current, using observations from the THEMIS satellites. Since we do not know whether the changes in the cross-tail current lead to a field-aligned current formation or just form a current loop in the magnetosphere, we thus use redistribution to represent these changes of local current density. We found that (1) the redistribution of the cross-tail current is a common feature preceding DFs; (2) the redistribution of cross-tail current is caused by plasma pressure gradient ahead of the DF and (3) the resultant net current redistributed by a DF is an order of magnitude smaller than the typical total current associated with a moderate substorm current wedge (SCW). Moreover, our results also suggest that the redistributed current ahead of the DF is closed by currents on the DF itself, forming a closed current loop around peaks in plasma pressure, what is traditionally referred to as a banana current.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946046638", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55614530100": {"Name": "Yao Z.H.", "AuthorID": "55614530100", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7202893081": {"Name": "Owen C.J.", "AuthorID": "7202893081", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "23488620900": {"Name": "Forsyth C.", "AuthorID": "23488620900", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "55851738800": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "55851738800", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, University of California"}, "37099686200": {"Name": "Chu X.N.", "AuthorID": "37099686200", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, University of California"}, "7006788329": {"Name": "Pu Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "7006788329", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "14920116400": {"Name": "Zhou X.Z.", "AuthorID": "14920116400", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "55317746800": {"Name": "Guo R.L.", "AuthorID": "55317746800", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "34874814000": {"Name": "Fu H.S.", "AuthorID": "34874814000", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Institute, School of Astronautics, Beihang University"}, "13605264100": {"Name": "Shi Q.Q.", "AuthorID": "13605264100", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "24471514300": {"Name": "Du A.M.", "AuthorID": "24471514300", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
