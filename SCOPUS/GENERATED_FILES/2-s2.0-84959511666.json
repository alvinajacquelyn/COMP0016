A concurrent national drive was aimed at building robust paediatric nephrology networks to ensure services cater for the needs of the family and minimise time away from home. We aimed to identify current national practice since these changes on behalf of the British Association for Paediatric Nephrology. Methods: All UK paediatric nephrology centres were invited to complete a survey of their biopsy practice, including advance preparation. From 1 January to 30 June 2012, a national prospective audit of renal biopsies was undertaken at participating centres comparing practice with the British Association for Paediatric Nephrology (BAPN) standards and audit results from 2005. Results: Survey results from 11 centres demonstrated increased use of pre-procedure information leaflets (63.6 % vs 45.5 %, P = 0.39) and play preparation (90.9 % vs 9.1 %, P = 0.0001). Audit of 331 biopsies showed a move towards day-case procedures (49.5 % vs 32.9 %, P = 0.17) and reduced major complications (4.5 % vs 10.4 %, P = 0.002). Biopsies with 18-gauge needles had significantly higher mean pass rates (3.2 vs 2.3, P = 0.0008) and major complications (15.3 % vs 3.3 %, P = 0.0015) compared with 16-gauge needles. Conclusions: Percutaneous renal biopsy remains a safe procedure in children, thus improving family-centered service provision in the UK.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complications", "Paediatric", "Renal biopsy", "UK National Standards"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biopsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Kidney", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Medical Audit", "Nephrology", "Patient-Centered Care", "Pediatrics", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Quality Indicators, Health Care", "State Medicine", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959511666", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56941152200": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "56941152200", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Childrens Hospital, Steelhouse Lane"}, "56524680200": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien C.", "AuthorID": "56524680200", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Childrens Hospital, Steelhouse Lane"}, "35621579800": {"Name": "Campion-Smith J.", "AuthorID": "35621579800", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals"}, "50961267500": {"Name": "Hayes W.", "AuthorID": "50961267500", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "6603195727": {"Name": "Inward C.", "AuthorID": "6603195727", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "56941594900": {"Name": "Deal J.E.", "AuthorID": "56941594900", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College NHS Trust"}, "7401932319": {"Name": "Gilbert R.D.", "AuthorID": "7401932319", "AffiliationID": "60021722", "AffiliationName": "Southampton General Hospital"}, "17634939400": {"Name": "Judd B.A.", "AuthorID": "17634939400", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital in Liverpool"}, "12796573500": {"Name": "Krishnan R.G.", "AuthorID": "12796573500", "AffiliationID": "115930272", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Kidney Centre in Cardiff"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital in London"}, "7005876247": {"Name": "Shenoy M.", "AuthorID": "7005876247", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "55509589000": {"Name": "Sinha M.D.", "AuthorID": "55509589000", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "24554288500": {"Name": "Tse Y.", "AuthorID": "24554288500", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6506933117": {"Name": "Tyerman K.", "AuthorID": "6506933117", "AffiliationID": "113020050", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "23492769700": {"Name": "Mallik M.", "AuthorID": "23492769700", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "56861796900": {"Name": "Hussain F.", "AuthorID": "56861796900", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
