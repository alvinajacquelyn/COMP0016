Then we give a Lichnerowicz type lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the f-Laplacian on a compact manifold with positive m-Bakry\u2013\u00c9mery Ricci curvature, and prove that the lower bound is achieved only if the manifold is isometric to the n-sphere, or the n-dimensional hemisphere. Finally, for a compact manifold with positive m-Bakry\u2013\u00c9mery Ricci curvature and f-mean convex boundary, we prove an upper bound for the distance function to the boundary, and the upper bound is achieved if and only if the manifold is isometric to a Euclidean ball.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eigenvalue estimate", "f-Mean curvature", "f-Minimal", "m-Bakry\u2013\u00c9mery Ricci curvature"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84881358027", "SubjectAreas": [["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"35491048300": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "35491048300", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of mathematical sciences, and Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University"}, "55585780100": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "55585780100", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of mathematical sciences, Tsinghua University"}}}
