Although preterm infants on parenteral nutrition (PN) exhibit poor growth, growth pattern of term or near-term infants requiring PN is not well reported. We aimed to investigate this in infants born with gastroschisis. Methods: Retrospective review of all infants with gastroschisis requiring PN treated at a single centre over a 4 year period. Growth and clinical data were retrieved, and weight SDS scores for corrected gestational age calculated. Weight SDS (mean \u00b1 SD) were compared at clinically relevant timepoints and multi-level regression used to model growth trends over time. Main results: During the study period 61 infants with gastroschisis were treated; all were included. Infants were small for gestational age at birth for weight (SDS score \u22120.87 \u00b1 0.85). Weight SDS decreased significantly during the first 10 days of age (mean decrease 0.81 \u00b1 0.56; p < 0.0001) and between birth and discharge (mean decrease 0.81 \u00b1 0.56; p < 0.0001). Despite tolerating full enteral feeds, weight SDS velocity was negative around the time of transition from parenteral to enteral feed. There was evidence of \u2018catch up\u2019 growth between 3 and 6 months of age. Conclusion: Despite nutritional support with PN, infants with gastroschisis demonstrate significant growth failure during the newborn period. Further efforts are required to understand the underlying mechanisms, improve nutritional support and to evaluate the long term consequences of postnatal growth failure in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Gastroschisis", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Infant, Low Birth Weight", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nutritional Support", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066237823", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"7201554532": {"Name": "Hall N.J.", "AuthorID": "7201554532", "AffiliationID": "60021722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children's Hospital"}, "56098660800": {"Name": "Drewett M.", "AuthorID": "56098660800", "AffiliationID": "60021722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children's Hospital"}, "7006354086": {"Name": "Burge D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006354086", "AffiliationID": "60021722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children's Hospital"}, "57205586306": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "57205586306", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
