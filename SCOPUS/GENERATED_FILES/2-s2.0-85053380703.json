This self-directed photo survey provided a useful communication tool between visitors, researchers, conservators and collection care staff. The method generated specific and actionable feedback about the focus of visitors\u2019 attention, their perception of risk in the historic environment and the impact of conservation plans on the visitor experience. Although the non-expert nature of visitors\u2019 observations was clear, there was new insight into what visitors find attractive, alarming or anomalous in a historic house environment. This accessible and inclusive method is potentially easily conducted by staff and volunteers involved in collections care. The results could be used to inform training, prioritisation, presentation and interpretation, as well as conservation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collections management", "Conservation", "decision making", "photo survey", "visitor engagement", "visual methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053380703", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"55710983000": {"Name": "Dillon C.", "AuthorID": "55710983000", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "University College London Qatar"}, "56464308300": {"Name": "Golfomitsou S.", "AuthorID": "56464308300", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Conservation, University of Gothenburg"}, "57203894422": {"Name": "Storey C.", "AuthorID": "57203894422", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "University College London Qatar"}, "20434262600": {"Name": "Lithgow K.", "AuthorID": "20434262600", "AffiliationID": "60108950", "AffiliationName": "National Trust"}}}
