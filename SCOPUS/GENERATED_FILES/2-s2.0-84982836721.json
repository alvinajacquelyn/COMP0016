Methods: This study aimed to develop a population PK model for amisulpride specifically in older people, by combining data from a richly sampled phase 1, single (50 mg) dose study in healthy older people (n = 20, 65\u201379 years), with a clinical dataset obtained during off label, low-dose (25\u201375 mg daily) amisulpride prescribing in older people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) (n = 25, 69\u201392 years), as part of an observational study. Results: After introducing a scaling factor based on body weight, age accounted for 20 % of the inter-individual variability in drug clearance (CL), resulting in a 54 % difference in CL between those aged 65 and those aged 85 years, and higher blood concentrations in older patients. Discussion: These findings argue for the consideration of age and weight-based dose stratification to optimise amisulpride prescribing in older people, particularly in those aged 85 years and above.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Amisulpride", "Antipsychotic", "Elderly", "Population pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Sulpiride"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982836721", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7102635651": {"Name": "Reeves S.", "AuthorID": "7102635651", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "57203554426": {"Name": "D\u2019Antonio F.", "AuthorID": "57203554426", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "55813791900": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "55813791900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "34769841900": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "34769841900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "57190739702": {"Name": "McLachlan E.", "AuthorID": "57190739702", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "56047822300": {"Name": "Brownings S.", "AuthorID": "56047822300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "25824711800": {"Name": "Bertrand J.", "AuthorID": "25824711800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60123665", "AffiliationName": "UMR 1137 IAME INSERM University Paris 7, France and Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "7006831304": {"Name": "Greaves S.", "AuthorID": "7006831304", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56703812100": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "56703812100", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55475229800": {"Name": "Taylor D.", "AuthorID": "55475229800", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
