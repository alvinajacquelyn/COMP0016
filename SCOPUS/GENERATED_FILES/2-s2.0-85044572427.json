This analysis evaluates the psychometric properties of the 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) composite, near activity, and distance activity scores in patients with GA. Design: Reliability and validity study. Methods: Reliability and validity were tested with NEI VFQ-25 data collected from 100 subjects with GA from United States\u2019 sites of the phase 2 Mahalo study of lampalizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01229215). Results: Strong internal consistency and reproducibility were demonstrated for the NEI VFQ-25 composite (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.95; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.86), near activity (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.84; ICC, 0.80), and distance activity (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.84; ICC, 0.84) scores. Convergent validity with the binocular measures, Minnesota Low-Vision Reading Test (MNRead) reading speed and Functional Reading Independence (FRI) index score, was demonstrated for baseline NEI VFQ-25 composite (Pearson correlation [r] = 0.61 and 0.69, respectively), near activities (r = 0.69 and 0.73), and distance activities (r = 0.57 and 0.64) scores. Known-group validity testing for baseline mean NEI VFQ-25 scores (composite, near activities, and distance activities) showed differences between patients with mean maximum MNRead reading speed \u2265 80 vs < 80 words per minute, and between mean FRI index score \u2265 2.5 vs < 2.5 (all P <.0001). Conclusions: Psychometric evidence supports the NEI VFQ-25 as a reliable and valid cross-sectional measure of the impact of GA on patient visual function and vision-related quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Geographic Atrophy", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Intravitreal Injections", "Male", "National Eye Institute (U.S.)", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United States", "Vision Disorders", "Vision, Binocular", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044572427", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "8322758300": {"Name": "Tschosik E.", "AuthorID": "8322758300", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech, Inc"}, "57201390902": {"Name": "Kapre A.", "AuthorID": "57201390902", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech, Inc"}, "7201793519": {"Name": "Varma R.", "AuthorID": "7201793519", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "USC Eye Institute, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "7005055349": {"Name": "Bressler N.M.", "AuthorID": "7005055349", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "8263527700": {"Name": "Kimel M.", "AuthorID": "8263527700", "AffiliationID": "60112053", "AffiliationName": "Evidera"}, "16233195900": {"Name": "Dolan C.", "AuthorID": "16233195900", "AffiliationID": "114492317", "AffiliationName": "CMD Consulting, Inc"}, "57201390974": {"Name": "Silverman D.", "AuthorID": "57201390974", "AffiliationID": "60001946", "AffiliationName": "Roche Products Limited"}}}
