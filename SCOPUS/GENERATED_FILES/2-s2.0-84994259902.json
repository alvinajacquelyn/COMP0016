The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present Keck/MOSFIRE spectra of the diagnostic nebular emission lines [O iii], [O ii], and H\u03b2 for a sample of 15 redshift Ly\u03b1 emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). In conjunction with spectra from other surveys, we confirm earlier indications that LAEs have a much higher [O iii]/[O ii] line ratio than is seen in similar redshift LBGs. By comparing their distributions on a [O iii]/[O ii] versus R23 diagram, we demonstrate that this difference cannot arise solely because of their lower metallicities but most likely is due to a harder ionizing spectrum. Using measures of H\u03b2 and recombination theory, we demonstrate, for a subset of our LAEs, that - the number of Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity - is indeed 0.2-0.5 dex larger than for typical LBGs at similar redshifts. Using photoionization models, we estimate the effect this would have on both [O iii]/[O ii] and R23 and conclude such a hard spectrum can only partially explain such intense line emission. The additional possibility is that such a large [O iii]/[O ii] ratio is in part due to density rather than ionization bound nebular regions, which would imply a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. We discuss how further observations could confirm this possibility. Clearly LAEs with intense [O iii] emission represent a promising analog of those sources with similarly strong lines that are thought to be an important contributor to cosmic reionization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: high-redshift"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994259902", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"45361353500": {"Name": "Nakajima K.", "AuthorID": "45361353500", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004148549": {"Name": "Iwata I.", "AuthorID": "7004148549", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}, "7402897995": {"Name": "Inoue A.", "AuthorID": "7402897995", "AffiliationID": "60024188", "AffiliationName": "College of General Education, Osaka Sangyo University"}, "56530413700": {"Name": "Kusakabe H.", "AuthorID": "56530413700", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo"}, "7005342883": {"Name": "Ouchi M.", "AuthorID": "7005342883", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (WPI), University of Tokyo"}, "9437218600": {"Name": "Robertson B.", "AuthorID": "9437218600", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California"}}}
