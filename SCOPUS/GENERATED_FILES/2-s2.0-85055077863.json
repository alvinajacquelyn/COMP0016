In zebrafish, melanocytes, iridophores and xanthophores, the three chromatophore lineages, are thought to share progenitors and so lend themselves to investigating the complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying fate segregation of NC progenitors. Although the core GRN governing melanocyte specification has been previously established, those guiding iridophore and xanthophore development remain elusive. Here we focus on the iridophore GRN, where mutant phenotypes identify the transcription factors Sox10, Tfec and Mitfa and the receptor tyrosine kinase, Ltk, as key players. Here we present expression data, as well as loss and gain of function results, guiding the derivation of an initial iridophore specification GRN. Moreover, we use an iterative process of mathematical modelling, supplemented with a Monte Carlo screening algorithm suited to the qualitative nature of the experimental data, to allow for rigorous predictive exploration of the GRN dynamics. Predictions were experimentally evaluated and testable hypotheses were derived to construct an improved version of the GRN, which we showed produced outputs consistent with experimentally observed gene expression dynamics. Our study reveals multiple important regulatory features, notably a sox10-dependent positive feedback loop between tfec and ltk driving iridophore specification; the molecular basis of sox10 maintenance throughout iridophore development; and the cooperation between sox10 and tfec in driving expression of pnp4a, a key differentiation gene. We also assess a candidate repressor of mitfa, a melanocyte-specific target of sox10. Surprisingly, our data challenge the reported role of Foxd3, an established mitfa repressor, in iridophore regulation. Our study builds upon our previous systems biology approach, by incorporating physiologically-relevant parameter values and rigorous evaluation of parameter values within a qualitative data framework, to establish for the first time the core GRN guiding specification of the iridophore lineage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Cell Lineage", "Chromatophores", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Mutation", "Neural Crest", "SOXE Transcription Factors", "Stem Cells", "Systems Biology", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055077863", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56204656400": {"Name": "Petratou K.", "AuthorID": "56204656400", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cardiovascular Organogenesis and Regeneration, Faculty of Medicine, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster"}, "6603140842": {"Name": "Subkhankulova T.", "AuthorID": "6603140842", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry and Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Faculty of Science, University of Bath"}, "7004607471": {"Name": "Kelsh R.", "AuthorID": "7004607471", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry and Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Faculty of Science, University of Bath"}, "7201547226": {"Name": "Lister J.", "AuthorID": "7201547226", "AffiliationID": "60027005, 60010966, 60002476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human and Molecular Genetics and Massey Cancer Center, VCU School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University"}, "57195385734": {"Name": "Rocco A.", "AuthorID": "57195385734", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial and Cellular Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7003934390": {"Name": "Schwetlick H.", "AuthorID": "7003934390", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Bath"}}}
