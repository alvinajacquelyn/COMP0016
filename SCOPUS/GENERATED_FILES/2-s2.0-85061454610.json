Based on 40 interviews via a snowballing survey strategy in Yuhuan City, Zhejiang Province, it is shown that rural migrant workers (RMWs) create their own enterprises through social and institutional embeddedness. Rural migrants can benefit from social embeddedness, particularly by developing relationships with local entrepreneurs and managers in local firms and other rural migrant entrepreneurs (RMEs) in their entrepreneurial activities. Further, it is also important for RMEs to embed institutionally in the host region in various ways. RMEs have been inspired by the local entrepreneurial tradition and culture of Yuhuan. In addition, the policies of both the host region and RMEs\u2019 hometowns have impacts on their entrepreneurial activities. Interestingly, RMEs can improve their institutional embeddedness by participating in the joint public governance on RMWs initiated by the hometown government.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061454610", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55489461500": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "55489461500", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Normal University"}, "57193139527": {"Name": "Feng J.", "AuthorID": "57193139527", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Normal University"}, "23478150200": {"Name": "Pan F.", "AuthorID": "23478150200", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Normal University"}}}
