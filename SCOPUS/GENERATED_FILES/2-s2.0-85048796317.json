Fabry disease (FD) is rare but may mimic sarcomeric HCM, and has an adverse prognosis in the absence of specific treatment. We aimed to assess cardiologists\u2019 awareness of FD based on data from the Portuguese Registry of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Methods: A total of 811 index patients, aged 55 \u00b1 16 years, 486 (59.9%) male, were included. Three groups were characterized: A \u2013 128 patients, 74 (57.8%) male, with pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation(s) in sarcomeric genes; B \u2013 234 patients, 146 (62.4%) male, with negative genetic testing; and C \u2013 449 patients, 266 (59.2%) male, no genetic testing performed. The groups were compared in terms of whether FD was excluded in the registry. Potential red flags for FD were also analyzed and compared between groups. Results: Patients in group A were younger and more frequently had familial HCM (A \u2013 53.9% vs. B \u2013 20.1% vs. C \u2013 18.3%; p <0.001). FD was recorded as excluded in 217 (26.8%), similar in all groups; GLA gene testing was performed in only 50/217 patients (A \u2013 48.6%, B \u2013 25.7%, p = 0.019; C \u2013 13.4%, p = 0.036 for B vs. C), mostly in women (p <0.001) in groups B and C. Alpha-galactosidase A (\u03b1-Gal A) activity was assessed in 39/217 (18%) patients, with no difference between groups, but more often in men (p = 0.005). Among patients with potential red flags for FD, only 46.7% underwent specific tests (GLA gene testing and/or \u03b1-Gal A activity). When GLA genotyping was performed no mutations were identified. Conclusions: There is a need to improve cardiologists\u2019 alertness for the identification of FD among the Portuguese HCM population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fabry disease", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Left ventricular hypertrophy", "Registry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiology", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Fabry Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048796317", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7004510538": {"Name": "Brito D.", "AuthorID": "7004510538", "AffiliationID": "60106051, 60021007", "AffiliationName": "Servi\u00e7o de Cardiologia, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHLN, CCUL, Centro Acad\u00e9mico de Medicina de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7004229183": {"Name": "Cardim N.", "AuthorID": "7004229183", "AffiliationID": "60031875", "AffiliationName": "Centro de miocardiopatia hipertr\u00f3fica - Hospital da Luz, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas da Universidade Nova de Lisboa"}, "9846194600": {"Name": "Lopes L.R.", "AuthorID": "9846194600", "AffiliationID": "60106051, 60022148, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiovascular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Institute of Cardiovascular Centre, University College London; Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26030284000": {"Name": "Belo A.", "AuthorID": "26030284000", "AffiliationID": "116874105", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Cole\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados em Cardiologia (CNCDC), Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia"}, "24734134200": {"Name": "Mimoso J.", "AuthorID": "24734134200", "AffiliationID": "100857844", "AffiliationName": "Servi\u00e7o de Cardiologia do CHU Algarve"}, "57200153156": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves L.", "AuthorID": "57200153156", "AffiliationID": "60032962, 60019112", "AffiliationName": "Servi\u00e7o de Cardiologia do CHUC-HG e Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra"}, "7004929005": {"Name": "Madeira H.", "AuthorID": "7004929005", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiovascular da Universidade de Lisboa (CCUL), Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
