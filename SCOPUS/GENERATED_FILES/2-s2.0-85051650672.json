How this occurs remains unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and allelic variation, we show that individual pre-B cells monoallelically transcribe divergent arrays of V\u03ba genes, thereby opening stochastic repertoires for subsequent V\u03ba-J\u03ba recombination. Transcription occurs upon translocation of V\u03ba genes to RNA polymerase II arrayed on the nuclear matrix in transcription factories. Transcription is anchored by CTCF-bound sites or E2A-loaded V\u03ba promotors and continues over large genomic distances delimited only by topological associating domains (TADs). Prior to their monoallelic activation, V\u03ba loci are transcriptionally repressed by cyclin D3, which prevents capture of V\u03ba gene containing TADs by transcription factories. Cyclin D3 also represses protocadherin, olfactory, and other monoallelically expressed genes, suggesting a widely deployed mechanism for coupling monoallelic gene activation with cell cycle exit. The mechanisms controlling V\u03ba transcription and their relationships to Ig\u03ba recombination are obscure. Karki et al. demonstrate that, upon translocation to transcription factories, V\u03ba-gene-containing chromatin loops are transcribed over long distances, which opens large, monoallelic, and diverse V\u03ba repertoires for subsequent V\u03ba-J\u03ba recombination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CTCF", "cyclin D3", "gene accessibility", "germline transcription", "Ig\u03ba repertoire", "monoallelic gene expression", "recombination center", "RNA polymerase II", "TADs", "transcription factories"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Variable Region", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051650672", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56166128100": {"Name": "Karki S.", "AuthorID": "56166128100", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology and The Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, University of Chicago"}, "56665517500": {"Name": "Kennedy D.E.", "AuthorID": "56665517500", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology and The Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, University of Chicago"}, "57203415960": {"Name": "Mclean K.", "AuthorID": "57203415960", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology and The Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, University of Chicago"}, "57197984713": {"Name": "Mandal M.", "AuthorID": "57197984713", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology and The Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, University of Chicago"}, "7404528961": {"Name": "Clark M.R.", "AuthorID": "7404528961", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology and The Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, University of Chicago"}, "45761092700": {"Name": "Grzybowski A.T.", "AuthorID": "45761092700", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago"}, "8519385700": {"Name": "Ruthenburg A.J.", "AuthorID": "8519385700", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago"}, "22941160600": {"Name": "Maienschein-Cline M.", "AuthorID": "22941160600", "AffiliationID": "60027561", "AffiliationName": "Research Resource Center, University of Illinois at Chicago"}, "53363223100": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "53363223100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "55887201400": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "55887201400", "AffiliationID": "60025152", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunobiology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati"}, "35547879800": {"Name": "Singh H.", "AuthorID": "35547879800", "AffiliationID": "60025152", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunobiology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati"}, "34967954800": {"Name": "Davis E.", "AuthorID": "34967954800", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago"}, "35407533900": {"Name": "Le Beau M.M.", "AuthorID": "35407533900", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago"}, "6507847272": {"Name": "Labno C.", "AuthorID": "6507847272", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Integrated Light Microscopy Core Facility, University of Chicago"}, "13006599300": {"Name": "Powers S.E.", "AuthorID": "13006599300", "AffiliationID": "60138941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Lewis University"}, "7004034005": {"Name": "Dinner A.R.", "AuthorID": "7004034005", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "James Frank Institute, University of Chicago"}}}
