We asked how ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (ooDSGCs) in mouse retina acquire their bistratified dendrites, in which responses to light onset and light offset are segregated to distinct strata. We found that the transcriptional regulator Satb1 is selectively expressed by ooDSGCs. In Satb1 mutant mice, ooDSGC dendrites lack ON arbors, and the cells selectively lose ON responses. Satb1 regulates expression of a homophilic adhesion molecule, Contactin 5 (Cntn5). Both Cntn5 and its co-receptor Caspr4 are expressed not only by ooDSGCs, but also by interneurons that form a scaffold on which ooDSGC ON dendrites fasciculate. Removing Cntn5 from either ooDSGCs or interneurons partially phenocopies Satb1 mutants, demonstrating that Satb1-dependent Cntn5 expression in ooDSGCs leads to branch-specific homophilic interactions with interneurons. Thus, Satb1 directs formation of a morphologically and functionally specialized compartment within a complex dendritic arbor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caspr", "Contactin", "dendrite", "direction selectivity", "hemophilic adhesion", "ooDSGC", "retinal ganglion cell", "Satb1", "Satb2", "starburst amacrine cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "beta-Galactosidase", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal", "Contactins", "Dendrites", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "HEK293 Cells", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Luminescent Proteins", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Receptors, Dopamine D4", "Retina", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Transcription Factors", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027220788", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57195331209": {"Name": "Peng Y.", "AuthorID": "57195331209", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Science and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University"}, "7102198265": {"Name": "Tran N.", "AuthorID": "7102198265", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Science and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University"}, "8842409300": {"Name": "Krishnaswamy A.", "AuthorID": "8842409300", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}, "56370127900": {"Name": "Kostadinov D.", "AuthorID": "56370127900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56663255700": {"Name": "Martersteck E.", "AuthorID": "56663255700", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Science and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University"}, "7101618554": {"Name": "Sanes J.", "AuthorID": "7101618554", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Science and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University"}}}
