KGaA, Weinheim The chemistry of phosphorus(III) ligands, which are of key importance in coordination chemistry, organometallic chemistry and catalysis, is dominated by relatively electron-rich species. Many of the electron-poor P III ligands that are readily available have relatively small steric profiles. As such, there is a significant gap in \u201cligand space\u201d where more sterically bulky, electron-poor P III ligands are needed. This contribution discusses the coordination chemistry, steric and electronic properties of P III ligands bearing highly fluorinated alkoxide groups of the general form PR n (OR F ) 3\u2212n , where R=Ph, R F =C(H)(CF 3 ) 2 and C(CF 3 ) 3 ; n=1\u20133. These ligands are simple to synthesize and a range of experimental and theoretical methods suggest that their steric and electronic properties can be \u201ctuned\u201d by modification of their substituents, making them excellent candidates for large, electron-poor ligands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catalysis", "coordination chemistry", "density functional calculations", "ligand design", "phosphorus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkoxides", "Co-ordination chemistries", "Electron-rich", "Ligand design", "Organometallic chemistry", "Theoretical methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059865364", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"54960296200": {"Name": "Hussein S.", "AuthorID": "54960296200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57205390219": {"Name": "Priester D.", "AuthorID": "57205390219", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57205392067": {"Name": "Beet P.", "AuthorID": "57205392067", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57189512233": {"Name": "Cottom J.", "AuthorID": "57189512233", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "14012563700": {"Name": "Hart S.J.", "AuthorID": "14012563700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57205388082": {"Name": "James T.", "AuthorID": "57205388082", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "26656231500": {"Name": "Thatcher R.J.", "AuthorID": "26656231500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "6603883560": {"Name": "Whitwood A.C.", "AuthorID": "6603883560", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "14052965300": {"Name": "Slattery J.M.", "AuthorID": "14052965300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}}}
