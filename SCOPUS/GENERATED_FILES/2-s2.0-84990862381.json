Patients and Methods Patients received tumor doses of 63 to 73 Gy in 30 once-daily fractions over 6 weeks with 2 concurrent cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine. They were assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to esophageal dose. In group 1, tumor doses were determined by an experimental constraint on maximum esophageal dose, which was escalated following a 6 + 6 design from 65 Gy through 68 Gy to 71 Gy, allowing an esophageal maximum tolerated dose to be determined from early and late toxicities. Tumor doses for group 2 patients were determined by other tissue constraints, often lung. Overall survival, progression-free survival, tumor response, and toxicity were evaluated for both groups combined. Results Eight centers recruited 84 patients: 13, 12, and 10, respectively, in the 65-Gy, 68-Gy, and 71-Gy cohorts of group 1; and 49 in group 2. The mean prescribed tumor dose was 67.7 Gy. Five grade 3 esophagitis and 3 grade 3 pneumonitis events were observed across both groups. After 1 fatal esophageal perforation in the 71-Gy cohort, 68 Gy was declared the esophageal maximum tolerated dose. With a median follow-up of 35 months, median overall survival was 36.9 months, and overall survival and progression-free survival were 87.8% and 72.0%, respectively, at 1 year and 68.0% and 48.5% at 2 years. Conclusions IDEAL-CRT achieved significant treatment intensification with acceptable toxicity and promising survival. The isotoxic design allowed the esophageal maximum tolerated dose to be identified from relatively few patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Concurrent chemoradiotherapy", "Concurrent chemotherapy", "Early and late toxicities", "Maximum tolerated dose", "Non small cell lung cancer", "Overall survival", "Progression free survival", "Tumor response", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Comorbidity", "Dose Fractionation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prevalence", "Radiation Injuries", "Survival Rate", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990862381", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"23479629300": {"Name": "Landau D.B.", "AuthorID": "23479629300", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Guy's & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust, King's College London"}, "56468627300": {"Name": "Hughes S.R.", "AuthorID": "56468627300", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Guy's & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust, King's College London"}, "7103113712": {"Name": "Spicer J.", "AuthorID": "7103113712", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Guy's & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust, King's College London"}, "57191472617": {"Name": "Hughes L.", "AuthorID": "57191472617", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "14422144300": {"Name": "Counsell N.", "AuthorID": "14422144300", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "55252474800": {"Name": "Khan I.", "AuthorID": "55252474800", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "55388344300": {"Name": "Ngai Y.", "AuthorID": "55388344300", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "55486883100": {"Name": "Baker A.", "AuthorID": "55486883100", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre"}, "16022194100": {"Name": "Malik Z.", "AuthorID": "16022194100", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre"}, "6507932094": {"Name": "Mayles H.", "AuthorID": "6507932094", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre"}, "10840493300": {"Name": "Mayles W.P.M.", "AuthorID": "10840493300", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre"}, "57204344178": {"Name": "Bates A.T.", "AuthorID": "57204344178", "AffiliationID": "60021722", "AffiliationName": "Southampton General Hospital"}, "7005720093": {"Name": "Bayne M.C.", "AuthorID": "7005720093", "AffiliationID": "60026868", "AffiliationName": "Poole Hospital"}, "57190979332": {"Name": "Laurence V.", "AuthorID": "57190979332", "AffiliationID": "60026868", "AffiliationName": "Poole Hospital"}, "56370715200": {"Name": "Garcia-Alonso A.", "AuthorID": "56370715200", "AffiliationID": "60010389", "AffiliationName": "North Wales Cancer Centre"}, "57193354987": {"Name": "Harden S.V.", "AuthorID": "57193354987", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "57191472463": {"Name": "Hicks J.D.", "AuthorID": "57191472463", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "7006011933": {"Name": "Mohammed N.", "AuthorID": "7006011933", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "6506993001": {"Name": "Illsley M.C.", "AuthorID": "6506993001", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "55277584800": {"Name": "Miles E.", "AuthorID": "55277584800", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "56803431600": {"Name": "Parsons E.", "AuthorID": "56803431600", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "56438870600": {"Name": "Wilkinson D.", "AuthorID": "56438870600", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57190244749": {"Name": "Wells P.", "AuthorID": "57190244749", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "35766390500": {"Name": "Fenwick J.D.", "AuthorID": "35766390500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}}}
