Studies investigating the onset of individual organ injury such as the liver, kidneys and brain during the evolution of acute liver failure, are lacking. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding strands of RNA that are released into the circulation following tissue injury. In this study, we have characterised the release of both global microRNA and specific microRNA species into the plasma using a porcine model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. Pigs were induced to acute liver failure with oral acetaminophen over 19h\u00b12h and death occurred 13h\u00b13h thereafter. Global microRNA concentrations increased 4h prior to acute liver failure in plasma (P<0.0001) but not in isolated exosomes, and were associated with increasing plasma levels of the damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, genomic DNA (P<0.0001). MiR122 increased around the time of onset of acute liver failure (P<0.0001) and was associated with increasing international normalised ratio (P<0.0001). MiR192 increased 8h after acute liver failure (P<0.0001) and was associated with increasing creatinine (P<0.0001). The increase in miR124-1 occurred concurrent with the pre-terminal increase in intracranial pressure (P<0.0001) and was associated with decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure (P<0.002).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Animals", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Disease Models, Animal", "Intracranial Pressure", "Liver Failure, Acute", "MicroRNAs", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958267410", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55989373000": {"Name": "Baker L.A.", "AuthorID": "55989373000", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "55949753800": {"Name": "Lee K.C.L.", "AuthorID": "55949753800", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "55023585400": {"Name": "Jimenez C.P.", "AuthorID": "55023585400", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6602505771": {"Name": "Alibhai H.", "AuthorID": "6602505771", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57188648757": {"Name": "Chang Y.", "AuthorID": "57188648757", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "54901322700": {"Name": "Leckie P.J.", "AuthorID": "54901322700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603672216": {"Name": "Mookerjee R.P.", "AuthorID": "6603672216", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7202610468": {"Name": "Davies N.A.", "AuthorID": "7202610468", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003637169": {"Name": "Andreola F.", "AuthorID": "7003637169", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
