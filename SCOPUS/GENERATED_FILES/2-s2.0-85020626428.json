Understanding longitudinal alterations to white matter may provide new insights into trajectories of brain change in both healthy aging and AD, and fluid biomarkers may be particularly useful in this effort. To examine this, 151 late-middle-aged participants enriched with risk for AD with at least one lumbar puncture and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were selected for analysis from two large observational and longitudinally followed cohorts. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assayed for biomarkers of AD-specific pathology (phosphorylated-tau/A\u03b242 ratio), axonal degeneration (neurofilament light chain protein, NFL), dendritic degeneration (neurogranin), and inflammation (chitinase-3-like protein 1, YKL-40). Linear mixed effects models were performed to test the hypothesis that biomarkers for AD, neurodegeneration, and inflammation, or two-year change in those biomarkers, would be associated with worse white matter health overall and/or progressively worsening white matter health over time. At baseline in the cingulum, phosphorylated-tau/A\u03b242 was associated with higher mean diffusivity (MD) overall (intercept) and YKL-40 was associated with increases in MD over time. Two-year change in neurogranin was associated with higher mean diffusivity and lower fractional anisotropy overall (intercepts) across white matter in the entire brain and in the cingulum. These findings suggest that biomarkers for AD, neurodegeneration, and inflammation are potentially important indicators of declining white matter health in a cognitively healthy, late-middle-aged cohort.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Linear mixed effects", "Longitudinal", "Preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Biomarkers", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Degeneration", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020626428", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55913313600": {"Name": "Racine A.M.", "AuthorID": "55913313600", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "56910527600": {"Name": "Merluzzi A.P.", "AuthorID": "56910527600", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "57197355541": {"Name": "Clark L.R.", "AuthorID": "57197355541", "AffiliationID": "60073942", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, William S.
