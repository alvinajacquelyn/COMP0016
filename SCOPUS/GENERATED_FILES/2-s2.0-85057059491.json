Methods: We collected clinical periodontal parameters, including probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL). Insulin, glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP were measured after 3 days of standardized diet. Results: Forty-seven subjects had periodontitis (PD+) and 63 did not (PD\u2212). PD+ showed 30.3% of gingival sites with PPD > 4 mm, 55.2% of BOP sites and a mean CAL loss of 4.1 mm. Compared with PD\u2212, PD+ had higher glucagon (26.60 [25.22] vs 3.93 [7.50] ng/l, p < 0.0001) and GIP levels (10.56 [13.30] vs 6.43 [8.43] pmol/l, p < 0.001), while GLP-1 was reduced (11.78 [10.07] vs 23.34 [16.80] pmol/l, p < 0.0001). Insulin did not differ. In PD+, after adjustment for confounders, PPD was positively related to glucagon (\u03b2 = 0.424, p = 0.002) and inversely to GLP-1 (\u03b2 = \u22120.159, p = 0.044). Conclusions: We describe for the first time an impaired incretin axis coupled with a relative hyperglucagonemia in obese non-diabetic individuals with PD, that might contribute to deteriorate their glucose tolerance and partially explain the higher risk of diabetes observed in these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Glucose", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide", "Glucagon", "Humans", "Incretins", "Insulin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Morbid", "Periodontitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057059491", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"7006193279": {"Name": "Solini A.", "AuthorID": "7006193279", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular and Critical Area Pathology, University of Pisa"}, "56795016200": {"Name": "Gennai S.", "AuthorID": "56795016200", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular and Critical Area Pathology, University of Pisa"}, "35772984900": {"Name": "Petrini M.", "AuthorID": "35772984900", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular and Critical Area Pathology, University of Pisa"}, "36879606000": {"Name": "Graziani F.", "AuthorID": "36879606000", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular and Critical Area Pathology, University of Pisa"}, "19637686000": {"Name": "Suvan J.", "AuthorID": "19637686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57198744550": {"Name": "D\u2019Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "57198744550", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "8576854900": {"Name": "Santini E.", "AuthorID": "8576854900", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "37035022800": {"Name": "Seghieri M.", "AuthorID": "37035022800", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}}}
