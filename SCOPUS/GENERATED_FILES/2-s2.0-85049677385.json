Objective: The objective of this article is to assess IBS-D patient burden and patient and healthcare professional (HCP) attitudes towards IBS. Methods: Patients and HCPs from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom completed internet-based surveys via market research panels. Attitudes to IBS-D-related statements were scored using seven-point Likert scales. Results: The patient survey included 513 patients (70% female, mean age 40.9 years). Faecal urgency was reported as the most troublesome symptom (27%) and fatigue occurred on the most days per month (mean: 18); 61% of patients used \u22653 types of treatment daily or intermittently; 19% used antidepressants daily. Thirty-three per cent thought HCPs should listen and provide more support and 46% reported willingness to \u2018try anything\u2019 to help manage their IBS\u2013D. The HCP survey included 366 primary care physicians and 313 gastroenterologists: A total of 70% and 65%, respectively, agreed it was important that IBS-D patients feel listened to and supported; 73% agreed their main aim was to improve quality of life; \u223c30% expressed frustration at managing IBS-D. Conclusion: IBS-D imposes a substantial burden on patients and HCPs. These findings point towards a need for improved patient-HCP communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diarrhoea", "faecal urgency", "Irritable bowel syndrome", "psychosocial morbidity", "survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049677385", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7801453693": {"Name": "T\u00f6rnblom H.", "AuthorID": "7801453693", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine & Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57202890309": {"Name": "Goosey R.", "AuthorID": "57202890309", "AffiliationID": "60107256", "AffiliationName": "Kantar Health"}, "57202012788": {"Name": "Wiseman G.", "AuthorID": "57202012788", "AffiliationID": "60107267", "AffiliationName": "Allergan plc"}, "57202890554": {"Name": "Baker S.", "AuthorID": "57202890554", "AffiliationID": "60107267", "AffiliationName": "Allergan plc"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}}}
