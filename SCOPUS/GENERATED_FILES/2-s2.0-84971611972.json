The reproducibility of hippocampal atrophy rate for FSL/FIRST, AdaBoost, FreeSurfer, MAPS independently and MAPS combined with the boundary shift integral (MAPS-HBSI) were calculated. Back-to-back (BTB) 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE MRI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1) study at baseline and year one were used. Analysis on 3 groups of subjects was performed - 562 subjects at 1.5 T, a 75 subject group that also had manual segmentation and 111 subjects at 3 T. A simple and novel statistical test based on the binomial distribution was used that handled outlying data points robustly. Median hippocampal atrophy rates were -1.1%/year for healthy controls, -3.0%/year for mildly cognitively impaired and -5.1%/year for AD subjects. The best reproducibility was observed for MAPS-HBSI (1.3%), while the other methods tested had reproducibilities at least 50% higher at 1.5 T and 3 T which was statistically significant. For a clinical trial, MAPS-HBSI should require less than half the subjects of the other methods tested. All methods had good accuracy versus manual segmentation. The MAPS-HBSI method has substantially better reproducibility than the other methods considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Atrophy", "Automatic segmentation", "Boundary shift integral", "Hippocampus", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Manual segmentation", "Mild cognitive impairment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971611972", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6602813052": {"Name": "Cover K.", "AuthorID": "6602813052", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "6603788231": {"Name": "van Schijndel R.", "AuthorID": "6603788231", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "55634268300": {"Name": "Versteeg A.", "AuthorID": "55634268300", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "56919314800": {"Name": "Mulder E.", "AuthorID": "56919314800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "57189514435": {"Name": "Jong R.", "AuthorID": "57189514435", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "7101761148": {"Name": "Visser P.", "AuthorID": "7101761148", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "6506499076": {"Name": "Vrenken H.", "AuthorID": "6506499076", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "7005183146": {"Name": "van Dijk B.", "AuthorID": "7005183146", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "35275217400": {"Name": "Leung K.", "AuthorID": "35275217400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55913019300": {"Name": "Redolfi A.", "AuthorID": "55913019300", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "57202703811": {"Name": "Bosco P.", "AuthorID": "57202703811", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "56214208300": {"Name": "Frisoni G.", "AuthorID": "56214208300", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60009963", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals and University of Geneva"}, "35072005700": {"Name": "Revillard J.", "AuthorID": "35072005700", "AffiliationID": "110925207", "AffiliationName": "MAAT"}, "57189524152": {"Name": "Grenier B.", "AuthorID": "57189524152", "AffiliationID": "110925207", "AffiliationName": "MAAT"}, "15136212800": {"Name": "Manset D.", "AuthorID": "15136212800", "AffiliationID": "110925207", "AffiliationName": "MAAT"}, "15131375100": {"Name": "Damangir S.", "AuthorID": "15131375100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
