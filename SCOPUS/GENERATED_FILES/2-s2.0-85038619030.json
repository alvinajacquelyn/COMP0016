Little is known about their effects on metabolite and lipoprotein subclass profiles. We, therefore, investigated the molecular changes associated with pravastatin treatment compared with placebo administration using a nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics platform. Methods and Results - We performed metabolic profiling of 231 lipoprotein and metabolite measures in the PREVEND IT (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease Intervention Trial) study, a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial designed to test the effects of pravastatin (40 mg once daily) on cardiovascular risk. Metabolic profiles were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Pravastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (change in SD units [95% confidence interval]: -1.01 [-1.14, -0.88]), remnant cholesterol (change in SD units [95% confidence interval]: -1.03 [-1.17, -0.89]), and apolipoprotein B (change in SD units [95% confidence interval]: -0.98 [-1.11, -0.86]) with similar effect magnitudes. In addition, pravastatin globally lowered levels of lipoprotein subclasses, with the exception of high-density lipoprotein subclasses, which displayed a more heterogeneous response pattern. The lipid-lowering effect of pravastatin was accompanied by selective changes in lipid composition, particularly in the cholesterol content of very-low-density lipoproteinparticles. In addition, pravastatin reduced levels of several fatty acids but had limited effects on fatty acid ratios. Conclusions - These randomized clinical trial data demonstrate the widespread effects of pravastatin treatment on lipoprotein subclass profiles and fatty acids.
