Our technology consists of independent, miniaturized, silicone-encapsulated DOT modules that can be placed directly on the scalp. Four of these modules were arranged to provide up to 128, dual-wavelength measurement channels over a scalp area of approximately 60 \u00d7 65 mm2. Using a series of motor-cortex stimulation experiments, we demonstrate that this system can obtain high-quality, continuous-wave measurements at source-detector separations ranging from 14 to 55 mm in adults, in the presence of hair. We identify robust haemodynamic response functions in 5 out of 5 subjects, and present diffuse optical tomography images that depict functional haemodynamic responses that are well-localized in all three dimensions at both the individual and group levels. This prototype modular system paves the way for a new generation of wearable, wireless, high-density optical neuroimaging technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging systems", "Optoelectronics", "Tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous wave measurements", "Diffuse optical tomography", "Functional images", "Functional imaging of the human brain", "Haemodynamic response", "Motor cortex stimulations", "Source-detector separation", "Three dimensions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990047824", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36466214300": {"Name": "Chitnis D.", "AuthorID": "36466214300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55793189898": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "55793189898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56303480500": {"Name": "Dempsey L.", "AuthorID": "56303480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191431542": {"Name": "Quaggia S.", "AuthorID": "57191431542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55758036200": {"Name": "Highton D.", "AuthorID": "55758036200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004171877": {"Name": "Elwell C.", "AuthorID": "7004171877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004407749": {"Name": "Hebden J.", "AuthorID": "7004407749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "8885609900": {"Name": "Everdell N.", "AuthorID": "8885609900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
