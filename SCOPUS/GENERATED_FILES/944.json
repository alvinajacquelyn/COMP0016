Although improvements in DM and hypertension management have reduced The proportion of diabetic individuals who develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), The sheer increase in people developing DM will have a major impact on dialysis and transplant needs. This KDIGO conference addressed a number of controversial areas in The management of DM patients with CKD, including aspects of screening for CKD with measurements of albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); defining treatment outcomes; glycemic management in both those developing CKD and those with ESRD; hypertension goals and management, including blockers of The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; and lipid management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Albuminuria", "blood pressure", "diabetic kidney disease", "glycemic control", "lipid management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Albuminuria", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Hypertension"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920272288", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"7006152149": {"Name": "Molitch M.E.", "AuthorID": "7006152149", "AffiliationID": "60013227", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}, "7202435862": {"Name": "Adler A.I.", "AuthorID": "7202435862", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospitals"}, "7102228160": {"Name": "Flyvbjerg A.", "AuthorID": "7102228160", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University"}, "7404561092": {"Name": "Nelson R.G.", "AuthorID": "7404561092", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health"}, "7004974019": {"Name": "So W.Y.", "AuthorID": "7004974019", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "57212349814": {"Name": "Wanner C.", "AuthorID": "57212349814", "AffiliationID": "60032515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "56816526700": {"Name": "Kasiske B.L.", "AuthorID": "56816526700", "AffiliationID": "60019146", "AffiliationName": "Hennepin County Medical Center"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7102568501": {"Name": "De Zeeuw D.", "AuthorID": "7102568501", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7102030700": {"Name": "Mogensen C.E.", "AuthorID": "7102030700", "AffiliationID": "60023882, 60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus University"}}}
