For this we provide a number of classification rules which allow for the extraction of specific arguments from the drug reviews. For each review we use the extracted arguments to instantiate a Dung argument graph. We undertake an evaluation of the resulting argument graphs by applying Dung\u2019s grounded semantics. We demonstrate a correlation between the arguments in the grounded extension of the graph and the rating provided by the user for that particular drug.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classification rules", "Patient experiences", "Social webs"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026313472", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57195219644": {"Name": "Noor K.", "AuthorID": "57195219644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7201374779": {"Name": "Mayer A.", "AuthorID": "7201374779", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
