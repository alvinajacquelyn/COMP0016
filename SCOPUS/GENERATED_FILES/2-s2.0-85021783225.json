Whilst pathways driving inflammatory responses in macrophages have been relatively well described, negative regulatory pathways are less well defined. We hypothesised that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specifically targets negative regulatory pathways to augment immunopathology. Inhibition of signalling through the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway increased matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) gene expression and secretion, a collagenase central to TB pathogenesis, and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. In patients with confirmed pulmonary TB, PI3K\u03b4 expression was absent within granulomas. Furthermore, Mtb infection suppressed PI3K\u03b4 gene expression in macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition of the MNK pathway, downstream of pro-inflammatory p38 and ERK MAPKs, also increased MMP-1 secretion, whilst suppressing secretion of TH1cytokines. Cross-talk between the PI3K and MNK pathways was demonstrated at the level of eIF4E phosphorylation. Mtb globally suppressed the MMP-inhibitory pathways in macrophages, reducing levels of mRNAs encoding PI3K\u03b4, mTORC-1 and MNK-1 via upregulation of miRNAs. Therefore, Mtb disrupts negative regulatory pathways at multiple levels in macrophages to drive a tissue-destructive phenotype that facilitates transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Macrophages", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 1", "Mice", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021783225", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57193081972": {"Name": "Brace P.T.", "AuthorID": "57193081972", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "37028972600": {"Name": "Tezera L.B.", "AuthorID": "37028972600", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "35558142200": {"Name": "Bielecka M.K.", "AuthorID": "35558142200", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "55897461700": {"Name": "Mellows T.", "AuthorID": "55897461700", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57194728310": {"Name": "Garay D.", "AuthorID": "57194728310", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6602450452": {"Name": "Jogai S.", "AuthorID": "6602450452", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "36897500700": {"Name": "Millar T.M.", "AuthorID": "36897500700", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6602837335": {"Name": "Sanchez-Elsner T.", "AuthorID": "6602837335", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57194531731": {"Name": "Elkington P.T.", "AuthorID": "57194531731", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "56177510600": {"Name": "Tian S.", "AuthorID": "56177510600", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60108899", "AffiliationName": "South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "7006929886": {"Name": "Proud C.G.", "AuthorID": "7006929886", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60108899", "AffiliationName": "South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "7004527396": {"Name": "Rand L.", "AuthorID": "7004527396", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Imperial College London"}, "57199008047": {"Name": "Green J.", "AuthorID": "57199008047", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Imperial College London"}, "7102333663": {"Name": "Friedland J.S.", "AuthorID": "7102333663", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Imperial College London"}, "7102182480": {"Name": "Steele A.J.", "AuthorID": "7102182480", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}}}
