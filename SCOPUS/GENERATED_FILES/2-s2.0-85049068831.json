Methods: We evaluated the online results service using a mixed-methods approach within large exploratory studies of the eSHC. Participants were chlamydia- positive and negative users of online postal self-sampling services in six National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) areas and chlamydia-positive patients from two genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics between 21 July 2014 and 13 March 2015. Participants received a discreetly worded National Health Service 'NHS no-reply' text message (SMS) informing them that their test results were ready and providing a weblink to a secure website. Participants logged in with their date of birth and mobile telephone or clinic number. Chlamydia-positive patients were offered online management. All interactions with the eSHC system were automatically logged and their timing recorded. Post-treatment, a service evaluation survey (n=152) and qualitative interviews (n=36) were conducted by telephone. Chlamydia-negative patients were offered a short online survey (n=274). Data were integrated. Results: 92% (134/146) of NCSP chlamydia-positive patients, 82% (161/197) of GUM chlamydia-positive patients and 89% (1776/1997) of NCSP chlamydia-negative participants accessed test results within 7 days. 91% of chlamydia-positive patients were happy with the results service; 64% of those who had tested previously found the results service better or much better than previous experiences. 90% of chlamydia-negative survey participants agreed they would be happy to receive results this way in the future. Interviewees described accessing results with ease and appreciated the privacy and control the two-step process gave them. Conclusion: A discreet SMS to alert users/patients that results are available, followed by provision of results via a secure website, was highly acceptable, irrespective of test result and testing history. The eSHC results service afforded users privacy and control over when they viewed results without compromising access.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chlamydia infection", "clinical sti care", "service delivery", "testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Chlamydia Infections", "Diagnostic Tests, Routine", "Disease Notification", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Privacy", "Sexual Health", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Telephone", "Text Messaging", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049068831", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56443440100": {"Name": "Gibbs J.", "AuthorID": "56443440100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36145001800": {"Name": "Aicken C.R.H.", "AuthorID": "36145001800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Research in Sexual Health and HIV, Institute of Global Health, University College London"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Research in Sexual Health and HIV, Institute of Global Health, University College London"}, "18438660400": {"Name": "Sutcliffe L.J.", "AuthorID": "18438660400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57006558800": {"Name": "Tickle L.J.", "AuthorID": "57006558800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57205874518": {"Name": "Estcourt C.S.", "AuthorID": "57205874518", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Life Science, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "35145608800": {"Name": "Gkatzidou V.", "AuthorID": "35145608800", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "6602568656": {"Name": "Hone K.", "AuthorID": "6602568656", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "7006420323": {"Name": "Sadiq S.T.", "AuthorID": "7006420323", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Applied Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Unit, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's University of London"}}}
