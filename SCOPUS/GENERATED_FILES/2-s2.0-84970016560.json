By using an optical frequency comb generator (OFCG), 5 optical tones spaced by 15 GHz are selected and split into odd and even optical subcarriers modulated separately using 10 Gbaud quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) with Nyquist bandwidth achieved by using root raised cosine (RRC) filter with 0.01 roll off factor. These optical subcarriers are combined and transmitted over 10 km fibre to the remote antenna unit (Rau). The optical bands are then filtered and transmitted separately at the Rau in a wireless channel. The received sub-THz band is down-converted to the IF frequency and digital signal processing is employed at the receiver to measure the BER. The performance is also evaluated to investigate the impact of the uplink on the downlink optical transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital coherent detection", "fibre wireless", "high-speed wireless", "optical heterodyning", "Photonic THz generation", "radio-over-fibre"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital coherent detections", "High speed wireless", "Optical frequency comb generators", "Optical heterodyning", "Quadrature phaseshift keying (QPSK)", "Root raised cosine filter", "THz generation", "Wireless transmissions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970016560", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16231956400": {"Name": "Van Dijk F.", "AuthorID": "16231956400", "AffiliationID": "60107882, 60007823, 60026638", "AffiliationName": "III-V Lab, A Joint Laboratory of Alcatel Lucent Bell Labs, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-LETI"}}}
