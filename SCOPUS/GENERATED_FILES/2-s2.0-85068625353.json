However, it is not only physically salient stimuli that grab our attention: Recent research has shown that reward history also influences the likelihood that stimuli will capture attention. Here, we investigated whether resource-dependent control processes modulate the effect of reward on attentional capture, much as for the effect of physical salience. To this end, we used eye tracking with a rewarded visual search task and compared performance under conditions of high and low working memory load. In two experiments, we demonstrated that oculomotor capture by high-reward distractor stimuli is enhanced under high memory load. These results highlight the role of executive-control processes in modulating distraction by reward-related stimuli. Our findings have implications for understanding the neurocognitive processes involved in real-life conditions in which reward-related stimuli may influence behavior, such as addiction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attention", "cognitive processes", "motivation", "open data", "open materials", "rewards"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Behavior, Addictive", "Cognition", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Motivation", "Photic Stimulation", "Reward", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068625353", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55340167900": {"Name": "Watson P.", "AuthorID": "55340167900", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "56402562600": {"Name": "Pearson D.", "AuthorID": "56402562600", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "57209745231": {"Name": "Chow M.", "AuthorID": "57209745231", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "6601986889": {"Name": "Most S.B.", "AuthorID": "6601986889", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "6603589906": {"Name": "Le Pelley M.E.", "AuthorID": "6603589906", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "57215443049": {"Name": "Theeuwes J.", "AuthorID": "57215443049", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "6701516741": {"Name": "Wiers R.W.", "AuthorID": "6701516741", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "ADAPT Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}}}
