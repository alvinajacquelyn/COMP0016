Perhaps as a result, little research has focused on younger kids\u2019 risk recognition and coping. Such knowledge is, however, critical for designing efficient safeguarding mechanisms for this age group. Through 12 focus group studies with 29 children aged 6-10 from UK schools, we examined how children described privacy risks related to their use of tablet computers and what information was used by them to identify threats. We found that children could identify and articulate certain privacy risks well, such as information oversharing or revealing real identities online; however, they had less awareness with respect to other risks, such as online tracking or game promotions. Our findings offer promising directions for supporting children\u2019s awareness of cyber risks and the ability to protect themselves online.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Family technologies", "Privacy", "Scaffolding", "Tablet computers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Children", "Family technologies", "Focus group studies", "On-line tracking", "Online privacy", "Risk recognition", "Scaffolding", "Tablet computer"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067631904", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57194281130": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57194281130", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}, "6507917811": {"Name": "Van Kleek M.", "AuthorID": "6507917811", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}, "56867428600": {"Name": "Shadbolt N.", "AuthorID": "56867428600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}, "57209399294": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "57209399294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "57209399723": {"Name": "Dally C.", "AuthorID": "57209399723", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "24777208600": {"Name": "Slovak P.", "AuthorID": "24777208600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}}}
