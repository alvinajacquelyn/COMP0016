We have assessed how differences in absorption and half-life of cortisol influence glucocorticoid exposure. Patients and Methods Forty-eight patients (21 M) aged between 6\u00b71 and 20\u00b73 years with CAH due to CYP21A2 deficiency were studied. Each patient underwent a 24-h plasma cortisol profile with the morning dose used to calculate absorption parameters along with an intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone (15 mg/m2 body surface area) bolus assessment of half-life. Parameters derived were maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax), time to attaining plasma cortisol concentration <100 nmol/l and half-life of cortisol. Results Mean half-life was 76\u00b75 \u00b1 5\u00b72 (range 40-225\u00b73) min, Cmax 780\u00b77 \u00b1 61\u00b76 nmol/l and tmax 66\u00b77 (range 20-118) min. Time taken to a plasma cortisol concentration less than 100 nmol/l was 289 (range 140-540) min. Those with a fast half-life and slow tmax took longest to reach a plasma cortisol concentration less than 100 nmol/l (380 \u00b1 34\u00b76 min), compared to those with a slow half-life and fast tmax (298 \u00b1 34\u00b78 min) and those with a fast half-life and fast tmax (249\u00b75 \u00b1 14\u00b74 min) (One-way anovaF = 4\u00b752; P = 0\u00b7009). Conclusions Both rate of absorption and half-life of cortisol in the circulation play important roles in determining overall exposure to oral glucocorticoid. Dose regimens need to incorporate estimates of these parameters into determining the optimum dosing schedule for individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Adolescent", "Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital", "Child", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Half-Life", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Male", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924187508", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57203616076": {"Name": "Hindmarsh P.", "AuthorID": "57203616076", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004635158": {"Name": "Charmandari E.", "AuthorID": "7004635158", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}}}
