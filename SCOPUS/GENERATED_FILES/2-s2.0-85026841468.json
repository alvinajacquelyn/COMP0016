The twin discoveries of the quantum Hall effect1, in the 1980s, and of topological band insulators2, in the 2000s, were landmarks in physics that enriched our view of the electronic properties of solids. In a nutshell, these discoveries have taught us that quantum mechanical wavefunctions in crystalline solids may carry nontrivial topological invariants which have ramifications for the observable physics. One of the side effects of the recent topological insulator revolution has been that such physics is much more widespread than was appreciated ten years ago. For example, while topological insulators were originally studied in the context of electron wavefunctions, recent work has initiated a hunt for topological insulators in bosonic systems: in photonic crystals3-6, in the vibrational modes of crystals7, and in the excitations of ordered magnets8. Using inelastic neutron scattering along with theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that, in a weak magnetic field, the dimerized quantum magnet SrCu 2 (BO 3 ) 2 is a bosonic topological insulator with topologically protected chiral edge modes of triplon excitations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystalline solids", "Electron wavefunctions", "Quantum mechanical", "Theoretical calculations", "Topological bands", "Topological invariants", "Vibrational modes", "Weak magnetic fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026841468", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"16679352800": {"Name": "McClarty P.A.", "AuthorID": "16679352800", "AffiliationID": "60032834", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems"}, "7101647552": {"Name": "Kruger F.", "AuthorID": "7101647552", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "6603258864": {"Name": "Guidi T.", "AuthorID": "6603258864", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7401647290": {"Name": "Parker S.F.", "AuthorID": "7401647290", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6701308379": {"Name": "Refson K.", "AuthorID": "6701308379", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7403267977": {"Name": "Parker A.W.", "AuthorID": "7403267977", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7004283781": {"Name": "Prabhakaran D.", "AuthorID": "7004283781", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "57197085987": {"Name": "Coldea R.", "AuthorID": "57197085987", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
