The presented model is based on differential equations where their dynamics reflects many aspects of thyroid's behavior. Our main focus here is the well known, but not well understood, phenomenon so called as Wolff-Chaikoff effect. It is shown that the inhibitory effect of intake iodide on the rate of one single enzyme causes a similar effect as Wolff-Chaikoff. Besides this issue, the presented model is capable of revealing other complex phenomena of thyroid hormones homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differential equation", "Relaxation oscillation", "System biology", "Thyroid", "Wolff-Chaikoff effect"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamical model", "Inhibitory effect", "Relaxation oscillation", "System biology", "Thyroid", "Thyroid hormones", "Wolff-Chaikoff effect"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916624483", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"35491555800": {"Name": "Rokni Lamooki G.", "AuthorID": "35491555800", "AffiliationID": "60017853, 60001610", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)"}, "35957391900": {"Name": "Shirazi A.", "AuthorID": "35957391900", "AffiliationID": "60017853, 60001610", "AffiliationName": "Computational Physical Sciences Research Laboratory, School of Nano Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)"}, "7101619634": {"Name": "Mani A.", "AuthorID": "7101619634", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
