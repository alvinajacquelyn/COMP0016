Previous work has established that trafficking kinesin proteins (TRAKs),TRAK1 and TRAK2, are kinesin adaptor proteins that link mitochondria to kinesin motor proteins via an acceptor protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane, etc. the Rho GTPase Miro. Recent studies have shown that TRAK1 preferentially controls mitochondrial transport in axons of hippocampal neurons by virtue of its binding to both kinesin and dynein motor proteins, whereas TRAK2 controls mitochondrial transport in dendrites resulting from its binding to dynein. This study further investigates the subcellular localization of TRAK1 and TRAK2 in primary cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons by using both commercial antibodies and anti-TRAK1 and anti-TRAK2 antibodies raised in our own laboratory (in-house). Whereas TRAK1 was prevalently localized in axons of hippocampal and cortical neurons, TRAK2 was more prevalent in dendrites of hippocampal neurons. In cortical neurons, TRAK2 was equally distributed between axons and dendrites. Some qualitative differences were observed between commercial and in-house-generated antibody immunostaining.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Kinesin adaptor proteins", "Miro", "Mitochondrial transport", "Trafficking kinesin binding protein", "TRAK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "Animals", "Axons", "Carrier Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Cerebral Cortex", "Dendrites", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "Rats", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929656446", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"22135441600": {"Name": "Loss O.", "AuthorID": "22135441600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7101637279": {"Name": "Stephenson F.A.", "AuthorID": "7101637279", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
