Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Background: Overexpression of microRNA-31 (miR-31) is implicated in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a deadly disease associated with dietary zinc deficiency. Using a rat model that recapitulates features of human ESCC, the mechanism whereby Zn regulates miR-31 expression to promote ESCC is examined. Methods: To inhibit in vivo esophageal miR-31 overexpression in Zn-deficient rats (n = 12-20 per group), locked nucleic acid-modified anti-miR-31 oligonucleotides were administered over five weeks. miR-31 expression was determined by northern blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization. Physiological miR-31 targets were identified by microarray analysis and verified by luciferase reporter assay. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of inflammation genes were determined by immunoblotting, caspase assays, and immunohistochemistry. The miR-31 promoter in Zn-deficient esophagus was identified by ChIP-seq using an antibody for histone mark H3K4me3. Data were analyzed with t test and analysis of variance. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: In vivo, anti-miR-31 reduced miR-31 overexpression (P = .002) and suppressed the esophageal preneoplasia in Zndeficient rats. At the same time, the miR-31 target Stk40 was derepressed, thereby inhibiting the STK40-NF-controlled inflammatory pathway, with resultant decreased cellular proliferation and activated apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activities, fold change = 10.7, P = .005). This same connection between miR-31 overexpression and STK40/NF- expression was also documented in human ESCC cell lines. In Zn-deficient esophagus, the miR-31 promoter region and NF- binding site were activated. Zn replenishment restored the regulation of this genomic region and a normal esophageal phenotype. Conclusions: The data define the in vivo signaling pathway underlying interaction of Zn deficiency and miR-31 overexpression in esophageal neoplasia and provide a mechanistic rationale for miR-31 as a therapeutic target for ESCC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Blotting, Northern", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cell Proliferation", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Immunohistochemistry", "Inflammation", "Male", "Microarray Analysis", "MicroRNAs", "NF-kappa B", "Oligonucleotides", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction", "Up-Regulation", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962003254", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"16302702000": {"Name": "Taccioli C.", "AuthorID": "16302702000", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "23992468000": {"Name": "Garofalo M.", "AuthorID": "23992468000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Transcriptional Networks in Lung Cancer Group, Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "9039755800": {"Name": "Di Leva G.", "AuthorID": "9039755800", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "7004829900": {"Name": "Alder H.", "AuthorID": "7004829900", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "40261254700": {"Name": "Fadda P.", "AuthorID": "40261254700", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "55771297500": {"Name": "Middleton J.", "AuthorID": "55771297500", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "7202975031": {"Name": "Croce C.M.", "AuthorID": "7202975031", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "57202057387": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "57202057387", "AffiliationID": "112593689", "AffiliationName": "Kimmel Cancer Center"}, "8976022600": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "8976022600", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy, and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "15025456200": {"Name": "Smalley K.J.", "AuthorID": "15025456200", "AffiliationID": "112593689", "AffiliationName": "Kimmel Cancer Center"}, "7005621612": {"Name": "Fong L.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005621612", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy, and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "7201468271": {"Name": "Farber J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201468271", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy, and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "55796160800": {"Name": "Tagliazucchi G.M.", "AuthorID": "55796160800", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "56046040800": {"Name": "Selmi T.", "AuthorID": "56046040800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences"}, "57196685919": {"Name": "Naidu S.", "AuthorID": "57196685919", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Transcriptional Networks in Lung Cancer Group, Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}}}
