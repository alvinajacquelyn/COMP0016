The impact of the lifetime profile of resources on homeownership is larger when credit market imperfections are more severe. We combine data from the Bank of Italy's Survey on Household Income and Wealth with information on regional differences in interest rate spreads. We find that an increase in current resources by 10,000 euros increases the probability of homeownership by five (two) percentage points under the least (most) favourable credit market conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["credit market conditions", "D1", "D91", "housing tenure", "interest rate spread", "R21"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947975777", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56974243500": {"Name": "Trucchi S.", "AuthorID": "56974243500", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "University of Bologna"}}}
