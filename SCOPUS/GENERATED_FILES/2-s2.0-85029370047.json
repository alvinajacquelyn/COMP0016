Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Thermostats are widely used in temperature regulation of indoor spaces and have a direct impact on energy use and occupant thermal comfort. Existing guidelines make recommendations for properly selecting set points to reduce energy use, but there is little or no information regarding the actual achieved thermal comfort of the occupants. While dry-bulb air temperature measured at the thermostat location is sometimes a good proxy, there is less understanding of whether thermal comfort targets are actually met. In this direction, we have defined an experimental simulation protocol involving two office buildings; the buildings have contrasting geometrical and construction characteristics, as well as different building services systems for meeting heating and cooling demands. A parametric analysis is performed for combinations of controlled variables and boundary conditions. In all cases, occupant thermal comfort is estimated using the Fanger index, as defined in ISO 7730. The results of the parametric study suggest that simple bounds on the dry-bulb air temperature are not sufficient to ensure comfort, and in many cases, more detailed considerations taking into account building characteristics, as well as the types of building heating and cooling services are required. The implication is that the calculation or estimation of detailed comfort indices, or even the use of personalised comfort models, is key towards a more human-centric approach to building design and operation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building energy performance simulation", "Fanger", "Human-centred design and operation", "Thermal comfort", "Thermostats"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building characteristics", "Building energy performance", "Building services systems", "Experimental simulations", "Fanger", "Human centred design", "Indoor climate control", "Temperature regulations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029370047", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24490921000": {"Name": "Kontes G.D.", "AuthorID": "24490921000", "AffiliationID": "60015671", "AffiliationName": "Technical Building Systems Group, Nuremberg Branch, Department of Energy Efficiency and Indoor Climate, Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics"}, "55565119400": {"Name": "Steiger S.", "AuthorID": "55565119400", "AffiliationID": "60015671", "AffiliationName": "Technical Building Systems Group, Nuremberg Branch, Department of Energy Efficiency and Indoor Climate, Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics"}, "36655628100": {"Name": "Giannakis G.I.", "AuthorID": "36655628100", "AffiliationID": "60022461", "AffiliationName": "School of Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete"}, "57192371525": {"Name": "Horn P.", "AuthorID": "57192371525", "AffiliationID": "60103936", "AffiliationName": "Energy Department, Austrian Institute of Technology"}, "6507344235": {"Name": "Rovas D.V.", "AuthorID": "6507344235", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}}}
