This is particularly true in the area of point cloud processing. It is therefore naturally lucrative to explore established big data frameworks for big geospatial data. The very first hurdle is the import of geospatial data into big data frameworks, commonly referred to as data ingestion. Geospatial data is typically encoded in specialised binary file formats, which are not naturally supported by the existing big data frameworks. Instead such file formats are supported by software libraries that are restricted to single CPU execution. We present an approach that allows the use of existing point cloud file format libraries on the Apache Spark big data framework. We demonstrate the ingestion of large volumes of point cloud data into a compute cluster. The approach uses a map function to distribute the data ingestion across the nodes of a cluster. We test the capabilities of the proposed method to load billions of points into a commodity hardware compute cluster and we discuss the implications on scalability and performance. The performance is benchmarked against an existing native Apache Spark data import implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big Data", "Cloud Computing", "LiDAR", "Point Cloud", "Spark"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binary file formats", "Commodity hardware", "Data ingestions", "Geo-spatial data", "Point cloud", "Point cloud data", "Scalability and performance", "Software libraries"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981276975", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"57147072600": {"Name": "Boehm J.", "AuthorID": "57147072600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "56539060900": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "56539060900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "26532256800": {"Name": "Alis C.", "AuthorID": "26532256800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
