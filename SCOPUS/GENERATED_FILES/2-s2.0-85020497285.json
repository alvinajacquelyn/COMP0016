The nuclear-spin-dependent partition functions are obtained by the direct summation technique, involving altogether about 16 000 measured and more than nine million computed bound rovibrational energy levels for the three molecules. Reliable standard uncertainties, as a function of temperature, are estimated for each thermochemical quantity determined, including the enthalpy, the entropy, and the isobaric heat capacity of the individual nuclear-spin-equilibrated isotopologues and of heavy water. The accuracy of the heavy-water ideal-gas Cp(T) is unprecedented, below 0.01% up to 1800 K. All.the thermochemical functions are reported, in 1 K increments, in the supplementary material. 2017 AIP Publishing LLC for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Internal partition functions", "Isobaric heat capacity", "National Institute of Standards and Technology", "Ro-vibrational energies", "Standard mean ocean waters", "Standard uncertainty", "Temperature dependent", "Thermochemical functions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020497285", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57205773189": {"Name": "Simk\u00f3 I.", "AuthorID": "57205773189", "AffiliationID": "60025187", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Structure and Dynamics, Institute of Chemistry, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor \u00e1nd University"}, "56136119500": {"Name": "D\u00e9nes N.", "AuthorID": "56136119500", "AffiliationID": "60025187", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Structure and Dynamics, Institute of Chemistry, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor \u00e1nd University"}, "10541128500": {"Name": "Furtenbacher T.", "AuthorID": "10541128500", "AffiliationID": "60100914", "AffiliationName": "MTA-ELTE Complex Chemical Systems Research Group"}, "7006318099": {"Name": "Hruby J.", "AuthorID": "7006318099", "AffiliationID": "60068905, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Thermomechanics of the CAS, v.v.i."}, "35583085500": {"Name": "Zobov N.F.", "AuthorID": "35583085500", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Science"}, "7006554518": {"Name": "Polyansky O.L.", "AuthorID": "7006554518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004231296": {"Name": "Gamache R.R.", "AuthorID": "7004231296", "AffiliationID": "60033461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental, Earth, and Atmospheric Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell"}, "31067548100": {"Name": "Szidarovszky T.", "AuthorID": "31067548100", "AffiliationID": "60100914", "AffiliationName": "MTA-ELTE Complex Chemical Systems Research Group"}, "7006170430": {"Name": "C\u015basz\u00e1r A.G.", "AuthorID": "7006170430", "AffiliationID": "60100914", "AffiliationName": "MTA-ELTE Complex Chemical Systems Research Group"}}}
