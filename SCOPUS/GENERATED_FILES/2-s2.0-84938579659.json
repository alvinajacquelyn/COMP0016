These differences have created complicated linkages between regions in China. In this study, building upon gravity model and location quotient techniques, we develop a sector-specific model to estimate inter-provincial trade flows, which is the base for making a multi-regional input-output table. In the model, we distinguish sectors with less intra-sector input from those with larger intra-sector input, and assume that the former sectors tend to compete among regions while the latter tend to cooperate among regions. Then we apply this new method of inter-regional trade estimation to three sectors: food and tobacco, metal smelting and processing, and electrical equipment. The results show that selection of bandwidth has a significant impact on the assessment of inter-regional trade. Trade flows are more scattered with the increase of bandwidths. As a result, bandwidth reflects the spatial concentration of geographical activities, which should be distinguishable for different industries. We conclude that the sector-specific spatial model can increase the credibility of estimates of inter-regional trade flows.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "multi-regional input-output analysis", "sector-specific statistical model", "trade flows"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938579659", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"56244286200": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56244286200", "AffiliationID": "60031150, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS"}, "36700424300": {"Name": "Tang Z.", "AuthorID": "36700424300", "AffiliationID": "60031150, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS"}, "57214904208": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57214904208", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Sustainability Research Institute, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60101489, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "ST Edmund\u2019s College, University of Cambridge"}, "35292968200": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "35292968200", "AffiliationID": "60024045", "AffiliationName": "College of Public Administration, Nanjing Agricultural University"}}}
