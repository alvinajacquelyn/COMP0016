One way to address interorganelle communication is to study the interactions of the proteins involved, particularly targeting interactions, which are a key way to regulate activity. While most peripheral membrane proteins have single determinants for membrane targeting, proteins involved in interorganelle communication have more than one such determinant, sometimes as many as four, as in Vps13. Here we review the targeting determinants, showing how they can be relatively hard to find, how they are regulated, and how proteins integrate information from multiple targeting determinants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Animals", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Organelles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061917321", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57192424060": {"Name": "Alli-Balogun G.", "AuthorID": "57192424060", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7102551297": {"Name": "Levine T.", "AuthorID": "7102551297", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
