With one of the central principles being the application of multimodal pain interventions to reduce the reliance on opioid-based medications, enhanced recovery pathways provide a framework that decreases perioperative opioid use. The fourth Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts representing anesthesiology, surgery, and nursing with the objective of providing consensus recommendations on this important topic. Fourth Perioperative Quality Initiative was a consensus-building conference designed around a modified Delphi process in which the group alternately convened for plenary discussion sessions in between small group discussions. The process included several iterative steps including a literature review of the topics, building consensus around the important questions related to the topic, and sequential steps of content building and refinement until agreement was achieved and a consensus document was produced. During the fourth Perioperative Quality Initiative conference and thereafter as a writing group, reference applicability to the topic was discussed in any area where there was disagreement. For this manuscript, the questions answered included (1) What are the potential strategies for preventing persistent postoperative opioid use? (2) Is opioid-free anesthesia and analgesia feasible and appropriate for routine operations? and (3) Is opioid-free (intraoperative) anesthesia associated with equivalent or superior outcomes compared to an opioid minimization in the perioperative period? We will discuss the relevant literature for each questions, emphasize what we do not know, and prioritize the areas for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Consensus", "Delphi Technique", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Humans", "Incidence", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Pain Management", "Pain, Postoperative", "Postoperative Care", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Terminology as Topic", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070024705", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"8044800400": {"Name": "Wu C.L.", "AuthorID": "8044800400", "AffiliationID": "60006433", "AffiliationName": "Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality, Johns Hopkins Medicine"}, "56865221400": {"Name": "King A.B.", "AuthorID": "56865221400", "AffiliationID": "60006475, 60003915", "AffiliationName": null}, "15738895900": {"Name": "McEvoy M.D.", "AuthorID": "15738895900", "AffiliationID": "60006475, 60003915", "AffiliationName": null}, "12794225300": {"Name": "Geiger T.M.", "AuthorID": "12794225300", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": null}, "23034232400": {"Name": "Grant M.C.", "AuthorID": "23034232400", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60175924, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Perioperative Medicine and Critical Care, Southampton National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust/University of Southampton"}, "55488120400": {"Name": "Gupta R.", "AuthorID": "55488120400", "AffiliationID": "60101642", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Stony Brook School of Medicine"}, "56823105800": {"Name": "Gan T.J.", "AuthorID": "56823105800", "AffiliationID": "60101642", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Stony Brook School of Medicine"}, "35175969400": {"Name": "Hah J.M.", "AuthorID": "35175969400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford University"}, "36843561700": {"Name": "Miller T.E.", "AuthorID": "36843561700", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center"}, "35515911700": {"Name": "Shaw A.D.", "AuthorID": "35515911700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Alberta"}, "57027288300": {"Name": "Thacker J.K.M.", "AuthorID": "57027288300", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "35458587700": {"Name": "Mythen M.G.", "AuthorID": "35458587700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
