The penalty associated with signal linewidth, as well as the optical linewidth requirements for systems using free-running lasers are evaluated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations for different modulation formats. The BER performance and power penalty induced by signal linewidth are also measured experimentally by varying the linewidth of the local oscillator laser. Simulation and experimental results show similar penalty trends. Differences between them are likely to be due to impairments not considered in the simulations and the THz signal linewidth being bigger than the sum of the optical linewidths of the two free-running lasers used in the experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital coherent detection", "fibre wireless", "high-speed wireless", "optical heterodyning", "Photonic THz generation", "radioover-fibre"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital coherent detections", "Free-running lasers", "High speed wireless", "Local oscillators", "Modulation formats", "Optical linewidth", "Phase estimation algorithms", "THz generation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011309623", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"57191924710": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Guerrero L.", "AuthorID": "57191924710", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16231956400": {"Name": "Van Dijk F.", "AuthorID": "16231956400", "AffiliationID": "60107882, 60007823, 60026638", "AffiliationName": "III-V Lab, A Joint Laboratory of 'Alcatel Lucent Bell Labs', 'Thales Research and Technology' and 'Cea-LETI'"}}}
