When undetected in septorhinoplasty patients, it will often lead to poor outcomes. Design: We performed a prospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of BDD in our patients and whether surgical correction could be considered. Setting and participants: We recruited 34 patients being considered for septorhinoplasty in a tertiary referral rhinology clinic and a control group of 50 from the otology clinic giving a total of 84. Main outcome measures: Participants completed the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ), the sino-nasal outcome test-23 (SNOT-23) and underwent nasal inspiratory peak flow (NIPF). Those found to be at high risk for BDD were referred to a clinical psychologist. Results: Of the septorhinoplasty patients, 11 (32%) were high risk for BDD. Following psychological assessment, 7 (63%) patients were felt to be unsuitable for surgery and were offered psychological therapy. SNOT-23 scores were significantly higher in the BDD group indicating a negative impact on quality of life. NIPF readings were not significantly different in the BDD group compared to the control group. Conclusions: The BDDQ is a valid tool for identifying patients at risk of BDD. A close working relationship with clinical psychology has been advantageous to help the selection process of candidates for surgery when there is a high risk of BDD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Nose Deformities, Acquired", "Preoperative Period", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Rhinoplasty", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994805480", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"35788872600": {"Name": "Joseph J.", "AuthorID": "35788872600", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "35373930800": {"Name": "Randhawa P.", "AuthorID": "35373930800", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "14051799300": {"Name": "Hannan S.A.", "AuthorID": "14051799300", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "57191920164": {"Name": "Long J.", "AuthorID": "57191920164", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "57130024500": {"Name": "Goh S.", "AuthorID": "57130024500", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "57191918167": {"Name": "O'Shea N.", "AuthorID": "57191918167", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "14521750300": {"Name": "Andrews P.", "AuthorID": "14521750300", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Ear Institute, UCL"}, "35596611200": {"Name": "Saleh H.", "AuthorID": "35596611200", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastics Surgery, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "24390768600": {"Name": "Hansen E.", "AuthorID": "24390768600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102803269": {"Name": "Veale D.", "AuthorID": "7102803269", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London and the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
