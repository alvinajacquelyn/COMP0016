We investigate an algebraization of Schaefer's framework in which the Fourier transform is used to represent constraints by multilinear polynomials in a unique way. This representation of constraints gives rise to a relaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables are linear operators on some Hilbert space. For constraints given by a system of linear equations over the two-element field, earlier work in the foundations of quantum mechanics has shown that there are systems that have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operator assignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Our main result is a complete characterization of the classes of Boolean relations for which there is a gap between satisfiability in the Boolean domain and the relaxation of satisfiability via operator assignments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constraint satisfaction problem", "Dichotomy theorems", "Linear operators", "Non-local games", "pp-Definitions", "Quantum satisfiability", "Undecidable problems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dichotomy theorem", "Linear operators", "Nonlocal", "Satisfiability", "Undecidable problems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066126138", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55885344800": {"Name": "Atserias A.", "AuthorID": "55885344800", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya"}, "7004313812": {"Name": "Kolaitis P.G.", "AuthorID": "7004313812", "AffiliationID": "60021293", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research\u2013Almaden"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}}}
