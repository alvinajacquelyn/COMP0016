There is nothing to suggest that Government will address this in the near future for all parts of the UK. In which case, policy makers and campaigners might instead seek out consistent and robust measures of the population-level factors which are known to contribute to food insecurity. However, no systematic measures exist, meaning that resources may not be targeted at those areas most in need. This paper presents the first objective estimate of high population-level risk of household food insecurity in English neighbourhoods (4.09% of the population, 95%CI 4.08\u20134.10) using public data. Estimated geographic distribution of factors contributing to household food insecurity is customisable to local pressures and is adaptable to settings outside of England.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Food insecurity", "GIS", "Population estimation", "Secondary data analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040035841", "SubjectAreas": [["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"24491207000": {"Name": "Smith D.", "AuthorID": "24491207000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography & Environment, University of Southampton"}, "55557373700": {"Name": "Thompson C.", "AuthorID": "55557373700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "26639213900": {"Name": "Harland K.", "AuthorID": "26639213900", "AffiliationID": "120029004", "AffiliationName": "Actionable Intelligence"}, "57200175222": {"Name": "Parker S.", "AuthorID": "57200175222", "AffiliationID": "120029187", "AffiliationName": "Surry Hospital Trust"}, "6601962405": {"Name": "Shelton N.", "AuthorID": "6601962405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}}}
