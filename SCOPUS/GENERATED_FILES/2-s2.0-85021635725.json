Here, PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) microbubbles (diameter rang\u1ebd126 to 414 \u03bcm) were used to fabricate beaded (beads-on) nanofibers using an electrohydrodynamicatomization (EHDA) technique. Mean fiber diameter, inter-bead distance, and aspect ratio (AR)were investigated by regulating EHDA process parameters. PVA fibers (diameter range ~233 to737 nm) were obtained possessing bead ARs in the range of ~10 to 56%. AR was used to modulatehydrophilicity and active release.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beaded nanofibers", "Bubble", "Electrospinning", "Polyvinyl alcohol"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bubble", "Fiber diameters", "Microbubbles", "Microstructure engineering", "Morphing", "Process parameters", "PVA fiber"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021635725", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"57190392802": {"Name": "Yao Z.", "AuthorID": "57190392802", "AffiliationID": "60117854, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology, Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Zhejiang University"}, "57194683717": {"Name": "Yuan Q.", "AuthorID": "57194683717", "AffiliationID": "106457155", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering of Education, Ministry of China"}, "35766898100": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "35766898100", "AffiliationID": "106457155", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering of Education, Ministry of China"}, "35387659500": {"Name": "Chang M.", "AuthorID": "35387659500", "AffiliationID": "60117854, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology, Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Zhejiang University"}, "55418069300": {"Name": "Ahmad Z.", "AuthorID": "55418069300", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "Leicester School of Pharmacy, De Montfort University"}, "35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
