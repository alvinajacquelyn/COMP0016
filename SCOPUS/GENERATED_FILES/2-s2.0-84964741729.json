Methods: Adults >55 years of age (N = 1296; N = 515 employed; N = 781 unemployed) self-reported measures of demographic and health-related variables, and a measure of sitting time (ie, SIT-Q). Results: Employed total sitting time (min/day) was positively associated with home Internet access (B = 71.2, 95% CI, 8.9 to 133.4, p =.025), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2; B = 7.0, 95% CI, 2.1-11.9, p =.005), and negatively associated with physical health (B = -2.3; 95% CI, -4.9 to 0.3, p =.013). Unemployed total sitting time was negatively associated with age (B per year = -3.0, 95% CI, -4.9 to -1.1, p =.002), and being male (B = -54.0, 95% CI, -86.7 to -21.3, p =.001). Unemployed total sitting time was positively associated with Internet access (B = 54.1, 95% CI, 17.7 to 90.4, p =.004) and BMI (B = 4.1, 95% CI,.94 to 7.3, p =.011). Conclusions: Older adults reported low levels of sitting time. Different correlates emerged for the employed and unemployed samples across sitting domains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Employment status", "Older adults", "Sedentariness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Body Mass Index", "Employment", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Posture", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964741729", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"9632420300": {"Name": "Vallance J.", "AuthorID": "9632420300", "AffiliationID": "60018510", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Disciplines, Athabasca University"}, "8400214000": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "8400214000", "AffiliationID": "60018510", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Disciplines, Athabasca University"}, "6508341980": {"Name": "Eurich D.", "AuthorID": "6508341980", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Alberta"}, "11940427900": {"Name": "Lynch B.", "AuthorID": "11940427900", "AffiliationID": "60001052", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Centre, Cancer Council Victoria"}, "24398815900": {"Name": "Gardiner P.", "AuthorID": "24398815900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Queensland"}, "13009043300": {"Name": "Taylor L.", "AuthorID": "13009043300", "AffiliationID": "60105825", "AffiliationName": "Research Lead, Nutrition Services, Alberta Health Services"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}}}
