In particular, we examine how lifeways here (may have) differed from surrounding areas and what circumstances drew human and animal populations to the region. Integrating multiple material cultural and environmental datasets, we explore some of the strategies of these eastern Jordanian groups that resulted in changes in settlement, subsistence and interaction and, in some areas, the occupation of substantial aggregation sites. Five years of excavation at the aggregation site of Kharaneh IV suggest some very intriguing technological and social on-site activities, as well as adaptations to a dynamic landscape unlike that of today. Here we discuss particular aspects of the Kharaneh IV material record within the context of ongoing palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and place these findings in the wider spatial and temporal narratives of the Azraq Basin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation", "Azraq", "Epipalaeolithic", "Hunter-gatherers", "Jordan", "Kharaneh IV"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960222289", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"7102490362": {"Name": "Maher L.", "AuthorID": "7102490362", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley"}, "57197742384": {"Name": "Macdonald D.", "AuthorID": "57197742384", "AffiliationID": "60015573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Tulsa"}, "44661263700": {"Name": "Allentuck A.", "AuthorID": "44661263700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55470564900": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "55470564900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57194938393": {"Name": "Spyrou A.", "AuthorID": "57194938393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55323514200": {"Name": "Jones M.", "AuthorID": "55323514200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Nottingham, University Park"}}}
