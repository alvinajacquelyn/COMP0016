Traditional techniques using biochemical, genetic or cell biological approaches have made important contributions to our understanding of cellular signaling. However, the single-gene approach does not take into account the full complexity of cell signaling. With the availability of omics techniques, great progress has been made in understanding signaling networks. Omics approaches can be classified into two categories: 'molecular profiling', including genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and interactome profiling; and 'molecular perturbation', including genetic and functional perturbations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Protein Array Analysis", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929297907", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57210508956": {"Name": "Yao Z.", "AuthorID": "57210508956", "AffiliationID": "60021600, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto"}, "7003416997": {"Name": "Stagljar I.", "AuthorID": "7003416997", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto"}, "8644154600": {"Name": "Petschnigg J.", "AuthorID": "8644154600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC, Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6603482374": {"Name": "Ketteler R.", "AuthorID": "6603482374", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC, Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
