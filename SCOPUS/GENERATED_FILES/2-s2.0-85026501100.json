Here, we tested the ALE in relation to attributions of students who have committed plagiarism. British adults (N = 165) were shown one of eight vignette-photograph pairings varying in target sex (female/male), physical attractiveness (high/low), and transgression severity (serious/minor), and provided attributions of guilt and severity of punishment. Analyses of variance revealed significant interactions between attractiveness and transgression severity for both dependent measures. Attractive targets were perceived as guiltier and deserving of more severe punishments in the serious transgression condition, but there was no significant difference between attractive and less attractive targets in the minor transgression condition. These results are discussed in terms of a reverse attribution bias, in which attractive individuals are judged more negatively when they fail to live up to higher standards of conduct.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attractiveness bias", "Attractiveness-leniency effect", "Physical attractiveness", "Plagiarism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Beauty", "Body Image", "Female", "Guilt", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Plagiarism", "Punishment", "Sex Factors", "Social Perception", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026501100", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"10639213000": {"Name": "Swami V.", "AuthorID": "10639213000", "AffiliationID": "60106654", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychological Medicine, Perdana University, Serdang"}, "57195250289": {"Name": "Arthey E.", "AuthorID": "57195250289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Department of Leadership and Organizational Behaviour, Norwegian Business School"}}}
