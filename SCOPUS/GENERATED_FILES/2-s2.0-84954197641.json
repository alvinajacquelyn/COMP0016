The original description dates to 1962, when the autopsy was performed at the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, now Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. The heart was subsequently stored in the Farouk S. Idriss Cardiac Registry at the same institution. The specimen shows usual atrial arrangement, but with the morphologically left appendage juxtaposed in a rightward manner, passing behind the heart rather than through the transverse sinus so as to reach its location inferior to the morphologically right appendage. The heart also demonstrated an inter-atrial communication between the cavities of the juxtaposed left appendage and the morphologically right atrium. We provide a detailed description of the morphology, and provide images of this lesion, which to the best of our knowledge has not previously been described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anatomically corrected malposition", "Functionally univentricular heart", "inter-atrial communication", "left atrioventricular valvar atresia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atrial Appendage", "Cadaver", "Female", "Heart Septal Defects, Atrial", "Humans", "Infant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954197641", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56388747400": {"Name": "Sarwark A.E.", "AuthorID": "56388747400", "AffiliationID": "60017031", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgery, Ann and Robert H.
