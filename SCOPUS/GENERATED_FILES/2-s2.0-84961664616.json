All rights reserved.Background Abnormal liver enzymes are frequently encountered in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Infliximab has been implicated in inducing drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis or reactivation of hepatitis B virus. We aimed to clarify the role of infliximab in liver impairment in an IBD cohort. Study A total of 305 patients with IBD, without evidence of chronic liver disease, were included in the study and retrospectively evaluated. Laboratory and clinical data were retrieved from a prospectively acquired database. In all, 176 consecutive patients treated with infliximab during the last 5 years were compared with a matched population of 129 patients who did not receive any antitumour necrosis factor treatment. Results Elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) was frequent in the entire population (36.4%) and it was not significantly associated with the use of infliximab (P=0.284). Elevations more than 3 upper limit of normal were observed in 7.9% and these resolved spontaneously in 83%. The use of immunomodulators was the only factor that was significantly associated with liver enzyme abnormalities in multivariate analysis [odds ratio (OR) 2.666, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.576-4.511, P<0.005]. Overall, 39% of patients on infliximab had elevated liver enzymes and this was associated with increased ALT before starting infliximab (OR 3.854, 95% CI 1.800-8.251, P=0.001) and with longer duration of infliximab treatment (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.013-1.047, P=0.001). Conclusion Elevated liver enzymes are frequently found in IBD patients and they usually resolve spontaneously. The use of immunomodulators was independently associated with increased ALT. Infliximab is relatively safe in terms of liver impairment and discontinuation of treatment is rarely required in the setting of modest elevations of ALT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elevated liver enzymes", "hepatotoxicity", "inflammatory bowel disease", "infliximab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alanine Transaminase", "Biomarkers", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Clinical Enzyme Tests", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Agents", "Humans", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Infliximab", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961664616", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"49061264100": {"Name": "Parisi I.", "AuthorID": "49061264100", "AffiliationID": "60048838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Theageneio Hospital"}, "6701855309": {"Name": "O'Beirne J.", "AuthorID": "6701855309", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health"}, "16744202500": {"Name": "Manousou P.", "AuthorID": "16744202500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health"}, "37027349500": {"Name": "Theocharidou E.", "AuthorID": "37027349500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health"}, "56450243500": {"Name": "Burroughs A.K.", "AuthorID": "56450243500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health"}, "55198585100": {"Name": "Rossi R.E.", "AuthorID": "55198585100", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60007067", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "16180164500": {"Name": "Hamilton M.", "AuthorID": "16180164500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57202223898": {"Name": "Murray C.", "AuthorID": "57202223898", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005380928": {"Name": "Epstein O.", "AuthorID": "7005380928", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
