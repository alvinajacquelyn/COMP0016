This paper presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention, What Were We Thinking (WWWT), for the prevention of postnatal maternal mental health problems. Design: The economic evaluation, including cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, was conducted alongside a cluster-randomised trial. Setting: 48 Maternal and Child Health Centres in Victoria, Australia. Participants: Participants were English-speaking first-time mothers attending participating Maternal and Child Health Centres. Full data were collected for 175 participants in the control arm and 184 in the intervention arm. Intervention: WWWT is a psychoeducational intervention targeted at the partner relationship, management of infant behaviour and parental fatigue. Outcome measures: The evaluation considered public sector plus participant out-of-pocket costs, while outcomes were expressed in the 30-day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental costs and outcomes were estimated using regression analyses to account for relevant sociodemographic, prognostic and clinical characteristics. Results: The intervention was estimated to cost $A118.16 per participant. The analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups in costs or outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $A36 451 per QALY gained and $A152 per percentage-point reduction in 30-day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. The estimate lies under the unofficial cost-effectiveness threshold of $A55 000 per QALY; however, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the results, with a 55% probability that WWWT would be considered cost-effective at that threshold. Conclusions: The results suggest that, although WWWT shows promise as a preventive intervention for postnatal maternal mental health problems, further research is required to reduce the uncertainty over its cost-effectiveness as there were no statistically significant differences in costs or outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cost-effectiveness", "Economic evaluation", "MENTAL HEALTH", "Postnatal depression", "Prevention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Anxiety", "Behavior Therapy", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Depression, Postpartum", "Female", "Health Expenditures", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Maternal Health", "Mental Health", "Patient Education as Topic", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Public Sector", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Victoria"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996922086", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56382960600": {"Name": "Ride J.", "AuthorID": "56382960600", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, Monash University"}, "14038950500": {"Name": "Lorgelly P.", "AuthorID": "14038950500", "AffiliationID": "101862198", "AffiliationName": "Office of Health Economics"}, "37040900900": {"Name": "Tran T.", "AuthorID": "37040900900", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, Monash University"}, "24578160000": {"Name": "Wynter K.", "AuthorID": "24578160000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, Monash University"}, "35293556100": {"Name": "Rowe H.", "AuthorID": "35293556100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, Monash University"}, "7404016774": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "7404016774", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, Monash University"}}}
