Computer analysis of CT features was used to identify a subset of CHP patients with an outcome similar to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Methods: Consecutive patients with a multi-disciplinary team diagnosis of CHP (n=116) had pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, DLco, Kco, and a composite physiologic index [CPI]) and CT variables predictive of mortality evaluated by analysing visual and computer-based (CALIPER) parenchymal features: total interstitial lung disease (ILD) extent, honeycombing, reticular pattern, ground glass opacities, pulmonary vessel volume (PVV), emphysema, and traction bronchiectasis. Mean survival was compared between both CHP and IPF patients (n=185). Results: In CHP, visual/CALIPER measures of reticular pattern, honeycombing, visual traction bronchiectasis, and CALIPER ILD extent were predictive of mortality (p<0.05) on univariate analysis. PVV was strongly predictive of mortality on univariate (p<0.0001) and multivariate analysis independent of age, gender and disease severity (represented by the CPI [p<0.01]). CHP patients with a PVV threshold >6.5% of the lung had a mean survival (35.3\u00b16.1months; n=20/116 [17%]) and rate of disease progression that closely matched IPF patients (38.4\u00b12.2months; n=185). Conclusions: Pulmonary vessel volume can identify CHP patients at risk of aggressive disease and a poor IPF-like prognosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "Pulmonary vessel volume", "Quantitative CT analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alveolitis, Extrinsic Allergic", "Blood Volume", "Chronic Disease", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pulmonary Alveoli", "Pulmonary Circulation", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Severity of Illness Index", "Survival Analysis", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019152791", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57200973324": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57200973324", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology"}, "24069928400": {"Name": "Brun A.L.", "AuthorID": "24069928400", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology"}, "7102078625": {"Name": "Hansell D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102078625", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Radiology"}, "6602803945": {"Name": "Bartholmai B.J.", "AuthorID": "6602803945", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic Rochester, Division of Radiology"}, "6701782045": {"Name": "Egashira R.", "AuthorID": "6701782045", "AffiliationID": "60165278, 60019983", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Department of Radiology"}, "8596434600": {"Name": "Rajagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "8596434600", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic Rochester, Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering"}, "6603861094": {"Name": "Karwoski R.", "AuthorID": "6603861094", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic Rochester, Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Interstitial Lung Disease Unit"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Interstitial Lung Disease Unit"}}}
