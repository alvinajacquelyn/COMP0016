Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.A stainless-steel mesh loaded with nickel catalyst was produced and used for the pyrolysis\u2013catalysis of waste high-density polyethylene with the aim of producing high-value carbon products, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The catalysis temperature and plastic-to-catalyst ratio were investigated to determine the influence on the formation of different types of carbon deposited on the nickel\u2013stainless-steel mesh catalyst. Increasing temperature from 700 to 900\u00b0C resulted in an increase in the carbon deposited on the nickel-loaded stainless-steel mesh catalyst from 32.5 to 38.0 wt%. The increase in sample-to-catalyst ratio reduced the amount of carbon deposited on the mesh catalyst in terms of g carbon g\u22121 plastic. The carbons were found to be largely composed of filamentous carbons, with negligible disordered (amorphous) carbons. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the filamentous carbons revealed them to be composed of a large proportion (estimated at \u223c40%) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The optimum process conditions for CNT production, in terms of yield and graphitic nature, determined by Raman spectroscopy, was catalysis temperature of 800\u00b0C and plastic-to-catalyst ratio of 1:2, where a mass of 334 mg of filamentous/MWCNTs g\u22121 plastic was produced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon nanotubes", "catalysis", "Polyethylene", "pyrolysis", "waste"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon products", "Catalyst ratios", "Filamentous carbon", "Increasing temperatures", "Nickel catalyst", "Optimum process conditions", "Stainless steel mesh", "Transmission electron", "Catalysis", "Environmental Pollutants", "Incineration", "Nanotubes, Carbon", "Nickel", "Polyethylene", "Stainless Steel"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011565067", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"]], "AuthorData": {"56662820300": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56662820300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical & Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "36129840500": {"Name": "Nahil M.A.", "AuthorID": "36129840500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical & Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7404956386": {"Name": "Williams P.T.", "AuthorID": "7404956386", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical & Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "14424662900": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "14424662900", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Hull"}}}
