We aimed to describe the epidemiology of mental health-related ED attendances within health care systems free at the point of access, including clinical reason for presentation, previous service use, and patient sociodemographic characteristics. Method Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies describing ED attendances by patients with common mental health conditions. Findings 18 studies from seven countries met eligibility criteria. Patients attending due to mental or behavioural health disorders accounted for 4% of ED attendances; a third were due to self-harm or suicidal ideation. 58.1% of attendees had a history of psychiatric illness and up to 58% were admitted. The majority of studies were single site and of low quality so results must be interpreted cautiously. Conclusions Prevalence studies of mental health-related ED attendances are required to enable the development of services to meet specific needs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Australia", "Canada", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Europe", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Prevalence", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Suicidal Ideation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016007699", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56114248400": {"Name": "Barratt H.", "AuthorID": "56114248400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "36834426700": {"Name": "Rojas-Garc\u00eda A.", "AuthorID": "36834426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "56611388300": {"Name": "Clarke K.", "AuthorID": "56611388300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness (CORE), Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004038377": {"Name": "Whittington C.", "AuthorID": "7004038377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness (CORE), Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6701418714": {"Name": "Pilling S.", "AuthorID": "6701418714", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness (CORE), Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56393632400": {"Name": "Moore A.", "AuthorID": "56393632400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "37113000000": {"Name": "Stockton S.", "AuthorID": "37113000000", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "55574208395": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208395", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education EPPI-Centre"}}}
