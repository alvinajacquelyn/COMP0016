A mixed method systematic review was undertaken to explore the factors shaping the discussion of FP with children (0\u201315 years) and adolescents/young adults (16\u201324 years) with cancer. Methods: Six databases were searched independently using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary/subject headings relating to cancer and fertility. Inclusion criteria consisted of: (a) being published in a peer-reviewed journal, (b) a focus on healthcare professionals' (HCPs') beliefs, attitudes, or practices regarding fertility issues in cancer patients, (c) primary data collection from HCPs, and (d) a focus on HCPs who provide services to young patients. Of the 6276 articles identified in the search, 16 articles presenting the results of 14 studies were included in the final review. Results: Common themes reported across studies indicate that five main factors influence HCPs' discussion of FP with young cancer patients: (a) HCPs' knowledge, (b) HCPs' sense of comfort, (c) patient factors (i.e., sexual maturity, prognosis, partnership status, and whether or not they initiate the conversation), (d) parent factors (i.e., HCPs' perception of the extent of their involvement), and (e) availability of educational materials. Conclusions: Future work should ensure that HCPs possess knowledge of cancer-related FP and that they receive adequate training on how to consent and discuss information with young patients and their parents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Child", "Female", "Fertility", "Fertility Preservation", "Health Education", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Prognosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960194593", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37075880600": {"Name": "Vindrola-Padros C.", "AuthorID": "37075880600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57183787200": {"Name": "Dyer K.", "AuthorID": "57183787200", "AffiliationID": "60002476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Behavior and Policy, Virginia Commonwealth University"}, "55200482300": {"Name": "Cyrus J.", "AuthorID": "55200482300", "AffiliationID": "60002476", "AffiliationName": "Tompkins-McCaw Library, Virginia Commonwealth University Libraries"}, "36195021400": {"Name": "Lubker I.", "AuthorID": "36195021400", "AffiliationID": "60002476", "AffiliationName": "Tompkins-McCaw Library, Virginia Commonwealth University Libraries"}}}
