Representative samples from the sites of Shaqadud Midden and Shaqadud S21 at the British Museum have also been re-examined. The aims of these activities were threefold: to test the reliability and cohesiveness of and patterning in the Shaqadud collection through the expanded application of attribute analysis, to determine if Caneva's observations of d\u00e9cor patterns on Jebel Moya's Late Mesolithic sherds could be replicated and to obtain better visibility into the nature of its pottery assemblage from this time, and to use the resulting data to test the viability of the central Sudan being a fulcrum of cultural interchanges during the late sixth and early fifth millennium BC. We conclude that there was a piecemeal establishment of networks along which there was diffusion of ideas and animals, and perhaps low numbers of people, into the central and south-central Sudan.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049759114", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"55916337600": {"Name": "Brass M.", "AuthorID": "55916337600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57204214969": {"Name": "Adam A.H.A.", "AuthorID": "57204214969", "AffiliationID": "60071723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Khartoum"}, "57204217332": {"Name": "Wellings J.", "AuthorID": "57204217332", "AffiliationID": "116218714", "AffiliationName": "Independent Researcher"}}}
