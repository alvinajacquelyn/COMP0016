This steel contains chemical segregation inherited from the casting process. Our previously developed 3D cellular automaton model allowed us to design thermo-mechanical processes to either promote or suppress banding. The bands are properly described as in-plane sheets of martensite grains. Mechanical testing data revealed a significant reduction in tensile strength in banded structures for a similar level of ductility. The work-hardening behaviour in the pre-yield regime, including the yield strength itself, is not correlated to the incidence of segregation and/or microstructural banding. The reduction in ultimate tensile strength in banded structures stems from a reduced work-hardening capacity in the post-yield regime. This is due to increased austenite stability in the banded steels, coupled to the anisotropic strain localisation in the ferritic matrix between martensite bands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Austenite", "Hardening", "Martensite", "Mechanical characterization", "Steel", "Thermo-mechanical processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["3d cellular automaton", "Chemical segregation", "Mechanical characterizations", "Microstructural banding", "Thermo-mechanical processing", "Thermomechanical process", "Ultimate tensile strength", "Work hardening behaviours"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040079524", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57189576823": {"Name": "Ennis B.L.", "AuthorID": "57189576823", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "The School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "54916652700": {"Name": "Bos C.", "AuthorID": "54916652700", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel Research and Development"}, "57213314751": {"Name": "Aarnts M.P.", "AuthorID": "57213314751", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel Research and Development"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester X-Ray Imaging Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "15725349200": {"Name": "Jimenez-Melero E.", "AuthorID": "15725349200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "The School of Materials, University of Manchester"}}}
