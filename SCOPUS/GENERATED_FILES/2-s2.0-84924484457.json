In this study, we compare the placental metabolomic profile in the first, second and third trimesters to determine whether the energy demands are adequately met in the first trimester. We investigated whether hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1a and/or HIF-2a, might regulate transcription during the first trimester. First and second trimester tissue was collected using a chorionic villus sampling- like (CVS) technique. Part of each villus sample was frozen immediately and the remainder cultured under 2 or 21%O2\u00b11 mMH2O2, and +the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, PD169316. Levels of HIF-1a were assessed by western blotting and VEGFA, PlGF and GLUT3 transcripts were quantified by RT-PCR. Term samples were collected from normal elective Caesarean deliveries. There were no significant differences in concentrations of ADP, NAD+, lactate, and glucose, and in the ATP/ADP ratio, across gestational age. Neither HIF-1a nor HIF-2a could be detected in time-zero CVS samples. However, culture under any condition (2 or 21% O2\u00b11 mM H2O2) increased HIF-1a and HIF-2a. HIF-1a and HIF-2a were additionally detected in specimens retrieved after curettage. HIF-1a stabilization was accompanied by significant increases in VEGFA and GLUT3 and a decrease in PlGF mRNAs. These effects were suppressed by PD169316. In conclusion, our data suggest that first trimester placental tissues are not energetically compromised, and that HIF-1a is unlikely to play an appreciable role in regulating transcriptional activity under steady-state conditions in vivo. However, the pathway may be activated by stress conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy status", "First trimester", "HIF-1a", "Metabolomics", "Placenta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Diphosphate", "Adenosine Triphosphate", "Adult", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Cell Hypoxia", "Chorionic Villi", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Glucose Transporter Type 3", "Humans", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Imidazoles", "Membrane Proteins", "Oxygen", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Placentation", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimesters", "Primary Cell Culture", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription, Genetic", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924484457", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6505931329": {"Name": "Cindrova-Davies T.", "AuthorID": "6505931329", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "6505785864": {"Name": "Tissot Van Patot M.", "AuthorID": "6505785864", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7201375692": {"Name": "Gardner L.", "AuthorID": "7201375692", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7201844309": {"Name": "Burton G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201844309", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57215575828": {"Name": "Charnock-Jones D.S.", "AuthorID": "57215575828", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Cambridge Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal Free and University College"}}}
