Here we present data suggesting that treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis, a model organism widely used for the screening of antituberculosis agents, with first-line drugs resulted in the generation of substantial populations that could be recovered only by the addition of a culture supernatant from growing mycobacteria. These bacilli failed to grow in standard media, resulting in significant underestimation of the numbers of viable mycobacteria in treated samples. We generated M. smegmatis strains overexpressing M. tuberculosis resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs) and demonstrated their application for the detection of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria generated after drug exposure. Our data offer novel opportunities for validation of the sterilizing activity of antituberculosis agents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Proteins", "Bacteriological Techniques", "Culture Media", "Cytokines", "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Mycobacterium smegmatis", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992655511", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56872617400": {"Name": "Loraine J.", "AuthorID": "56872617400", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57191745540": {"Name": "Pu F.", "AuthorID": "57191745540", "AffiliationID": "113874104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Training, Diagnostics Division, Siemens China"}, "6507575732": {"Name": "Turapov O.", "AuthorID": "6507575732", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}, "6603277647": {"Name": "Mukamolova G.", "AuthorID": "6603277647", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}}}
