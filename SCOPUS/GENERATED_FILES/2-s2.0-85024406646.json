The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We report here the analysis of the near-infrared transit spectrum of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b, which was recorded with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. HAT-P-32b is one of the most inflated exoplanets discovered, making it an excellent candidate for transit spectroscopic measurements. To obtain the transit spectrum, we have adopted different analysis methods, both parametric and non-parametric (Independent Component Analysis, ICA), and compared the results. The final spectra are all consistent within 0.5\u03c3. The uncertainties obtained with ICA are larger than those obtained with the parametric method by a factor of \u223c1.6-1.8. This difference is the trade-off for higher objectivity due to the lack of any assumption about the instrument systematics compared to the parametric approach. The ICA error bars are therefore worst-case estimates. To interpret the spectrum of HAT-P-32b we used -REx, our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code. As for other hot Jupiters, the results are consistent with the presence of water vapor (log H2O -3.45 1.83-1.65), clouds (top pressure between 5.16 and 1.73 bar). Spectroscopic data over a broader wavelength range are needed to de-correlate the mixing ratio of water vapor from clouds and identify other possible molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-32b.", "AuthorKeywords": ["methods: data analysis", "planets and satellites: atmospheres", "planets and satellites: individual (HAT-P-32 b)", "techniques: spectroscopic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024406646", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57188752800": {"Name": "Damiano M.", "AuthorID": "57188752800", "AffiliationID": "60030106, 60073811", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo"}, "56121361100": {"Name": "Morello G.", "AuthorID": "56121361100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57188766482": {"Name": "Tsiaras A.", "AuthorID": "57188766482", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57191530927": {"Name": "Zingales T.", "AuthorID": "57191530927", "AffiliationID": "60030106, 60073811", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo"}, "55893633200": {"Name": "Tinetti G.", "AuthorID": "55893633200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
