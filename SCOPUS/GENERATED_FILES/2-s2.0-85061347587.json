While the earliest white matter changes are seen around the striatum, within the corpus callosum, and in the posterior white matter tracts, the order in which these changes occur and why these white matter connections are specifically vulnerable is unclear. Here, we use diffusion tractography in a longitudinal cohort of individuals yet to develop clinical symptoms of HD to identify a hierarchy of vulnerability, where the topological length of white matter connections between a brain area and its neighbors predicts the rate of atrophy over 24 months. This demonstrates a new principle underlying neurodegeneration in HD, whereby brain connections with the greatest topological length are the first to suffer damage that can account for the stereotyped pattern of white matter loss observed in premanifest HD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neuroscience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061347587", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24391059400": {"Name": "McColgan P.", "AuthorID": "24391059400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "56785241700": {"Name": "Gregory S.", "AuthorID": "56785241700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "56118589600": {"Name": "Papoutsi M.", "AuthorID": "56118589600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "57208140593": {"Name": "Johnson E.", "AuthorID": "57208140593", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.I.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24823693800": {"Name": "Seunarine K.K.", "AuthorID": "24823693800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "25031569200": {"Name": "Razi A.", "AuthorID": "25031569200", "AffiliationID": "60060302", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, NED University of Engineering and Technology"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7403447437": {"Name": "Long J.D.", "AuthorID": "7403447437", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Iowa"}, "8585658900": {"Name": "Mills J.A.", "AuthorID": "8585658900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry"}, "24741153500": {"Name": "Durr A.", "AuthorID": "24741153500", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60120341, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP Department of Genetics, University Hospital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) INSERM U1127, CNRS UMR7225"}, "7203053136": {"Name": "Roos R.A.", "AuthorID": "7203053136", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "7005869634": {"Name": "Leavitt B.R.", "AuthorID": "7005869634", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "57205413781": {"Name": "Stout J.C.", "AuthorID": "57205413781", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University"}, "57207301853": {"Name": "Investigators T.T.O.H.", "AuthorID": "57207301853", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Track-On HD Investigators are detailed in the Supplemental Acknowledgments"}}}
