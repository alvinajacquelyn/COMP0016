We think this is a central question in the theory of anony-mous communication and to the best of our knowledge this is the first formal study in this direction. Towards this goal, we introduce the novel concept of anony-mous steganography: Think of a leaker Lea who wants to leak a large document to Joe the journalist. Using anonymous steganography Lea can embed this document in innocent looking communication on some popular website (such as cat videos on YouTube or funny memes on 9GAG). Then Lea provides Joe with a short decoding key dk which, when applied to the entire website, recovers the document while hiding the identity of Lea among the large number of users of the website. Our contributions include: Introducing and formally defining anonymous stega-nography, A construction showing that anonymous steganogra-phy is possible (which uses recent results in circuits obfuscation), A lower bound on the number of bits which are needed to bootstrap anonymous communication.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anonymous communication", "Formal studies", "Large amounts", "Lower bounds", "Novel concept", "YouTube"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966642614", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56023212600": {"Name": "Jakobsen S.K.", "AuthorID": "56023212600", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences and School, Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "26646817800": {"Name": "Orlandi C.", "AuthorID": "26646817800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University"}}}
