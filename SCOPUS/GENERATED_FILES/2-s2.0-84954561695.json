In this work we created four video clips with a Virtual Character walking, but with different combinations of either child or adult animation applied on either a child or adult body. An experimental study was conducted with 53 participants who viewed all four videos in random orders. The results show that participants could easily identify the consistent video clips (child animation with child body, and adult animation with adult body). With the inconsistent video clips, both animation and body shape had an effect on participants' judgments. They also reported higher level of empathy, care, and feeling of protection towards the child character as compared to the adult character. Finally, compared to appearance, animation seems to be playing a bigger role in invoking participants' emotional responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer Animation", "User Study", "Virtual Characters"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body shapes", "Computer animation", "Emotional response", "User study", "Video clips", "Virtual character", "Virtual representations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954561695", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"57063275600": {"Name": "Khantong R.", "AuthorID": "57063275600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23390192600": {"Name": "Pan X.", "AuthorID": "23390192600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7202932472": {"Name": "Slater M.", "AuthorID": "7202932472", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL and ICREA, University College London"}}}
