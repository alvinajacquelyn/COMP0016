Implementing such soft segments allows to surpass the rigidity of conventional robots and ensures safer workspaces where humans and machines can work side by side with less stringent safety restrictions. Therefore, we used a hydrogel as viscoelastic material consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol) and borax. The mechanical properties of the hydrogel were tailored by embedding silica particles of various particles sizes as well as in different mass fractions. Increased mass contents as well as larger particle sizes led to strongly enhanced rigidity with a more than doubled storage modulus of the composite compared to the pure hydrogel. Furthermore, specific functionalities were induced by the incorporation of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles that can in principle be used for sensing robotic motion and detecting malfunctions. Therefore, we precisely adjusted the saturation magnetization of the soft segments using defined mass contents of the nanoparticles. To ensure long-time shape stability and prevention of atmospheric influences on the prepared composites, a silicone skin of specific shore hardness was used. The composites and the soft segments were characterized by oscillation measurements, cryo-SEM, bending tests and SQUID measurements, which give insights into the properties in the passive and in the moving state of SpineMan. The utilization of tailored composites led to highly flexible, reinforced and functional soft segments, which ensure stability, easy movability by springs of the shape memory alloy nitinol and prevention of total failure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conventional robots", "Fe3O4 nanoparticles", "Larger particle sizes", "Oscillation measurements", "Particle reinforced", "Robotic manipulators", "Superparamagnetics", "Visco-elastic material"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056635550", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"6508004352": {"Name": "Preller T.", "AuthorID": "6508004352", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "56728123500": {"Name": "Zellmer S.", "AuthorID": "56728123500", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "57204673871": {"Name": "Azimi Saein S.", "AuthorID": "57204673871", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "6506992890": {"Name": "Garnweitner G.", "AuthorID": "6506992890", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Emerging Nanometrology (LENA), Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "55486407100": {"Name": "Runge G.", "AuthorID": "55486407100", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Assembly Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "57202942676": {"Name": "Peters J.", "AuthorID": "57202942676", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Assembly Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "6506437925": {"Name": "Raatz A.", "AuthorID": "6506437925", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Assembly Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "24503624200": {"Name": "Menzel D.", "AuthorID": "24503624200", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Condensed Matter Physics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "6602515325": {"Name": "Tiersch B.", "AuthorID": "6602515325", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Universit\u00e4t Potsdam"}, "6603597474": {"Name": "Koetz J.", "AuthorID": "6603597474", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Universit\u00e4t Potsdam"}}}
