All rights reserved.The fifteenth-century carol An aungell fro heuen gan lyth is remarkable for the way in which it explores the Economy of Salvation and the triune power of the Godhead through the iconographic motif of the Trinitarian knot. This motif, derived from the \u201cthreefold cord\u201d which \u201cis not easily broken\u201d (Eccles. 4.12), was developed by Petrus Alfonsi, Joachim of Fiore, and Dante in a Trinitarian context. An aungell fro heuen gan lyth is not only informed by this complex strand of Trinitarian iconology, but is also notable for its sophisticated handling of the motif. The Trinitarian knot is central to the carol\u2019s burden, but also recurs throughout the five stanzas, where it serves as a meditative device which celebrates the five great mysteries of faith enshrined in the Apostles\u2019 Creed. These mysteries, described in turn through the narrative progression of the carol, are encapsulated in successive variations on the Trinitarian knot.", "AuthorKeywords": ["An aungell fro heuen gan lyth", "Apostles\u2019 Creed", "Ascension", "Crucifixion", "Incarnation", "Last Judgment", "Middle English carol", "Resurrection", "Trinitarian iconology", "Trinitarian knot"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942307425", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"56870736600": {"Name": "Jones N.", "AuthorID": "56870736600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of English Language and Literature, University College London"}}}
