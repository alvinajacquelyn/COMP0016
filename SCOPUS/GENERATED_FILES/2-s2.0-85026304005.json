The approximation shows how the error contaminated and error free quantile regression functions are related. A key factor is the distribution of the error free explanatory variable. Exact calculations probe the accuracy of the approximation. The order of the approximation error is unchanged if the density of the error free explanatory variable is replaced by the density of the error contaminated explanatory variable which is easily estimated. It is then possible to use the approximation to investigate the sensitivity of estimates to varying amounts of measurement error.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Measurement error", "Parameter approximations", "Quantile regression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximation errors", "Effect of measurements", "Exact calculations", "Explanatory variables", "Key factors", "Parameter approximations", "Quantile regression"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026304005", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6602621049": {"Name": "Chesher A.", "AuthorID": "6602621049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
