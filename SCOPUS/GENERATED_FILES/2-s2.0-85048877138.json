The estimated prevalence of all urethral stricture in the UK is 10/100,000 men during youth, increasing to about 40/100,000 by age 65 years and to more than 100/100,000 thereafter. A penile urethral stricture is a narrowing of the lumen of the urethra due to ischaemic fibrosis of the urethral epithelium and/or spongiofibrosis of the corpus spongiosum occurring within the penile urethra. Its aetiology is largely idiopathic but other important causes are failed hypospadias repair and lichen sclerosus, which account for 60% of all cases. Strictures of the anterior urethra account for 92% of cases: bulbar strictures are more frequent (46.9%), followed by penile (30.5%) and combined bulbar/penile (9.9%), that is, 40.4% of all men presenting with stricture will have a penile urethral stricture alone or in combination with a bulbar urethral stricture. There are several options for the treatment of penile urethral strictures ranging from less invasive treatments, including urethral dilatation and direct vision internal urethrotomy, to more complex augmentation graft and flap urethroplasty. The aim of the present review is to describe the aetiology and epidemiology of anterior urethral strictures and the available options reported in literature for their treatment.
