All such methods are based on the principle of reactive listening of periodic fire messages. The advantage of distributed desynchronization (DESYNC-TDMA) is the fact that it comprises a decentralized approach of very low complexity. It is therefore of significant interest to attempt to implement DESYNC-TDMA in an actual network. In this paper, we propose distributed desynchronization in a multi-hop wireless sensor network setting. The key contribution is therefore that the primitive of desynchronization has been extended to a multi-hop DESYNC-TDMA algorithm. Our implementation in a real world wireless sensor network provided measurements of the bandwidth efficiency and the expected delay until convergence to steady state is achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Desynchronization", "Multi-hop Networks", "Wireless Sensor Networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bandwidth efficiency", "Convergence to steady state", "Decentralized approach", "Desynchronization", "Distributed time", "Multihop networks", "Time division multiple accesses (TDMA)", "Very low complexity"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962174331", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55279780900": {"Name": "Buranapanichkit D.", "AuthorID": "55279780900", "AffiliationID": "60006314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Prince of Songkla University"}, "57207530477": {"Name": "Andreopoulos Y.", "AuthorID": "57207530477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
