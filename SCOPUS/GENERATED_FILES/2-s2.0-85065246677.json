Wild type DJ-1 can acts as oxidative stress sensor and as an antioxidant. DJ-1 exhibits the properties of molecular chaperone, protease, glyoxalase, transcriptional regulator that protects mitochondria from oxidative stress. DJ-1 increases the expression of two mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP 4 and UCP5), that decrease mitochondrial membrane potential and leads to the suppression of ROS production, optimizes of a number of mitochondrial functions, and is regarded as protection for the neuronal cell survival. We discuss also the stabilizing interaction of DJ-1 with the mitochondrial Bcl-xL protein, which regulates the activity of (Inositol trisphosphate receptor) IP3R, prevents the cytochrome c release from mitochondria and inhibits the apoptosis activation. Upon oxidative stress DJ-1 is able to regulate various transcription factors including nuclear factor Nrf2, PI3K/PKB, and p53 signal pathways. Stress-activated transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the pathways to protect cells against oxidative stress and metabolic pathways initiating the NADPH and ATP production. DJ-1 induces the Nrf2 dissociation from its inhibitor Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation and binding to antioxidant response elements. DJ-1 is shown to be a co-activator of the transcription factor NF-kB. Under nitrosative stress, DJ-1 may regulate PI3K/PKB signaling through PTEN transnitrosylation, which leads to inhibition of phosphatase activity. DJ-1 has a complex modulating effect on the p53 pathway: one side DJ-1 directly binds to p53 to restore its transcriptional activity and on the other hand DJ-1 can stimulate deacylation and suppress p53 transcriptional activity. The ability of the DJ-1 to induce activation of different transcriptional factors and change redox balance protect neurons against aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and oligomer-induced neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DJ-1", "mitochondria", "neurodegeneration", "oxidative stress", "Parkinson\u2019s disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Humans", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mitochondria", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Deglycase DJ-1", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065246677", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6701457190": {"Name": "Dolgacheva L.P.", "AuthorID": "6701457190", "AffiliationID": "60110604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biophysics Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7801310788": {"Name": "Berezhnov A.V.", "AuthorID": "7801310788", "AffiliationID": "60110604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biophysics Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "8332225800": {"Name": "Fedotova E.I.", "AuthorID": "8332225800", "AffiliationID": "60110604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biophysics Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7102936099": {"Name": "Zinchenko V.P.", "AuthorID": "7102936099", "AffiliationID": "60110604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biophysics Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
