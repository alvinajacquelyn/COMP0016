Drug repurposing attempts to determine new indications for pre-existing compounds and represents a major opportunity to address this clinically unmet need. It is potentially more cost-effective and time-efficient than de novo drug development and has yielded notable successes in neurological disorders. However, across all medical disciplines, only 30% of repurposed drugs, and 10% of novel candidate molecules, gain market approval. One potentially significant contributor towards this limited success rate is an incomplete knowledge of the exposure-response relationships for the compounds of interest, and how these relate to the new indication, prior to commencing a new trial. We provide an overview of the current approach to early-stage drug repurposing and consider the issues contributing to inconclusive, or possibly falsely negative, Phase II and III trial outcomes in neurological diseases by highlighting examples that illustrate the limitations of empirical evidence generation without a strong scientific basis for the dose rationale. We conclude with a framework suggesting a translational, iterative approach, that integrates pharmacological, pharmaceutical and clinical expertise, towards preclinical and early clinical drug development. This ensures appropriate dosing regimen, route of administration and/or formulation are selected for the new indication before their evaluation in prospective clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical trials", "dose rationale", "formulation", "neurological diseases", "Pharmacodynamics", "Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic", "Pharmacokinetics", "repositioning", "repurposing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Drug Repositioning", "Humans", "Nervous System Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067129433", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55750675600": {"Name": "Clout A.E.", "AuthorID": "55750675600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57193742036": {"Name": "Orlu M.", "AuthorID": "57193742036", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Modelling and Simulation, GlaxoSmithKline"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.G.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "24475469100": {"Name": "Pitceathly R.D.S.", "AuthorID": "24475469100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
