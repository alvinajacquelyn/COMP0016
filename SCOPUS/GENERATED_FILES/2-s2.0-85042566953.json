A patient with virologically controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection presented with a \u2018numb chin\u2019 on the background of long-standing night sweats, malaise and weight loss, worsening respiratory symptoms, and lymphadenopathy. Burkitt non-Hodgkin lymphoma was diagnosed from histology of a lymph node. Imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and 18fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-positron emission tomography-computed tomography [PET-CT]) showed abnormal intracranial enhancement of the right mandibular nerve and extensive 18FDG-avid lymphadenopathy above and below the diaphragm, focal lesions in the spleen and within the right mandible. The patient received chemotherapy and remains in clinical and radiological remission seven years later. This case highlights the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy when an HIV-infected patient presents with new onset of a \u2018numb chin\u2019. Additionally, it demonstrates the importance of functional 18FDG-PET-CT and neuroimaging in order to identify site(s) of pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computerised tomography", "Burkitt", "human immunodeficiency virus", "lymphoma", "mental neuropathy", "numb chin syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Burkitt Lymphoma", "Chin", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "HIV Seropositivity", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042566953", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57197160514": {"Name": "Vora N.", "AuthorID": "57197160514", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "T8, University College London Hospitals Foundation Trust"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Public Health, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57200880743": {"Name": "Haryee H.", "AuthorID": "57200880743", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging, University College London Hospitals Foundation Trust"}, "57221386613": {"Name": "Dickson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57221386613", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals Foundation Trust"}}}
