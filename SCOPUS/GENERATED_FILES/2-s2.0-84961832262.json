{"Title": "Hypoxia-induced nitric oxide production and tumour perfusion is inhibited by pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20)", "Year": 2016, "Source": "Sci. Rep.", "Volume": "6", "Issue": null, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 15, "DOI": "10.1038/srep22950", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84961832262&origin=inward", "Abstract": "The hypoxic tumour microenvironment represents an aggressive, therapy-resistant compartment. As arginine is required for specific hypoxia-induced processes, we hypothesised that arginine-deprivation therapy may be useful in targeting hypoxic cancer cells. We explored the effects of the arginine-degrading agent ADI-PEG20 on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activation, the hypoxia-induced nitric oxide (NO) pathway and proliferation using HCT116 and UMUC3 cells and xenografts. The latter lack argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) making them auxotrophic for arginine. In HCT116 cells, ADI-PEG20 inhibited hypoxic-activation of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, leading to decreased inducible-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NO-production, and VEGF. Interestingly, combining hypoxia and ADI-PEG20 synergistically inhibited ASS1. ADI-PEG20 inhibited mTORC1 and activated the unfolded protein response providing a mechanism for inhibition of HIF and ASS1. ADI-PEG20 inhibited tumour growth, impaired hypoxia-associated NO-production, and decreased vascular perfusion. Expression of HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1/iNOS and VEGF were reduced, despite an increased hypoxic tumour fraction. Similar effects were observed in UMUC3 xenografts. In summary, ADI-PEG20 inhibits HIF-activated processes in two tumour models with widely different arginine biology. Thus, ADI-PEG20 may be useful in the clinic to target therapy-resistant hypoxic cells in ASS1-proficient tumours and ASS1-deficient tumours.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Arginine", "Argininosuccinate Synthase", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Blotting, Western", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Line, Tumor", "HCT116 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrolases", "Hypoxia", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Mice, SCID", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Neoplasms", "Nitric Oxide", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II", "Perfusion", "Polyethylene Glycols", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Tumor Burden", "Unfolded Protein Response", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961832262", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36196183900": {"Name": "Burrows N.", "AuthorID": "36196183900", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "35399996300": {"Name": "Maxwell P.", "AuthorID": "35399996300", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57213665252": {"Name": "Cane G.", "AuthorID": "57213665252", "AffiliationID": "116477398", "AffiliationName": "Sprint Bioscience"}, "7005501517": {"Name": "Ashcroft M.", "AuthorID": "7005501517", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Clifford Allbutt Building"}, "15623625300": {"Name": "Robson M.", "AuthorID": "15623625300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Biology Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7006757998": {"Name": "Pedley R.", "AuthorID": "7006757998", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Biology Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55785302600": {"Name": "Gaude E.", "AuthorID": "55785302600", "AffiliationID": "60120019, 60031668, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, Hutchison/MRC Research Centre"}, "6505487116": {"Name": "Frezza C.", "AuthorID": "6505487116", "AffiliationID": "60120019, 60031668, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, Hutchison/MRC Research Centre"}, "6506020964": {"Name": "Howat W.", "AuthorID": "6506020964", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120009", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology/ISH, Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "6603157292": {"Name": "Szlosarek P.", "AuthorID": "6603157292", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
