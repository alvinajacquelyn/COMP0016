The current meta-analysis investigates if these contradictory findings are a result of differences between studies in methodological approaches towards the assessment of stress and depression. Methods After performing a systematic database search (February to December 2016), first, a meta-analysis was used to investigate the total effect size and publication bias. Second, stratified meta-analyses were used to investigate the potential moderating influence of different methodological approaches on heterogeneity of study findings. Third, a meta-regression was used to investigate the combined influence of the methodological approaches on the overall effect size. Results Results showed a small but significant effect of 5-HTTLPR in interaction with stress in the prediction of depression (OR[95%CI] = 1.18[1.09; 1.28], n = 48 effect sizes from 51 studies, totaling 51,449 participants). There was no evidence of publication bias. Heterogeneity of effect sizes was a result of outliers and not due to different methodological approaches towards the assessment of stress and depression. Yet, there was some evidence that studies adopting a categorical and interview approach to the assessment of stress report higher GxE effects, but further replication of this finding is needed. Limitations A large amount of heterogeneity (i.e., 46%) was not explained by the methodological factors included in the study and there was a low response rate of invited studies. Conclusions The current meta-analysis provides new evidence for the robustness of the interaction between stress and 5-HTTLPR in depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5-HTTLPR", "Depression", "Gene-environment interactions", "Meta-analysis", "Methodology", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Depressive Disorder", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Humans", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030991225", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57185822100": {"Name": "Bleys D.", "AuthorID": "57185822100", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Faculty of Brain Sciences"}, "56207422000": {"Name": "Soenens B.", "AuthorID": "56207422000", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology"}, "7004672330": {"Name": "Claes S.", "AuthorID": "7004672330", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, Research Group Psychiatry"}}}
