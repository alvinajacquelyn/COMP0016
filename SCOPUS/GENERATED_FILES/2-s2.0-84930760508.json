In this study we present findings from a two and a half year follow-up of the characteristics associated with ASD in three syndromes: Cornelia de Lange (CdLS), Fragile X (FXS), and Cri du Chat (CdCS). Parents and carers of 251 individuals (CdLS=67, CdCS=42, and FXS=142) completed the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) at Time 1 (T1) and again two and a half years later (T2). The FXS and CdLS groups were more likely to meet the cut-offs for both autism and ASD and show greater severity of ASD related behaviors, at both T1 and T2, compared to the CdCS group. Older individuals (>15yrs) with CdLS were more likely to meet the cut off for ASD than younger individuals (\u226415yrs) with the syndrome and more likely to show greater severity of social impairments. In FXS repetitive behaviors were found to become less prominent with age and in CdCS social impairments were reported to be more severe with age. There were no significant changes between T1 and T2 in the severity of ASD characteristics in the CdCS and CdLS groups. The FXS group showed significantly fewer repetitive behaviors and less severe impairments in social interaction over this time frame. The findings suggest that while there may be similarities in overall severity and presentation of ASD characteristics in CdLS and FXS, these characteristics have divergent patterns of development within these groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Autism spectrum disorder", "Behavioral phenotype", "Cornelia de Lange syndrome", "Cri du Chat syndrome", "Follow-up", "Fragile X syndrome", "Longitudinal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aging", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Communication", "Cri-du-Chat Syndrome", "De Lange Syndrome", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fragile X Syndrome", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930760508", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56646190700": {"Name": "Cochran L.", "AuthorID": "56646190700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, University of Birmingham"}, "57196590272": {"Name": "Nelson L.", "AuthorID": "57196590272", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, University of Birmingham"}, "57203219218": {"Name": "Oliver C.", "AuthorID": "57203219218", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, University of Birmingham"}, "25652154200": {"Name": "Moss J.", "AuthorID": "25652154200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}}}
