Patients treated for a preinvasive or invasive HPV-associated cancer may be at increased risk of a second such malignancy. Methods: We performed a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis to estimate the risk of HPV-associated cancer after prior diagnosis. Studies reporting second cancers at anogenital and oropharyngeal sites after prior diagnoses (preinvasive/invasive HPV-associated cancer) were identified. Studies reporting standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were included in formal meta-analyses of second cancer risk. (PROSPERO ID: CRD42016046974). Results: Searches returned 5599 titles, including 60 unique, eligible studies. Thirty-two (98 comparisons) presented SIRs for second cervical, anal, vulvo-vaginal, penile, and/or oropharyngeal cancers, included in the meta-analyses. All studies (and 95/98 comparisons) reported increased cancers in the population with previous HPV-associated cancer when compared to controls. Pooled SIRs for second primary cancers ranged from 1.75 (95% CI 0.66\u22124.67) for cervical cancer after primary anal cancer, to 13.69 (95% CI 8.56\u221221.89) for anal cancer after primary vulvo-vaginal cancer. Conclusions: We have quantified the increased risk of second HPV-associated cancer following diagnosis and treatment for initial cancer or preinvasive disease. This has important implications for follow-up, screening, and future therapeutic trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anus Neoplasms", "Carcinoma in Situ", "Female", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasms, Second Primary", "Oropharyngeal Neoplasms", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Penile Neoplasms", "Risk Factors", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Vaginal Neoplasms", "Vulvar Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057342653", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"14014363300": {"Name": "Gilbert D.C.", "AuthorID": "14014363300", "AffiliationID": "60012806", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Cancer Centre, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}, "7201699564": {"Name": "Langley R.E.", "AuthorID": "7201699564", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "7005266088": {"Name": "Vale C.L.", "AuthorID": "7005266088", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "35727959100": {"Name": "Wakeham K.", "AuthorID": "35727959100", "AffiliationID": "60012806", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Cancer Centre, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}}}
