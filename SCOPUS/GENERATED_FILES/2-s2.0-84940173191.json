Methods Using data from sexually experienced (\u22651 lifetime sexual partner) 16-year-old to 24-year-old participants in Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (conducted 2010-2012), we explored socio-demographic and behavioural factors associated with prevalent chlamydia infection detected in urine; n=1832), self-reported testing and self-reported diagnosis in the last year (both n=3115). Results Chlamydia prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 2.2% to 4.3%) in women and 2.3% (1.5% to 3.4%) in men. A total of 12.3% of women and 5.3% men had a previous chlamydia diagnosis. Factors associated with prevalent infection were also associated with testing and diagnosis (eg, increasing numbers of sexual partners), with some exceptions. For example, chlamydia prevalence was higher in women living in more deprived areas, whereas testing was not. In men, prevalence was higher in 20-24 than 16-19 year olds but testing was lower. Thirty per cent of women and 53.7% of men with \u22652 new sexual partners in the last year had not recently tested. Conclusions In 2010-2012 in Britain, the proportion of young adults reporting chlamydia testing was generally higher in those reporting factors associated with chlamydia. However, many of those with risk factors had not been recently tested, leaving potential for undiagnosed infections. Greater screening and prevention efforts among individuals in deprived areas and those reporting risk factors for chlamydia may reduce undiagnosed prevalence and transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Attitude", "Bacteriuria", "Chlamydia Infections", "Cluster Analysis", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Life Style", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Sociological Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940173191", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"24391750300": {"Name": "Woodhall S.C.", "AuthorID": "24391750300", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen Social Research"}, "24069384200": {"Name": "Tanton C.", "AuthorID": "24069384200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7003490365": {"Name": "Copas A.J.", "AuthorID": "7003490365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55617668400": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "55617668400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "6701456519": {"Name": "Soldan K.", "AuthorID": "6701456519", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "55519966300": {"Name": "Saunders P.", "AuthorID": "55519966300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Services, Public Health England"}, "37003576900": {"Name": "Da Silva F.", "AuthorID": "37003576900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Services, Public Health England"}, "8668568000": {"Name": "Alexander S.", "AuthorID": "8668568000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Services, Public Health England"}, "35592025300": {"Name": "Ison C.A.", "AuthorID": "35592025300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Services, Public Health England"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
