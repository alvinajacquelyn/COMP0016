However, there is no national CF for pharmacists in Japan yet. Objective: This study was conducted to measure the level of relevance of behavioural statements of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Global Competency Framework (GbCF) to Japanese foundation-level pharmacy practice, aiming for developing a national framework for foundation-level pharmacists in Japan. Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymous, online self-completed survey was conducted during June and July 2018 in Japan. The questionnaire was adopted from the GbCF, translated into Japanese. A snowballing sampling approach was used. The relevance levels of the GbCF items were assessed by using 4-point Likert scales, and analysed by descriptive and inferential methods. Results: A total 604 useable responses were included in analyses. High levels of relevance levels were found in two clusters (\u2018pharmaceutical public health\u2019 and \u2018pharmaceutical care\u2019), while the other two clusters (\u2018organisation and management\u2019 and \u2018professional/personal\u2019) showed significantly low relevance (relevance = 89.6%, 82.5%, 59.6%, and 67.9%, respectively). The study found little engagement of the academic sector with framework, while the industry sector showed relevance to all clusters evenly. Regarding years working in sectors, there was no progression of relevance in \u2018organisation and management\u2019 and \u2018professional/personal\u2019 competencies during foundation years as well as very little professional/personal development. Conclusions: The study revealed specific competencies and behaviours which require modifications to adapt the GbCF into the Japanese pharmacy practice environment. This is a key step towards the development of a national framework, illustrating current Japanese foundation-level pharmacy practice compared with global standards. The findings will be used as a base for developing a framework for foundation-level pharmacists in Japan and address concerns such as pharmacist preparedness to advance in management roles and limited personal and professional development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competency framework", "Continuing professional development", "CPD", "FIP", "GbCF", "Pharmacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068891603", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57216049268": {"Name": "Arakawa N.", "AuthorID": "57216049268", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham, School of Pharmacy, University Park"}, "7202609086": {"Name": "Yamamura S.", "AuthorID": "7202609086", "AffiliationID": "60000023", "AffiliationName": "Josai International University, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences"}, "7101812153": {"Name": "Duggan C.", "AuthorID": "7101812153", "AffiliationID": "100400855", "AffiliationName": "International Pharmaceutical Federation"}, "7006628298": {"Name": "Bates I.", "AuthorID": "7006628298", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}}}
