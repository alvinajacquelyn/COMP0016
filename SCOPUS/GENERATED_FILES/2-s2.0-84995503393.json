Associated factors remain unclear given the importance of the phenomenon to cure research. Methods: Using CASCADE data of seroconverters starting ART in PHI (\u22646 months from seroconversion), we estimated proportions experiencing viral blips (>400 copies followed by <400 copies HIVRNA/ mL without alteration of regimen) while on ART. We used Cox models to examine the association between time from ART stop to loss of control (2 consecutive measurements >1000 copies per milliliter) and magnitude and frequency of blips while on ART, time from seroconversion to ART, time on ART, adjusting for mean number of HIV-RNA measurements/year while on ART, and other confounders. Results: Seven hundred seventy-eight seroconverters started ART in PHI with \u22653 HIV-RNA measurements. Median interquartile range (IQR) ART duration was 16.2 (8.0-35.9) months, within which we observed 13% with \u22651 blip. Of 228 who stopped ART, 119 rebounded; time to loss of control was associated with longer interval between seroconversion and ART initiation [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16 per month; 1.04, 1.28], and blips while on ART (HR = 1.71 per blip; 95% confidence interval = 0.94 to 3.10). Longer time on ART (HR = 0.84 per additional month; 0.76, 0.92) was associated with lower risk of losing control. Of 228 stopping ART, 22 (10%) maintained post treatment control (PTC), ie, HIV-RNA <50 copies per milliliter \u226524 months after ART cessation. Conclusion: HIV viral blips on therapy are associated with subsequent viral rebound on stopping ART among individuals treated in PHI. Longer duration on ART is associated with a greater chance of PTC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cure", "Post treatment control (PTC)", "Primary HIV infection", "Viral blips"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Viral Load", "Withholding Treatment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995503393", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57201568964": {"Name": "Fidler S.", "AuthorID": "57201568964", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Wright Fleming Institute, Department of GUM and Communicable Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, St Mary's Hospital"}, "56135122100": {"Name": "Thornhill J.", "AuthorID": "56135122100", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Wright Fleming Institute, Department of GUM and Communicable Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, St Mary's Hospital"}, "55886472300": {"Name": "Olson A.D.", "AuthorID": "55886472300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7202104963": {"Name": "Porter K.", "AuthorID": "7202104963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35309243900": {"Name": "Bucher H.C.", "AuthorID": "35309243900", "AffiliationID": "60016101, 60028287", "AffiliationName": "Basel Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University Hospital Basel"}, "35581226900": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "35581226900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guys and St Thomas Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7201897940": {"Name": "Morrison C.", "AuthorID": "7201897940", "AffiliationID": "60120612", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Epidemiological Sciences, FHI 360"}, "57216427689": {"Name": "Muga R.", "AuthorID": "57216427689", "AffiliationID": "60028462", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"}, "35573097200": {"Name": "Frater J.", "AuthorID": "35573097200", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
