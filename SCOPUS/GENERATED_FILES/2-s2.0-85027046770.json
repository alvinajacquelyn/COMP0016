Our data highlights the key distinctive physical strategies used by children when performing collaborative tasks during this study. Children in India employ dynamic positioning with frequent physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in the UK tend to prefer static positioning with minimal physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in Finland use a mixture of dynamic and static positioning with minimal physical contact and object movement. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding collaboration strategies and behaviours when designing and deploying interactive tabletops in heterogeneous educational environments. We conclude with a discussion on how designers of tabletops for schools can provide opportunities for children in different countries to define and shape their own collaboration strategies for small group learning that take into account their different classroom practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative learning", "Cross-cultural", "Interaction design", "Interactive tables", "Qualitative", "Quantitative", "User study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collaborative learning", "Cross-cultural", "Interaction design", "Interactive tables", "Qualitative", "Quantitative", "User study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027046770", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"39361715600": {"Name": "Jamil I.", "AuthorID": "39361715600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Merchant Ventures Building, University of Bristol"}, "15726175800": {"Name": "Montero C.", "AuthorID": "15726175800", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland"}, "56250379300": {"Name": "Perry M.", "AuthorID": "56250379300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University"}, "7101930949": {"Name": "O'Hara K.", "AuthorID": "7101930949", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "39061631400": {"Name": "Karnik A.", "AuthorID": "39061631400", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communication, Lancaster University"}, "57192819777": {"Name": "Pihlainen K.", "AuthorID": "57192819777", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "School of Educational Sciences and Psychology, University of Eastern Finland"}, "36624120600": {"Name": "Marshall M.", "AuthorID": "36624120600", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Sheffield Hallam University"}, "55321972300": {"Name": "Jha S.", "AuthorID": "55321972300", "AffiliationID": "114238804", "AffiliationName": "NIIT"}, "55584796603": {"Name": "Gupta S.", "AuthorID": "55584796603", "AffiliationID": "114238804", "AffiliationName": "NIIT"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Sussex"}}}
