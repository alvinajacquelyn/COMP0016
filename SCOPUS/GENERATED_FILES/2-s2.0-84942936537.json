However, cognitive impairment is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, leading to substantial loss to clinic follow-up. In the absence of previous population-based data, we determined the effect of such attrition on measured risk of dementia after transient ischemic attack and stroke. Methods-Patients with transient ischemic attack or stroke prospectively recruited (2002-2007) into the Oxford Vascular (OXVASC) study had baseline clinical/cognitive assessment and follow-up to 2014. Dementia was diagnosed through face-to-face clinic interview, supplemented by home visits and telephone assessment in patients unable to attend clinic and by hand-searching of primary care records in uncontactable patients. Results-Of 1236 patients (mean age/SD, 75.2/12.1 years; 582 men), 527 (43%) died by 5-year follow-up. Follow-up assessment rates (study clinic, home visit, or telephone) of survivors were 947 in 1026 (92%), 857 in 958 (89%), 792 in 915 (87%), and 567 in 673 (84%) at 1, 6, 12 months and 5 years. Dementia developed in 260 patients, of whom 110 (42%; n=50 primary care records, n=49 home visit, and n=11 telephone follow-up) had not been available for face-to-face clinic follow-up at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year cumulative incidence of postevent dementia was 29% (26%-32%) overall but was only 17% (14% to 19%) in clinic assessed versus 45% (39%-51%) in nonclinic-assessed patients (P difference<0.001). Conclusions-Exclusion of patients unavailable for clinic follow-up reduces the measured risk of postevent dementia. Use of multiple follow-up methods, including home visits, telephone assessments, and consent, to access primary care records substantially increases ascertainment of longer-term dementia outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bias (epidemiology)", "dementia", "ischemic attack, transient", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Ischemia", "Cognition", "Dementia", "England", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Stroke", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942936537", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"7004023032": {"Name": "Pendlebury S.T.", "AuthorID": "7004023032", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "55124160100": {"Name": "Chen P.J.", "AuthorID": "55124160100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "22836919400": {"Name": "Welch S.J.V.", "AuthorID": "22836919400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "22834303600": {"Name": "Cuthbertson F.C.", "AuthorID": "22834303600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "56131719000": {"Name": "Wharton R.M.", "AuthorID": "56131719000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "6701728857": {"Name": "Mehta Z.", "AuthorID": "6701728857", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "35417561900": {"Name": "Rothwell P.M.", "AuthorID": "35417561900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}}}
