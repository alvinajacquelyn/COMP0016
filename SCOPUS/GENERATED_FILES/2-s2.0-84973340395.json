The signals are assumed sparse, with unknown support, and evolve over time according to a generic nonlinear dynamical model. Our algorithm, based on recent theoretical results for \u21131-\u21131 minimization, is recursive and computes the number of measurements to be taken at each time on-the-fly. As an example, we apply the algorithm to online compressive video foreground extraction, a problem stated as follows: given a set of measurements of a sequence of images with a static background, simultaneously reconstruct each image while separating its foreground from the background. The performance of our method is illustrated on sequences of real images. We observe that it allows a dramatic reduction in the number of measurements or reconstruction error with respect to state-of-the-art compressive background subtraction schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1 minimization", "background subtraction", "compressive video", "motion estimation", "sparsity", "State estimation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Background subtraction", "compressive video", "Foreground extraction", "Linear measurements", "Nonlinear dynamical models", "Reconstruction error", "sparsity", "Time varying signal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973340395", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"49061361500": {"Name": "Mota J.", "AuthorID": "49061361500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14026659500": {"Name": "Deligiannis N.", "AuthorID": "14026659500", "AffiliationID": "113603225", "AffiliationName": "IMinds"}, "7202521476": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "7202521476", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14523223000": {"Name": "Sankaranarayanan A.", "AuthorID": "14523223000", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "6506127004": {"Name": "Cevher V.", "AuthorID": "6506127004", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems (LIONS), EPFL"}}}
