Specifically, the optical link consists of a single-mode silicon-on-insulator strip waveguide followed by a direct-detection optical receiver containing an optical filter, an ideal square-law photodetector, and an electrical filter. We assume that the optical input consists of a superposition of a nonreturn-to-zero ON-OFF keying modulated optical signal and an additive white Gaussian noise, the BER of the transmitted optical signal being calculated using the time domain Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion method. The propagation of the optical signal in the Si-PhW is described by employing both a rigorous theoretical model that incorporates all relevant linear and nonlinear optical effects and the mutual interaction between the free carriers and the optical field, as well as a linearized model valid in the low-noise power regime. These analytical and computational tools are then used to comprehensively investigate the influence of the parameters characterizing the waveguide and optical signal on the transmission BER.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BER evaluation", "direct-detection receiver", "Silicon photonic wires"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additive White Gaussian noise", "BER evaluation", "Direct detection receivers", "Nonlinear optical effects", "Parameters characterizing", "Silicon photonic wires", "Theoretical approach", "Theoretical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923261422", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
