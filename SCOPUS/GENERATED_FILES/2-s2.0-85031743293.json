The move towards opening access to learning courses provides learners with the possibility to bring together learning opportunities from diverse sites. However, there is a danger in narrowly viewing learning as the acquisition of resources. This view restricts benefits of open resources to experienced, self-regulated learners. This chapter analyses diverse pedagogies that enable learners to capitalise on digital, open resources. It calls for a fundamental rethink of our cultural view of learning and teaching, focusing attention on how we encourage learners to create and navigate their own pathways, placing the self-regulation of learning as the norm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MOOCs", "OER", "Open courses", "Open educational practice", "Open educational resources", "Open pedagogy", "Open resources"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031743293", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7005935975": {"Name": "Littlejohn A.", "AuthorID": "7005935975", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}, "14018485100": {"Name": "McGill L.", "AuthorID": "14018485100", "AffiliationID": "119642684", "AffiliationName": "Lou McGill Consultancy Ltd."}}}
