We applied a quantitative and qualitative survey to a sample of 528 students studying in teachers\u2019 preparation programmes in three higher education institutions: one research university with a large Jewish majority and only Jewish respondents to our survey, one Palestinian-Arab college and one Jewish secular college. In both Jewish and Arab sectors, we found a major gap between teachers\u2019 perceived desired curriculum and the official (nationalistic) one. The results indicated that the university students, who come from higher socio-economic backgrounds, prefer significantly more internationally oriented curricula than Palestinian-Arab students and Jewish students in colleges. In addition, students who are studying in the university were found to attribute more importance than all college students to globally oriented curricular content for their pupils\u2019 future success. Notably the Jewish students choose to include more globally oriented subjects than are currently found in the official curriculum. On other measures, there was less difference between Jewish and Palestinian-Arab students. The qualitative phase of our research revealed that this seeming anomaly is due to the relative lack of sector-specific content in the formal curriculum covering the history of Palestinian-Arab population. This study yields important implications for history curricular design in the context of the global-local nexus, particularly within conflict-ridden societies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["global\u2013local mix", "internationalization", "Israel", "teachers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920108802", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}, "56394484700": {"Name": "Yardeni-Kuperberg O.", "AuthorID": "56394484700", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}, "56347376600": {"Name": "Natur N.", "AuthorID": "56347376600", "AffiliationID": "112118346", "AffiliationName": "Al-Qasemi Academic College"}}}
