We interviewed 20 Western Muslim young adults born in Montreal, Berlin, and Copenhagen within the age range of 18\u201325, exploring their religious identity development. The interviews were semi-structured and open-ended. Thematic content analysis was used to explore patterns in their narratives. The participants disliked the perceived ethnocentric Muslim identity of their parents, which they sought to \u2018purify\u2019 for themselves from \u2018cultural contamination\u2019. There were two important elements underlying the process of religious identity objectification: experience of anti-Muslim political discourse and exposure to religious diversity in the aftermath of deterritorialisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["identity development", "Islamophobia", "objectification", "religious identity", "Western Muslims"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064913748", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"56638705300": {"Name": "Younis T.", "AuthorID": "56638705300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24728985700": {"Name": "Hassan G.", "AuthorID": "24728985700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
