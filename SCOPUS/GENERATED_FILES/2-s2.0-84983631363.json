For a geometric Brownian motion, the problem is solved through the so-called Kelly criterion, according to which the optimal growth rate is achieved by investing a constant given fraction of resources at any step of the dynamics. We generalize these finding to the case of dynamical equations with finite carrying capacity, which can find applications in biology, mathematical ecology, and finance. We formulate the problem in terms of a stochastic process with multiplicative noise and a nonlinear drift term that is determined by the specific functional form of carrying capacity. We solve the stochastic equation for two classes of carrying capacity functions (power laws and logarithmic), and in both cases we compute the optimal trajectories of the control parameter. We further test the validity of our analytical results using numerical simulations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Average growth rate", "Control parameters", "Finding optimal strategies", "Geometric Brownian motion", "Mathematical ecology", "Multiplicative noise", "Optimal trajectories", "Stochastic equations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983631363", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36157854300": {"Name": "Caravelli F.", "AuthorID": "36157854300", "AffiliationID": "113146644", "AffiliationName": "London Institute of Mathematical Sciences"}, "22036198600": {"Name": "Sindoni L.", "AuthorID": "22036198600", "AffiliationID": "116607609", "AffiliationName": "Invenia Labs"}, "35390328800": {"Name": "Ududec C.", "AuthorID": "35390328800", "AffiliationID": "116607609", "AffiliationName": "Invenia Labs"}, "24775109100": {"Name": "Caccioli F.", "AuthorID": "24775109100", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}}}
