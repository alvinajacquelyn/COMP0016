Imaging hardware providing basic imaging sequences as well as advanced MRI can be seamlessly integrated into routine surgical environments, which continuously leads to emerging indications for iMRI-assisted surgery. Besides the obvious intraoperative diagnostic yield, the initial clinical benefits have to be confirmed by future-controlled long-term studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain tumors", "Deep brain stimulation", "Epilepsy", "Intraoperative MRI", "Skull base"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Diseases", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Monitoring, Intraoperative", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942550956", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Eberhard Karls University Hospital"}, "6604057209": {"Name": "Ernemann U.", "AuthorID": "6604057209", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Eberhard Karls University Hospital"}, "36106449500": {"Name": "Roder C.", "AuthorID": "36106449500", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Eberhard Karls University Hospital"}, "55263777100": {"Name": "Tatagiba M.", "AuthorID": "55263777100", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Eberhard Karls University Hospital"}}}
