Through the IPD project we have established a central platform for the curation and publication of locusspecific databases involved either directly or related to the function of the Major Histocompatibility Complex in a number of different species.We have collaborated with specialist groups or nomenclature committees that curate the individual sections before they are submitted to IPD for online publication. IPD consists of five core databases, with the IMGT/HLA Database as the primary database. Through the work of the various nomenclature committees, the HLA Informatics Group and in collaboration with the European Bioinformatics Institute we are able to provide public access to this data through the website http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/. The IPD project continues to develop with new tools being added to address scientific developments, such as Next Generation Sequencing, and to address user feedback and requests. Regular updates to the website ensure that new and confirmatory sequences are dispersed to the immunogenetics community, and the wider research and clinical communities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Antigens, Human Platelet", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Databases, Genetic", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Internet", "Major Histocompatibility Complex", "Models, Genetic", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Receptors, KIR", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941057685", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55690121900": {"Name": "Robinson J.", "AuthorID": "55690121900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55633554500": {"Name": "Halliwell J.", "AuthorID": "55633554500", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "56511924900": {"Name": "Hayhurst J.", "AuthorID": "56511924900", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "16506662800": {"Name": "Flicek P.", "AuthorID": "16506662800", "AffiliationID": "60026124, 60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "35392381800": {"Name": "Parham P.", "AuthorID": "35392381800", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University, School of Medicine"}}}
