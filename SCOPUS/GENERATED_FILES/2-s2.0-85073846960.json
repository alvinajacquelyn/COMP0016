It focuses on initial meetings, outlining steps with the older person and creating the sorts of therapeutic relationships where people feel heard and able to talk openly. The chapter explains that older people hear the words they have used fed back or summarized to them, they feel heard and understood. Hearing their own words also makes them reassess and sometimes change what they originally said. In this way, they are taking an observer perspective to themselves and are able to reflect on and evaluate their own perhaps previously taken for granted talk. The chapter also adopts a stance of \u201ccuriosity\u201d to develop conversations, holding the view that there is not one explanation for clients\u2019 situations, but, rather, that there are a multiplicity of possible explanations and understandings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073846960", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36441678800": {"Name": "Stott J.", "AuthorID": "36441678800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211421968": {"Name": "Martin E.", "AuthorID": "57211421968", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
