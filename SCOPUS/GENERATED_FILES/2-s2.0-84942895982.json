This study sought to explore reasons for low uptake of CRC screening in South Asian communities and for the variability of low uptake between three faith communities; and to identify strategies by which uptake might be improved. Methods: We interviewed 16 'key informants' representing communities from the three largest South Asian faith backgrounds (Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism) in London, England. Results: Reasons for low colorectal cancer screening uptake were overwhelmingly shared across South Asian faith groups. These were: limitations posed by written English; limitations posed by any written language; reliance on younger family members; low awareness of colorectal cancer and screening; and difficulties associated with faeces. Non-written information delivered verbally and interactively within faith or community settings was preferred across faith communities. Conclusions: Efforts to increase accessibility to colorectal cancer screening in South Asian communities should use local language broadcasts on ethnic media and face-to-face approaches within community and faith settings to increase awareness of colorectal cancer and screening, and address challenges posed by written materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Access", "Bowel cancer screening", "Colorectal cancer screening", "Guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBt)", "Health services", "Key informant", "Minority ethnic groups", "Qualitative", "South Asian", "Uptake"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asia", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "Hinduism", "Humans", "Islam", "London", "Mass Screening", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Religion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942895982", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"20135519300": {"Name": "Palmer C.", "AuthorID": "20135519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57206961221": {"Name": "Thomas M.", "AuthorID": "57206961221", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "44361787800": {"Name": "McGregor L.", "AuthorID": "44361787800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "Von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}}}
