Extant research on city government participation in global governance networks, or \u201ctransnational municipal networks (TMNs)\u201d such as United Cities Local Governments, has largely ignored the relevance of research showing city-level connectivity to corporate and other economic networks among world cities. In this latter tradition of research, the level of a city\u2019s connectivity to such economic networks is understood as commensurate with the hierarchical power it holds in the global economy. Using a sample of UK and Chinese cities, this study shows that patterns of participation in a range of TMNs are explained by varied measures of city-level connectivity to economic networks. Interpreted through structuration theory, findings suggest that city participation in global governance is shaped and stratified by city-level hierarchical power within the global economy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041626530", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"57200536984": {"Name": "Leffel B.", "AuthorID": "57200536984", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "University of California Irvine (UCI)"}, "26021005000": {"Name": "Acuto M.", "AuthorID": "26021005000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}}}
