Our analysis considers use traces from 307 users that include over 2.8 million notifications and 800, 000 screen usage events, and we compare our findings to previous work that quantifies smartphone use. The results show that smartwatches are used more briefly and more frequently throughout the day, with half the sessions lasting less than 5 seconds. Interaction with notifications is similar across both types of devices, both in terms of response times and preferred application types. We also analyse the differences between our smartwatch dataset and a dataset aggregated from four previously conducted smartphone studies. The similarities and differences between smartwatch and smartphone use suggest effect on usage that go beyond differences in form factor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Applications", "Interactions", "Session", "Smartphones", "Smartwatches", "Usage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Form factors", "Session", "Smartwatches", "Usage"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030326388", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57191504210": {"Name": "Visuri A.", "AuthorID": "57191504210", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ubiquitous Computing, University of Oulu"}, "57189710789": {"Name": "Sarsenbayeva Z.", "AuthorID": "57189710789", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne"}, "56032304300": {"Name": "Van Berkel N.", "AuthorID": "56032304300", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne"}, "7103326186": {"Name": "Goncalves J.", "AuthorID": "7103326186", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne"}, "6508135447": {"Name": "Kostakos V.", "AuthorID": "6508135447", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne"}, "39961368900": {"Name": "Ferreira D.", "AuthorID": "39961368900", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ubiquitous Computing, University of Oulu"}, "36634807900": {"Name": "Rawassizadeh R.", "AuthorID": "36634807900", "AffiliationID": "60010756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College"}}}
