Methods: This retrospective, pilot-study approved by the IRB comprised 45 lymphoma patients undergoing routine 18F-FDG-PET-CT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined from clinical follow-up (mean-duration: 40 months; range: 10-62 months). Non-contrast-enhanced low-dose CT images were submitted to CTTA comprising image filtration to highlight features of different sizes followed by histogram-analysis using kurtosis. Prognostic value of CTTA was compared to PET FDG-uptake value, tumour-stage, tumour-bulk, lymphoma-type, treatment-regime, and interim FDG-PET (iPET) status using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox regression analysis determined the independence of significantly prognostic imaging and clinical features. Results: A total of 27 patients had aggressive NHL and 18 had HL. Mean PFS was 48.5 months. There was no significant difference in pre-treatment CTTA between the lymphoma sub-types. Kaplan-Meier analysis found pre-treatment CTTA (medium feature scale, p=0.010) and iPET status (p<0.001) to be significant predictors of PFS. Cox analysis revealed that an interaction between pre-treatment CTTA and iPET status was the only independent predictor of PFS (HR: 25.5, 95% CI: 5.4-120, p<0.001). Specifically, pre-treatment CTTA risk stratified patients with negative iPET. Conclusion: CTTA can potentially provide prognostic information complementary to iPET for patients with HL and aggressive NHL. Key Points: \u2022 CT texture-analysis (CTTA) provides prognostic information complementary to interim FDG-PET in Lymphoma. \u2022 Pre-treatment CTTA and interim PET status were significant predictors of progression-free survival. \u2022 Patients with negative interim PET could be further stratified by pre-treatment CTTA. \u2022 Provide precision surveillance where additional imaging reserved for patients at greatest recurrence-risk. \u2022 Assists in risk-adapted treatment strategy based on interim PET and CTTA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lymphoma", "Positron emission tomography and Computed tomography", "Progression-free survival", "Risk stratification", "Texture analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Hodgkin Disease", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prognosis", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977100578", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "16948025200": {"Name": "Miles K.A.", "AuthorID": "16948025200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "56004642300": {"Name": "Shortman R.", "AuthorID": "56004642300", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "38662206500": {"Name": "Afaq A.", "AuthorID": "38662206500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "6603239253": {"Name": "Ardeshna K.M.", "AuthorID": "6603239253", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "8960246500": {"Name": "Kayani I.", "AuthorID": "8960246500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57190064109": {"Name": "Babikir S.", "AuthorID": "57190064109", "AffiliationID": "60019311", "AffiliationName": "Human Health Division, Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging Section, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"}}}
