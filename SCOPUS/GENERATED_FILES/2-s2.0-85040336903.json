This allows us to characterize the coherent charge-qubit dynamics in the strong-driving regime. The device is realized within a silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistor. We first read out the charge state of the system in a continuous nondemolition manner by measuring the dispersive response of a high-frequency electrical resonator coupled to the quantum system via the gate. By performing multiple fast passages around the qubit avoided crossing, we observe a multipassage LZSM interferometry pattern. At larger driving amplitudes, a projective measurement to an even-parity charge state is realized, showing a strong enhancement of the dispersive readout signal. At even larger driving amplitudes, two projective measurements are realized within the coherent evolution resulting in the disappearance of the interference pattern. Our results demonstrate a way to increase the state readout signal of coherent quantum systems and replicate single-electron analogs of optical interferometry within a CMOS transistor.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Avoided crossings", "Complementary metal oxide semiconductors", "Electrical resonators", "High frequency HF", "Interference patterns", "Optical interferometry", "Projective measurement", "Strong enhancement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040336903", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56939762900": {"Name": "Chatterjee A.", "AuthorID": "56939762900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7101791730": {"Name": "Shevchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "7101791730", "AffiliationID": "60027251", "AffiliationName": "V.
