Objectives: The primary and secondary objectives were to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and maintenance of efficacy of bapineuzumab. Methods: A multicenter study in patients who had participated in double-blind placebo-controlled parent studies. Patients enrolled in the extension study were assigned to receive IV infusions of bapineuzumab (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) every 13 weeks until termination but were blinded to whether they had received bapineuzumab or placebo in the parent studies. Results: A total of 1,462 (688 were APOE \u03c34 carriers and 774 were noncarriers) patients were enrolled. Extension-onset adverse events occurred in >81% of the patients in each dose group. Fall, urinary tract infection, agitation, and ARIA-E occurred in \u226510% of participants. The incidence proportion of ARIA-E was higher among carriers and noncarriers who received bapineuzumab for the first time in the extension study (11.8% and 5.4%, respectively) versus those who were previously exposed in the parent studies (5.1% and 1.3%, respectively). After 6 to 12 months exposure to bapineuzumab IV in the extension study, similar deterioration of cognition and function occurred with no significant differences between the dose groups. Conclusions: Infusion of bapineuzumab 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg every 13 weeks for up to 3 years was generally well tolerated, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to that in previous studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-related imaging abnormality with edema/effusions", "Bapineuzumab", "Long-term safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Apolipoproteins E", "Brain", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Retrospective Studies", "tau Proteins", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049674602", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003840992": {"Name": "Salloway S.P.", "AuthorID": "7003840992", "AffiliationID": "60003486, 60009796", "AffiliationName": "Brown Medical School, Butler Hospital"}, "7101961665": {"Name": "Sperling R.", "AuthorID": "7101961665", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "35380609700": {"Name": "Sabbagh M.N.", "AuthorID": "35380609700", "AffiliationID": "112771419", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health"}, "56954714300": {"Name": "Honig L.S.", "AuthorID": "56954714300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "6603579985": {"Name": "Porsteinsson A.P.", "AuthorID": "6603579985", "AffiliationID": "60012831, 60027165", "AffiliationName": "University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57202335036": {"Name": "Rofael H.", "AuthorID": "57202335036", "AffiliationID": "112587494", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development, LLC"}, "57194486125": {"Name": "Ketter N.", "AuthorID": "57194486125", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56009596900": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "56009596900", "AffiliationID": "112587494", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development, LLC"}, "35409677100": {"Name": "Liu E.", "AuthorID": "35409677100", "AffiliationID": "60162103", "AffiliationName": "Prothena Biosciences Inc."}, "57202891230": {"Name": "Carr S.", "AuthorID": "57202891230", "AffiliationID": "112587494", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development, LLC"}, "7402324551": {"Name": "Black R.S.", "AuthorID": "7402324551", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55880140400": {"Name": "Brashear H.R.", "AuthorID": "55880140400", "AffiliationID": "60027736", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research and Development LLC"}}}
