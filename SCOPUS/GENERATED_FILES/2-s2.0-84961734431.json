Trivalent antimony - with a distinctive 5s2 electronic configuration - can be combined with a chalcogen (e.g., S or Se) and halide (e.g., Br or I) to produce photoactive ferroelectric semiconductors with similarities to the Pb halide perovskites. We report - from relativistic quasi-particle self-consistent GW theory - that these materials have a multi-valley electronic structure with several electron and hole basins close to the band extrema. We predict ionisation potentials of 5.3-5.8 eV from first-principles for the three materials, and assess electrical contacts that will be suitable for achieving photovoltaic action from these unconventional compounds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical contacts", "Electronic band structure", "Electronic configuration", "Ferroelectric semiconductors", "First principles", "Halide perovskites", "Photovoltaic", "Quasi particles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961734431", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55423351000": {"Name": "Butler K.", "AuthorID": "55423351000", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "Global E3 Institute and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University"}, "55793285800": {"Name": "McKechnie S.", "AuthorID": "55793285800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kings College London"}, "56641895300": {"Name": "Azarhoosh P.", "AuthorID": "56641895300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kings College London"}, "7003420136": {"Name": "Van Schilfgaarde M.", "AuthorID": "7003420136", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kings College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
