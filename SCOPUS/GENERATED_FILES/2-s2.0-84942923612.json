However, the influence on the quality of life of affected patients is still unclear. Objective: To evaluate the impact of OM on the oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of patients diagnosed with cancer, who developed chemotherapy- and/or radiotherapy-induced OM. Methods: This is a cross-sectional evaluation of QoL using oral health impact profile-14 (OHIP-14). The study group comprised a sample of 60 patients diagnosed with cancer, who developed OM during the treatment. The instrument (OHIP-14) composed of seven dimensions was used: functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical deficiency, psychological deficiency, social incapacity, and deficiency. Results: The internal consistency of OHIP-14 measured by the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was of 0.76. Physical pain attained the highest score (worst quality of life) among the studied dimensions 60.8% (292/480), followed by physical limitation 52.7% (253/480), and psychological discomfort 50.8% (244/480). The dimension 'social limitation' obtained the lowest score 27.2% (131/480). There was statistically significant difference as regards gender (P = 0.021) for physical pain, with greater impact among patients of the male gender. Conclusion: Oral-health-related quality of life is significantly affected by OM in individuals diagnosed with cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Mucositis", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasms", "Oral Health", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Quality of Life", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Stomatitis", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942923612", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"26631768500": {"Name": "Barkokebas A.", "AuthorID": "26631768500", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "36627770400": {"Name": "Silva I.", "AuthorID": "36627770400", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "56754796300": {"Name": "de Andrade S.", "AuthorID": "56754796300", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "55430746800": {"Name": "Carvalho A.", "AuthorID": "55430746800", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinic and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "24468212200": {"Name": "Gueiros L.", "AuthorID": "24468212200", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinic and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinic and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "12770103300": {"Name": "Paiva S.", "AuthorID": "12770103300", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics, Federal University of Minas Gerais"}}}
