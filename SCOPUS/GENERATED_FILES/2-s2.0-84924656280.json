The tumors morphologically resemble embryonic kidneys with a disrupted architecture and are associated with undifferentiated metanephric precursors. Here, we discuss genetic and epigenetic findings in Wilms\u2019 tumor in the context of renal development. Many of the genes implicated in Wilms\u2019 tumorigenesis are involved in the control of nephron progenitors or the microRNA (miRNA) processing pathway. Whereas the first group of genes has been extensively studied in normal development, the second finding suggests important roles for miRNAs in general\u2014and specific miRNAs in particular\u2014in normal kidney development that still await further analysis. The recent identification of Wilms\u2019 tumor cancer stem cells could provide a framework to integrate these pathways and translate them into new or improved therapeutic interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Kidney development", "miRNA", "Nephron progenitor cells", "Wilms\u2019 tumor", "Wt1", "\u03b2-catenin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Neoplasms", "MicroRNAs", "Organogenesis", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924656280", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"6602390902": {"Name": "Hohenstein P.", "AuthorID": "6602390902", "AffiliationID": "60012914, 60027272, 60013999", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Genetics Unit, MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56146245100": {"Name": "Charlton J.", "AuthorID": "56146245100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
