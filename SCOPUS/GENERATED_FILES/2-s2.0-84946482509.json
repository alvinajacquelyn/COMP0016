This paper describes the design and validation of a classifier of upper-limb analytical movements based on electroencephalographic activity extracted from intervals preceding self-initiated movement tasks. Features selected for the classification are subject specific and associated with the movement tasks. Further tests are performed to reject the hypothesis that other information different from the task-related cortical activity is being used by the classifiers. Six healthy subjects were measured performing self-initiated upper-limb analytical movements. A Bayesian classifier was used to classify among seven different kinds of movements. Features considered covered the alpha and beta bands. A genetic algorithm was used to optimally select a subset of features for the classification. An average accuracy of 62.9 \u00b1 7.5 % was reached, which was above the baseline level observed with the proposed methodology (30.2 \u00b1 4.3 %). The study shows how the electroencephalography carries information about the type of analytical movement performed with the upper limb and how it can be decoded before the movement begins. In neurorehabilitation environments, this information could be used for monitoring and assisting purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain\u2013computer interface", "Data mining", "Electroencephalography", "Genetic algorithms", "Voluntary movements"], "IndexKeywords": ["Baseline levels", "Bayesian classifier", "Cortical activity", "Healthy subjects", "Neurorehabilitation", "Subject-specific", "Upper limbs", "Voluntary movement", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Male", "Reproducibility of Results", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Upper Extremity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946482509", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57212057392": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez J.", "AuthorID": "57212057392", "AffiliationID": "60022146, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute, Spanish National Research Council - CSIC"}, "7202123192": {"Name": "Pons J.L.", "AuthorID": "7202123192", "AffiliationID": "60022146, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute, Spanish National Research Council - CSIC"}, "8837740500": {"Name": "Serrano J.I.", "AuthorID": "8837740500", "AffiliationID": "60006754, 60103740", "AffiliationName": "Neural and Cognitive Engineering Group, Centro de Autom\u00e1tica y Rob\u00f3tica, Spanish National Research Council - CSIC"}, "57001065500": {"Name": "del Castillo M.D.", "AuthorID": "57001065500", "AffiliationID": "60006754, 60103740", "AffiliationName": "Neural and Cognitive Engineering Group, Centro de Autom\u00e1tica y Rob\u00f3tica, Spanish National Research Council - CSIC"}, "55799673400": {"Name": "Minguez J.", "AuthorID": "55799673400", "AffiliationID": "113360504", "AffiliationName": "BitBrain Technologies"}}}
