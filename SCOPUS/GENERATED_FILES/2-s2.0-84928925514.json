Study Design and Setting We reviewed 300 CRTs published between 2000 and 2008. The prevalence of reporting sample size elements from the 2004 CONSORT recommendations was evaluated and a priori estimates compared with those observed in the trial. Results Of the 300 trials, 166 (55%) reported a sample size calculation. Only 36 of 166 (22%) reported all recommended descriptive elements. Elements specific to CRTs were the worst reported: a measure of within-cluster correlation was specified in only 58 of 166 (35%). Only 18 of 166 articles (11%) reported both a priori and observed within-cluster correlation values. Except in two cases, observed within-cluster correlation values were either close to or less than a priori values. Conclusion Even with the CONSORT extension for cluster randomization, the reporting of sample size elements specific to these trials remains below that necessary for transparent reporting. Journal editors and peer reviewers should implement stricter requirements for authors to follow CONSORT recommendations. Authors should report observed and a priori within-cluster correlation values to enable comparisons between these over a wider range of trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cluster randomized trial", "CONSORT statement", "Intracluster correlation coefficient", "Reporting", "Sample size", "Statistical methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cluster Analysis", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Research Design", "Research Report", "Sample Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928925514", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"35196953100": {"Name": "Rutterford C.", "AuthorID": "35196953100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7004645125": {"Name": "Eldridge S.", "AuthorID": "7004645125", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "13104397100": {"Name": "Taljaard M.", "AuthorID": "13104397100", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "55638127700": {"Name": "Dixon S.", "AuthorID": "55638127700", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Density, University of Western Ontario"}, "7003490365": {"Name": "Copas A.", "AuthorID": "7003490365", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "Hub for Trials Methodology Research, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}}}
