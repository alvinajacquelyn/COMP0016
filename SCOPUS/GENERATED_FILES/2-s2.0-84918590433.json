For such multi-view data, face recognition systems often perform poorly. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a graph embedding framework, which can project the multi-view data into a common subspace of higher discriminability between classes. This framework can be readily utilized to extend classical dimensionality reduction methods to multi-view scenarios. Hence, by utilizing the framework for multi-view face recognition, we propose multi-view linear discriminant analysis (MiLDA). We also empirically demonstrate that, for several distinct multi-view face recognition scenarios, MiLDA has an excellent performance and outperforms many popular approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Face recognition", "Graph embedding", "Multi-view"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dimensionality reduction method", "Discriminability", "Face recognition systems", "Graph embeddings", "Linear discriminant analysis", "Multi-view datum", "Multi-views", "Multiview face recognition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918590433", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57215680918": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "57215680918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7401929138": {"Name": "Ding X.", "AuthorID": "7401929138", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
