Choosing optimal action strategies involves weighting the costs and gains of potential outcomes by their corresponding probabilities, and requires stable representations of one's own imprecisions. How this ability is acquired during development in childhood when visuomotor skills change drastically is unknown. In a rewarded rapid reaching task, 6- to 11-year-old children followed 'risk-seeking' strategies leading to overly high point-loss. Adults' performance, in contrast, was close to optimal. Children's errors were not explained by distorted estimates of value or probability, but may reflect different action selection criteria or immature integration of value and probability information while planning movements. These findings provide a starting point for understanding children's risk-taking in everyday visuomotor situations when suboptimal choices can be dangerous. Moreover, children's risky visuomotor decisions mirror those reported for non-motor gambles, raising the possibility that common processes underlie development across decision-making domains. We tracked the development of visuomotor decision-making during childhood, using a task in which participants rapidly reached towards targets to win points whilst avoiding penalty regions that incurred loss. Adults aimed for locations on the screen (Touched Location) with the highest expected score (Max Gain Location), while children aged 6-11 years aimed too close to the penalty region (data below the dotted identity line), with detrimental effects on their scores. This reveals a clear, age-related shift towards more optimal visuomotor decision-making across childhood and adulthood, with overly risk-seeking action selection between ages 6 and 11 years.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Analysis of Variance", "Child", "Choice Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Movement", "Probability", "Psychomotor Performance", "Risk-Taking", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937231476", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36666127500": {"Name": "Dekker T.", "AuthorID": "36666127500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Visual Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8249732800": {"Name": "Nardini M.", "AuthorID": "8249732800", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Durham University"}}}
