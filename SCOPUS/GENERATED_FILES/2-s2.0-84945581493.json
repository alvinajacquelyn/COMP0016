Methods: PubMed was searched from inception to November 2014 to find articles reporting the prevalence and long-term health outcomes of infantile colic, regurgitation, functional constipation, functional diarrhoea, and dyschezia in infants younger than <12 months. A questionnaire was sent to practising clinicians worldwide, and a group of 15 international experts met to discuss the likely frequency and longer-term consequences of these symptoms. Results: The literature search identified 30 studies reporting the prevalence of infantile colic (2%-73%), 13 that of regurgitation (3%-87%), 8 that of functional constipation (0.05%-39.3%), 2 that of functional diarrhoea (2%-4.1%), and 3 that of dyschezia (0.9%-5.6%). The studies varied in design, populations investigated, and definition of the symptoms. Questionnaires were received from 369 respondents. The experts agreed that the likely prevalences for colic, regurgitation, and functional constipation were 20%, 30%, and 15%, respectively. The limited data in the literature for functional diarrhoea and dyschezia suggest prevalences <10%. Infantile colic may be associated with future health problems in a subset of infants. Conclusions: Functional gastrointestinal symptoms appear to occur in a significant proportion of infants younger than 12 months and may have an impact on future health outcomes. Prospective collection of data according to agreed criteria is needed to obtain more accurate estimates of the prevalence and consequences of these symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constipation", "Dyschezia", "Functional diarrhoea", "Functional gastrointestinal disorder", "Infant", "Infantile colic", "Regurgitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child Health", "Colic", "Constipation", "Diarrhea", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Prevalence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945581493", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57202569212": {"Name": "Vandenplas Y.", "AuthorID": "57202569212", "AffiliationID": "60069985, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, UZ Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "6602644386": {"Name": "Abkari A.", "AuthorID": "6602644386", "AffiliationID": "60019926, 60025457", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Gastroenterology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Faculty of Medicine, University Hassan 2"}, "15818853700": {"Name": "Bellaiche M.", "AuthorID": "15818853700", "AffiliationID": "60011675", "AffiliationName": "GI Unit, Robert Debre Hospital"}, "7003532912": {"Name": "Benninga M.", "AuthorID": "7003532912", "AffiliationID": "60070178, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center"}, "7006456545": {"Name": "Chouraqui J.P.", "AuthorID": "7006456545", "AffiliationID": "113146195", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterol., Hepatologie et Nutr, Clinique Universitaire de Pediatrie"}, "56928319800": {"Name": "\u00c7okuorap F.", "AuthorID": "56928319800", "AffiliationID": "60028502, 60010811", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition, Cerrahpa\u015fa Medical Faculty, University of Istanbul"}, "56928377700": {"Name": "Harb T.", "AuthorID": "56928377700", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Children's Nutrition Research Centre, Queensland Children's Medical Research Institute, University of Queensland"}, "6506273944": {"Name": "Hegar B.", "AuthorID": "6506273944", "AffiliationID": "60069377", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Health University of Indonesia"}, "7003276606": {"Name": "Lifschitz C.", "AuthorID": "7003276606", "AffiliationID": "60008557", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Transplantation, Hospital Italiano"}, "7007149375": {"Name": "Ludwig T.", "AuthorID": "7007149375", "AffiliationID": "60023453", "AffiliationName": "Nutricia Research"}, "26664817800": {"Name": "Miqdady M.", "AuthorID": "26664817800", "AffiliationID": "60070809", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric GI, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Sheikh Khalifa Medical City"}, "7003487583": {"Name": "De Morais M.B.", "AuthorID": "7003487583", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Paulista School of Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "6603411629": {"Name": "Osatakul S.", "AuthorID": "6603411629", "AffiliationID": "60006314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University"}, "55390678300": {"Name": "Salvatore S.", "AuthorID": "55390678300", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Clinica Pediatrica, Universit\u00e0 Dell'Insubria"}, "7005411699": {"Name": "Shamir R.", "AuthorID": "7005411699", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Schneider Children's Medical Centre of Israel, Tel-Aviv University"}, "7005889428": {"Name": "Staiano A.", "AuthorID": "7005889428", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medical Science, Section of Pediatrics, University of Naples Federico II"}, "35494468100": {"Name": "Szajewska H.", "AuthorID": "35494468100", "AffiliationID": "60069009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Warsaw"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
