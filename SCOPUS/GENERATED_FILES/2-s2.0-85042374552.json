Many of these neoplasms affect young children, have a very high mortality and therapeutic strategies are often aggressive with poor long-term outcomes. There is a great need to accurately diagnose embryonal tumours, predict their outcome and adapt therapy to the individual patient's risk. For the first time in 2016, the WHO classification took into account molecular characteristics for the diagnosis of CNS tumours. This integration of histological features with genetic information has significantly changed the diagnostic work-up and reporting of tumours of the CNS. However, this remains challenging in embryonal tumours due to their previously unaccounted tumour heterogeneity. We describe the recent revisions made to the 4th edition of the WHO classification of CNS tumours and review the main changes, while highlighting some of the more common diagnostic testing strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour", "embryonal tumour", "embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes", "medulloblastoma", "World Health Organisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Humans", "Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042374552", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57200759862": {"Name": "Pickles J.C.", "AuthorID": "57200759862", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203196123": {"Name": "Hawkins C.", "AuthorID": "57203196123", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pathology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "51564611100": {"Name": "Pietsch T.", "AuthorID": "51564611100", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Brain Tumor Reference Center of the DGNN, University of Bonn, Medical Center Sigmund-Freud"}}}
