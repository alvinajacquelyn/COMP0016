Data for the study was collected using photo voice technique. Data analysis was conducted using photos and analysis of group transcripts. Participants describe how they tapped into social, physical and digital sites to draw information in the process of (re) forming their information landscapes, building bridges into new communities and maintaining links with family overseas. Media formats were identified according to their appropriateness as fit for purpose, suggesting that the enactment of information literacy was agile and responsive to need at the moment of practice. The results indicate that everyday spaces provide opportunities to develop information literacy practices, which support informal learning. Findings of the study conclude that information literacy is played out in a series of digital, vernacular and visual enactments, which shape the information landscape.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Information literacy", "refugees"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052719599", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"35614004000": {"Name": "Lloyd A.", "AuthorID": "35614004000", "AffiliationID": "60033091", "AffiliationName": "University of Boras"}, "35350629900": {"Name": "Wilkinson J.", "AuthorID": "35350629900", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University"}}}
