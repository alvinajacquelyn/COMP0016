The addition of silicon carbide in the construction of heterogeneous double bubble systems, along with zinc oxide and gallium nitride, yields electronic structures that are favourable for electron-hole separation. The standard formation enthalpies of such systems are comparable with those of fullerenes, suggesting that these systems would be achievable and of direct benefit to photovoltaic and electrochemical applications such as water splitting; with the (SiC)12(ZnO)48 proving to be the most promising building block for future functional composite materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Core-shell nanoparticles", "Electron-hole separation", "Photocatalysis", "Photovoltaics", "Water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Core-shell nanoparticles", "Electrochemical applications", "Electron-hole separation", "Formation enthalpy", "Functional composites", "Photovoltaics", "Secondary building units", "Water splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958981573", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"38361260600": {"Name": "Farrow M.", "AuthorID": "38361260600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005172169": {"Name": "Sokol A.", "AuthorID": "7005172169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003322273": {"Name": "Woodley S.", "AuthorID": "7003322273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, University College London"}}}
