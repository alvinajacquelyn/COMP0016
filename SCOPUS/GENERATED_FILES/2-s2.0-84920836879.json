As many diseases are age-related, older adults represent a highly heterogeneous cohort. This presents a major challenge for both the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare professionals. The purpose of this research was to attract attention towards the appropriateness of geriatric formulations by investigating the dosage form attributes of currently UK licensed cardiovascular and Parkinson's disease drug products. Medication available in the UK for cardiovascular disorders and Parkinson's disease were screened and the available formulations, packaging and patient information leaflets of these medicines were analysed, with the goal of raising awareness of the need to cater for elderly patients with increasing difficulty in managing their medication. It emerged that although cardiovascular disorders and Parkinson's disease are more prevalent in older people, many treatment options have not been optimised for this cohort. In particular, older patient centred dosage forms, specific dosing requirements, excipients, patient-friendly packaging and easy-to-follow patient information were highlighted as areas to be considered in order to optimise health outcomes in the ageing population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular disease", "Dosage form", "Excipient", "Older people", "Parkinson's disease", "Polypharmacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Dosage Forms", "Drug Labeling", "Drug Packaging", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920836879", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57205373200": {"Name": "Hanning S.", "AuthorID": "57205373200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}, "56479100300": {"Name": "Muhamed J.", "AuthorID": "56479100300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}, "55761363900": {"Name": "Orlu-Gul M.", "AuthorID": "55761363900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}}}
