Using single particle cryo EM and image processing we have examined complexes of E. coli GroEL with the stringently GroE-dependent substrate enzyme RuBisCO from Rhodospirillum rubrum. Here we present snapshots of non-native RuBisCO - GroEL complexes. We observe two distinct substrate densities in the binary complex reminiscent of the two-domain structure of the RuBisCO subunit, so that this may represent a captured form of an early folding intermediate. The occupancy of the complex is consistent with the negative cooperativity of GroEL with respect to substrate binding, in accordance with earlier mass spectroscopy studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chaperonin", "GroEL", "Non-native protein", "Protein folding", "RuBisCO", "Single particle cryo-EM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chaperonin 60", "Escherichia coli", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Folding", "Rhodospirillum rubrum", "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049310398", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603191181": {"Name": "Natesh R.", "AuthorID": "6603191181", "AffiliationID": "60103629", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram"}, "7003967686": {"Name": "Clare D.", "AuthorID": "7003967686", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Electron Bio-Imaging Centre, Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science & Innovation campus"}, "35492295700": {"Name": "Saibil H.", "AuthorID": "35492295700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Crystallography and Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College London"}, "7005323310": {"Name": "Farr G.", "AuthorID": "7005323310", "AffiliationID": "120897255", "AffiliationName": "Aeromics, Inc."}, "7102049060": {"Name": "Horwich A.", "AuthorID": "7102049060", "AffiliationID": "60017994, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University School of Medicine"}}}
