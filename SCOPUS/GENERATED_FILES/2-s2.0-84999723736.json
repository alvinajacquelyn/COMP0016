We show that in certain cases some basic and plausible principles governing our reasoning come into conflict. In particular, we show that there is a simple argument that a person may be in a position to know a conditional the consequent of which has a low probability conditional on its antecedent, contra Adams\u2019 Thesis. We suggest that the puzzle motivates a very strong restriction on the inference of a conditional from a disjunction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999723736", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"26429930800": {"Name": "Rothschild D.", "AuthorID": "26429930800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24077712100": {"Name": "Spectre L.", "AuthorID": "24077712100", "AffiliationID": "60022591", "AffiliationName": "The Open University of Israel"}}}
