The present author conducted a review of old literature since the birth of human stereotactic neurosurgery in 1947 and established the following: (1) The first applications of DBS in the early 1950s were in the field of psychiatry, and promoted mainly by neurologists and psychiatrists without involvement of neurosurgeons. (2) Some of these old psychiatric applications of DBS were found to be dubious and precarious even by yesterday\u2019s ethical standards. (3) Modern DBS for psychiatric illness started in 1999 on the initiative of neurosurgeons who had involved from the beginning psychiatrists, and it had nothing to do with non-motor side-effects of STN DBS.
