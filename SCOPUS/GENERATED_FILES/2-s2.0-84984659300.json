We have recently shown that treatment with exendin-4 (Ex-4), an analog of the proglucagonderived molecule glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), markedly increases mRNA expression of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hypothalamus and hindbrain and that this increase partly mediates the suppression of food intake and body weight by Ex-4. Endogenous GLP-1 in the central nervous system (CNS) is produced by preproglucagon (PPG) neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the hindbrain. These neurons project to various parts of the brain, including the hypothalamus. Outside the brain, IL-6 stimulates GLP-1 secretion from the gut and pancreas. In this study, we aim to investigate whether IL-6 can affect GLP-1-producing PPG neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in mouse hindbrain via the ligand binding part of the IL-6 receptor, IL-6 receptor-\u03b1 (IL-6R\u03b1). Using immunohistochemistry, we found that IL-6R\u03b1 was localized on PPG neurons of the NTS. Recordings of these neurons in GCaMP3/GLP-1 reporter mice showed that IL-6 enhances cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in neurons capable of expressing PPG. We also show that the Ca2+ increase originates from the extracellular space. Furthermore, we found that IL-6R\u03b1 was localized on cells in the caudal hindbrain expressing immunoreactive NeuN (a neuronal marker) or CNP:ase (an oligodendrocyte marker). In summary, IL-6R\u03b1 is present on PPG neurons in the NTS, and IL-6 can stimulate these cells by increasing influx of Ca2+ to the cytosol from the extracellular space.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glucagon-like peptide-1", "Hindbrain", "IL-6", "IL-6R\u03b1", "Preproglucagon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Calcium", "Extracellular Space", "Glucagon-Like Peptide 1", "Interleukin-6", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "Nuclear Proteins", "Proglucagon", "Receptors, Interleukin-6", "Rhombencephalon", "Solitary Nucleus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984659300", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55750963200": {"Name": "Anesten F.", "AuthorID": "55750963200", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "23036546600": {"Name": "Sch\u00e9le E.", "AuthorID": "23036546600", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "15060324400": {"Name": "P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir V.", "AuthorID": "15060324400", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "57190948000": {"Name": "Safari C.", "AuthorID": "57190948000", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "23013511800": {"Name": "Skibicka K.P.", "AuthorID": "23013511800", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "7102590780": {"Name": "Jansson J.O.", "AuthorID": "7102590780", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "56797616700": {"Name": "Holt M.K.", "AuthorID": "56797616700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56441808800": {"Name": "Trapp S.", "AuthorID": "56441808800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57203082682": {"Name": "Reimann F.", "AuthorID": "57203082682", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "7004733731": {"Name": "Gribble F.M.", "AuthorID": "7004733731", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}}}
