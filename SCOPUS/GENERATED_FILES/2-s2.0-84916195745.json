Following a prospective protocol 29 consecutive patients with DES-ISR were sequentially treated with BA and new DES implantation under a multimodality intracoronary imaging assessment including intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Imaging studies were systematically obtained, at baseline, after BA, and after DES.Results of interventions were compared using volumetric and morphometric (ISR pattern and injury score) analyses.Results IVUS and OCT demonstrated that acute lumen gain after BA and DES equally results from a reduction in intra-stent neointimal volume and further DES expansion. As compared with BA, repeat DES implantation not only increased final lumen (baseline 39.6 \u00b1 18.5 mm3, post-BA 58.6 \u00b1 26.6 mm3, post-DES 84.2 \u00b1 30.8 mm3, all p < 0.001) but also provided a smoother lumen (injury score 1.57 \u00b1 0.86 vs 0.22 \u00b1 0.26, p < 0.001). At the 9th month of angiographic follow-up (86% patients) in-stent late loss was 0.44 \u00b1 0.5 mm and 4 patients (16%) developed ISR. The ISR pattern on OCT was not associated with the injury score after interventions or late angiographic findings. Likewise, the injury score did not predict late angiographic outcome.Conclusions In patients with DES ISR, lumen gain equally results from a reduction in intra-stent neointimal volume and further DES expansion. As compared with BA, repeat DES implantation provides a larger and smoother coronary lumen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Balloon angioplasty", "Drug-eluting stents", "In-stent restenosis", "Intravascular ultrasound", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary", "Coronary Restenosis", "Drug-Eluting Stents", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916195745", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7102111515": {"Name": "Alfonso F.", "AuthorID": "7102111515", "AffiliationID": "60024257, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "36868028800": {"Name": "Rivero F.", "AuthorID": "36868028800", "AffiliationID": "60024257, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "57197388695": {"Name": "Sandoval J.", "AuthorID": "57197388695", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "6603237185": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Vizcayno M.", "AuthorID": "6603237185", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "55629422400": {"Name": "C\u00e1rdenas A.", "AuthorID": "55629422400", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "24484668300": {"Name": "Gonzalo N.", "AuthorID": "24484668300", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "8873531300": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Quevedo P.", "AuthorID": "8873531300", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "23025470300": {"Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Gil I.", "AuthorID": "23025470300", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "7003913293": {"Name": "Escaned J.", "AuthorID": "7003913293", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "7005318939": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Ort\u00edz A.", "AuthorID": "7005318939", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}, "6506673631": {"Name": "Macaya C.", "AuthorID": "6506673631", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario San Carlos"}}}
