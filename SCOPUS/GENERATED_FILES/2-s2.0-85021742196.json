The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) assess their functioning. Using a person-centred approach of the ANPS, this study: (i) examined the existence of latent personality profiles, (ii) studied their gender invariance, (iii) assessed their longitudinal (4 years) stability, and (iv) explored how they relate to several intrapersonal, interpersonal, and emotion regulation skills. Latent Profile Analysis in 2 samples (Canadian, longitudinal, N = 520; French, cross-sectional, N = 830) found that, qualitatively, 3 profiles characterized both populations and genders, with one distinction for the second profile where the French women endorsed slightly higher and lower scores for, respectively, the negative and positive emotions. Whilst not being quantitatively similar across genders, the personality profiles remained consistent across time in the longitudinal sample. Associations between profiles and intrapersonal (e.g. depression), interpersonal (e.g. empathy), and emotion regulation skills measures (e.g. emotional intelligence) offered concurrent validity evidence. This person centred approach to ANPS offers a holistic and parsimonious way to study affective personality dimensions. It opens promising avenues for future studies on the predictive value of ANPS profiles, and for personality-targeted interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affect", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Models, Statistical", "Neurosciences", "Personality", "Personality Disorders", "Social Skills"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021742196", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55507171600": {"Name": "Orri M.", "AuthorID": "55507171600", "AffiliationID": "60005610, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit on Children's Psychosocial Maladjustment, Centre de Recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, University of Montreal"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "24460456300": {"Name": "Rouquette A.", "AuthorID": "24460456300", "AffiliationID": "60029621, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "AP-HP, H\u00f4tel-Dieu Hospital, Biostatistics and Epidemiology Department"}, "7003400734": {"Name": "Falissard B.", "AuthorID": "7003400734", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60029937, 60106017, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "CESP, INSERM, Univ.
