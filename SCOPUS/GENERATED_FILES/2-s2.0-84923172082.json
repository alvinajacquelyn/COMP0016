We combine the strong liver tropism of serotype-8 capsid-pseudotyped adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV8) with a liver-specific promoter (HLP) and microRNA-122a (miR-122a)-mediated posttranscriptional regulation. Systemic administration of our AAV8 construct resulted in preferential transduction of the liver and encouragingly of HCC at heterotopic sites, a finding that could be exploited to target disseminated disease. Tumor selectivity was enhanced by inclusion of miR-122a-binding sequences (ssAAV8-HLP-TK-122aT4) in the expression cassette, resulting in abrogation of transgene expression in normal murine liver but not in HCC. Systemic administration of our tumor-selective vector encoding herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene resulted in a sevenfold reduction in HCC growth in a syngeneic murine model without toxicity. In summary, we have developed a systemically deliverable gene transfer approach that enables high-level expression of therapeutic genes in HCC but not normal tissues, thus improving the prospects of safe and effective treatment for advanced HCC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Capsid", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Dependovirus", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Liver", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, SCID", "MicroRNAs", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Recombinant Proteins", "Simplexvirus", "Thymidine Kinase", "Tissue Distribution", "Transplantation, Heterotopic", "Viral Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923172082", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"16068160000": {"Name": "Della Peruta M.", "AuthorID": "16068160000", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "8973917300": {"Name": "Chokshi S.", "AuthorID": "8973917300", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Hepatology, Foundation for Liver Research"}, "7409607221": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "7409607221", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Hepatology, Foundation for Liver Research"}, "54394267900": {"Name": "Rosales C.", "AuthorID": "54394267900", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "57205041971": {"Name": "Kia A.", "AuthorID": "57205041971", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "54393955700": {"Name": "Nathwani D.", "AuthorID": "54393955700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.C.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia Centre and Thrombosis Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "36993672300": {"Name": "Badar A.", "AuthorID": "36993672300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "13002892600": {"Name": "Galante E.", "AuthorID": "13002892600", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "45061089600": {"Name": "Yan R.", "AuthorID": "45061089600", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507965888": {"Name": "Arstad E.", "AuthorID": "6507965888", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006576814": {"Name": "Davidoff A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006576814", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}}
