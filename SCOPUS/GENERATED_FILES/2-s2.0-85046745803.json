Among various approaches, passive radio frequency sensing is a well-tried radar principle that has potential to provide the unique solution for non-invasive activity detection and recognition. However, this technology is still far from mature. This paper presents a novel hidden Markov model-based log-likelihood matrix for characterizing the Doppler shifts to break the fixed sliding window limitation in traditional feature extraction approaches. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method by K-means K-medoids clustering algorithms with experimental Doppler data gathered from a passive radar system. The results show that the time adaptive log-likelihood matrix outperforms the traditional singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, and physical feature-based approaches, and reaches 80% in recognizing rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Doppler radar", "Human activity recognition", "log-likelihood matrix", "passive sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity recognition", "Human activity recognition", "Log likelihood", "Passive radars", "Passive sensing", "Radio frequencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046745803", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190582547": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57190582547", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "57190289593": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57190289593", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "7003301240": {"Name": "Piechocki R.", "AuthorID": "7003301240", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "56342423200": {"Name": "Tan B.", "AuthorID": "56342423200", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics, Coventry University"}}}
