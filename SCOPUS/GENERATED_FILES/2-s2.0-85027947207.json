These included feminism, maternity care activism, the increasing medicalisation of childbirth, and evidence-based health care. This paper uses the author's own sociological \u2018career\u2019 to map a journey through four decades of childbirth research. It demonstrates the importance of social networks and interdisciplinary work, particularly across the medical-social science divide and including cross-cultural perspectives, argues that the study of reproduction has facilitated methodological development within the social sciences, and suggests that childbirth remains on the periphery of mainstream sociological concerns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["childbirth", "health policy", "medicalisation", "midwifery", "obstetrics/obstetricians", "patient and public engagement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027947207", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7005972551": {"Name": "Oakley A.", "AuthorID": "7005972551", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, Social Science Research Unit"}}}
