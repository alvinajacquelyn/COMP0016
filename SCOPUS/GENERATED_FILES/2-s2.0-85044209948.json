All rights reserved.Introduction In advanced chronic liver disease, diseases caused by common bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae or influenza virus put people at an increased risk of serious health complications and death. The effectiveness of the available vaccines in reducing the risk of poor health outcomes, however, is less clear. Methods and analysis We will search Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for published reports on randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the effectiveness of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines in people with chronic liver disease. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies for eligibility, extract data and assess study quality and risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses will be performed as appropriate. Ethics and dissemination Formal ethical approval is not required, as no primary data will be collected for this study. We will publish results of this study in relevant peer-reviewed medical journal or journals. Where possible, the study results will also be presented as posters or talks at relevant medical conferences and meetings.
