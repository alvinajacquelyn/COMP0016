Investigation of these cytopenias revealed the presence of lineage specific auto- and allo-antibodies, which were not present in either the donor or in the recipient prior to the viral infection. This case provides further evidence for the concept that viral challenges following HSCT can result in the production of cell specific antibodies that can have significant implications for patient management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Late onset cytopenias following HSCT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Agranulocytosis", "Allografts", "Autoantibodies", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Isoantibodies", "Male", "Thrombocytopenia", "Virus Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014732617", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"7201932159": {"Name": "Lucas G.", "AuthorID": "7201932159", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Histocompatibility & Immunogenetics, National Blood and Transplant"}, "36980613400": {"Name": "Culliford S.", "AuthorID": "36980613400", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Histocompatibility & Immunogenetics, National Blood and Transplant"}, "6602622951": {"Name": "Bendukidze N.", "AuthorID": "6602622951", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Histocompatibility & Immunogenetics, National Blood and Transplant"}, "57193540097": {"Name": "Dahlstrom J.", "AuthorID": "57193540097", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adolescent Haematology, University College Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508363080": {"Name": "Grandage V.", "AuthorID": "6508363080", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adolescent Haematology, University College Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102495795": {"Name": "Carpenter B.", "AuthorID": "7102495795", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adolescent Haematology, University College Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9941088900": {"Name": "Hough R.", "AuthorID": "9941088900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adolescent Haematology, University College Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
