To evaluate the flood influencing factors in the upper Jhelum basin, we delineate the upper Jhelum basin into ten sub-basins, followed by extraction of drainage network and morphometric parameters using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer digital elevation model and topographic maps in Geographic Information System. The overall flood potential was determined on the basis of compound value obtained for all morphometric parameters of each sub-basin. The analysis reveals that, in general, the northeastern segment of the upper Jhelum basin reveals comparative higher flood potential than the southwestern segment. The tributaries, such as Lidder, Veshav, Arapal, Arapat, and Bring, exhibit greater potential to produce peak flows during rainfall events, while the tributaries like Dudhganga, Rambiara, Sandran, Romushi, and Sasara express moderate-to-low flood potential, respectively. The results of this study are likely to be very useful for effective flood hazard mitigation in upper Jhelum floodplain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flood hazard evaluation", "Kashmir valley", "Morphometric parameters", "Upper Jhelum basin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer", "Digital elevation model", "Flood hazard assessment", "Flood hazards", "Kashmir valley", "Morphometric parameters", "Physical characteristics", "Upper Jhelum basin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060206074", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"57211612511": {"Name": "Bhat M.S.", "AuthorID": "57211612511", "AffiliationID": "60016300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Regional Development, University of Kashmir"}, "55991333400": {"Name": "Alam A.", "AuthorID": "55991333400", "AffiliationID": "60016300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Regional Development, University of Kashmir"}, "55513308900": {"Name": "Ahmad S.", "AuthorID": "55513308900", "AffiliationID": "60016300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Regional Development, University of Kashmir"}, "57201668911": {"Name": "Farooq H.", "AuthorID": "57201668911", "AffiliationID": "60016300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Regional Development, University of Kashmir"}, "56819260800": {"Name": "Ahmad B.", "AuthorID": "56819260800", "AffiliationID": "117792135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Nawakadal School"}}}
