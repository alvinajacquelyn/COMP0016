Methods We diagnosed 22 affected individuals belonging to eight families and 43 sporadic cases with FTD in Apulia, Southern Italy, in 2 years. Mutations in common causative FTD genes (GRN, MAPT, VCP, and TARDBP) and C9ORF72 expansions were screened. Results Behavioral variant of FTD was the most common clinical subtype (50% and 69% in familial and sporadic cases, respectively). Social conduct impairment/disinhibition, loss of insight, and inflexibility were the most frequent clinical features observed at onset. One new mutation was identified in GRN in family A. Discussion Disease onset in sporadic FTD was more frequently characterized by a clustering of behavioral symptoms with apathy and loss of personal hygiene. Mutations in common causative FTD genes are not a major cause of familial and sporadic FTD in the Southern Italian population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral variant of FTD", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Primary progressive aphasia: familial", "Semantic dementia", "Sporadic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "C9orf72 Protein", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Family", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Italy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Registries", "tau Proteins", "Valosin Containing Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016632632", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"36467923800": {"Name": "Capozzo R.", "AuthorID": "36467923800", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research in Neurology, University of Bari, \u201cPia Fondazione Cardinale G.
