Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdPurpose: To evaluate the difference between endothelium-in and endothelium-out for Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) preparation and implantation using injection method. Methods: The study was a randomized, comparative, institutional, laboratory investigation. Eighteen human donor corneas were included. A total of 9.5 mm DMEK grafts were stripped and restored on the corneal base with a hinge and preserved in the deswelling medium. The grafts were detached from the hinge and either manually tri-folded with the endothelium on the inside, or allowed to spontaneously roll in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with endothelium outwards. The corneas were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber (AAC) and four incisions made using a 15\u00b0 eye knife for the side ports and slit knife to create a 3.0 mm incision for delivery of the graft into the AAC. The grafts with endothelium-in (endo-in) were pulled into a cartridge, whereas those with endothelium-out (endo-out) were aspirated using a modified Jones tube. Both were delivered using an injection method. Central and peripheral endothelial cell density (pre- and post-delivery and after removal), time of preparation and unfolding were measured. Results: Endothelial cell loss postimplantation was 10.53% (\u00b12.82) with endo-in (n = 9) compared to 7.56% (\u00b114.74) with endo-out (n = 9) (p > 0.05). Preparation and unfolding time was 4.43 min (\u00b13.43) and 0.96 min (\u00b11.10) for endo-in compared to 1.68 min (\u00b10.57) and 4.92 min (\u00b14.21) for endo-out. A statistical significance between endo-in and endo-out for loading (p = 0.04) and unfolding (p = 0.023) time was observed. Conclusions: Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty tissues can be tri-folded (endo-in) with no significantly less cell loss as compared to endo-out. Spontaneous unfolding of endo-in may reduce overall time and surgical manipulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty", "endothelium-in", "endothelium-out", "preparation", "transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cell Count", "Descemet Membrane", "Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Female", "Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy", "Humans", "Male", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Tissue Donors", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978388525", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "8681862500": {"Name": "Ruzza A.", "AuthorID": "8681862500", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57190211074": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "57190211074", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "6603422101": {"Name": "Ponzin D.", "AuthorID": "6603422101", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57203480864": {"Name": "Ahmad S.", "AuthorID": "57203480864", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "St Paul's Eye Unit, Department of Eye and Vision Science, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "7201931356": {"Name": "Kaye S.", "AuthorID": "7201931356", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "St Paul's Eye Unit, Department of Eye and Vision Science, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "25960336600": {"Name": "Romano V.", "AuthorID": "25960336600", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "St Paul's Eye Unit, Department of Eye and Vision Science, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}}}
