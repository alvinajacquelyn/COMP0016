Both scaffolds showed absence of cells, preservation of ECM and mechanical properties comparable to non-decellularised skin before implantation. Host cell infiltration was much prominent on both scaffolds when compared to Permacol (surgical control). At day 3, the grafts were surrounded by polymorphonuclear cells, which were replaced by a notable number of IL-6-positive cells at day 14. Simultaneously, the number of pro-inflammatory M1-macrophage was enhanced. Interestingly, a predominant pro-remodeling M2 response, with newly formed vessels, myofibroblasts activation and a shift on the type of collagen expression was sequentially delayed (around 21 days). The gene expression of some trophic factors involved in tissue remodeling was congruent with the cellular events. Our findings suggested that the responsiveness of macrophages after non-crosslinked skin scaffolds implantation seemed to intimately affect various cell responses and molecular events; and this range of mutually reinforcing actions was predictive of a positive tissue remodeling that was essential for the long-standing success of the implants. Furthermore, our study indicates that non-crosslinked biologic scaffold implantation is biocompatible to the host tissue and somehow underlying molecular events involved in tissue repair.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Dermatologic Surgical Procedures", "Rats, Wistar", "Swine", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991503724", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55279696000": {"Name": "Mimura K.K.O.", "AuthorID": "55279696000", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Post-Graduation in Structural and Functional Biology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP)"}, "6603399982": {"Name": "Oliani S.M.", "AuthorID": "6603399982", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias, Letras e Ci\u00eancias Exatas, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)"}, "57191540732": {"Name": "Moraes A.R.", "AuthorID": "57191540732", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias, Letras e Ci\u00eancias Exatas, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)"}, "55444895800": {"Name": "Miranda A.C.", "AuthorID": "55444895800", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias, Letras e Ci\u00eancias Exatas, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)"}, "57191541806": {"Name": "Greco R.", "AuthorID": "57191541806", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60189084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Research, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003597902": {"Name": "Ansari T.", "AuthorID": "7003597902", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60189084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Research, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203614283": {"Name": "Sibbons P.", "AuthorID": "57203614283", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60189084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Research, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, University College London (UCL)"}, "57062516200": {"Name": "Greco K.V.", "AuthorID": "57062516200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60189084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Research, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, University College London (UCL)"}}}
