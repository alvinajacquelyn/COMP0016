Despite this, no genotype-phenotype correlations are currently recognised. We performed a retrospective review of electronic patient records to identify patients with macular dystrophy due to bi-allelic variants in CRB1. In total, seven unrelated individuals were identified. The median age at presentation was 21 years, with a median acuity of 0.55 decimalised Snellen units (IQR = 0.43). The follow-up period ranged from 0 to 19 years (median = 2.0 years), with a median final decimalised Snellen acuity of 0.65 (IQR = 0.70). Fundoscopy revealed only a subtly altered foveal reflex, which evolved into a bull's-eye pattern of outer retinal atrophy. Optical coherence tomography identified structural changes - intraretinal cysts in the early stages of disease, and later outer retinal atrophy. Genetic testing revealed that one rare allele (c.498-506del, p.(Ile167-Gly169del)) was present in all patients, with one patient being homozygous for the variant and six being heterozygous. In trans with this, one variant recurred twice (p.(Cys896Ter)), while the four remaining alleles were each observed once (p.(Pro1381Thr), p.(Ser478ProfsTer24), p.(Cys195Phe) and p.(Arg764Cys)). These findings show that the rare CRB1 variant, c.498-506del, is strongly associated with localised retinal dysfunction. The clinical findings are much milder than those observed with bi-allelic, loss-of-function variants in CRB1, suggesting this in-frame deletion acts as a hypomorphic allele. This is the most prevalent disease-causing CRB1 variant identified in the non-Asian population to date.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Alleles", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Electronic Health Records", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Retinal Photoreceptor Cell Outer Segment", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041617943", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.N.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. James's University Teaching Hospital"}, "6507036910": {"Name": "Mahroo O.A.R.", "AuthorID": "6507036910", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Disease Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Disease Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, University of California San Francisco Medical School"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Disease Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57200553463": {"Name": "Armengol M.", "AuthorID": "57200553463", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Disease Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005833622": {"Name": "Inglehearn C.F.", "AuthorID": "7005833622", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Section of Ophthalmology and Neuroscience, Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "6602825232": {"Name": "Waseem N.", "AuthorID": "6602825232", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Section of Ophthalmology and Neuroscience, Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7004041333": {"Name": "McKibbin M.", "AuthorID": "7004041333", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. James's University Teaching Hospital"}, "35784796900": {"Name": "Poulter J.A.", "AuthorID": "35784796900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Section of Ophthalmology and Neuroscience, Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "57203259026": {"Name": "Robson A.", "AuthorID": "57203259026", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrophysiology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102202117": {"Name": "Holder G.E.", "AuthorID": "7102202117", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrophysiology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "36520865300": {"Name": "Carss K.J.", "AuthorID": "36520865300", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "16639404000": {"Name": "Raymond L.F.", "AuthorID": "16639404000", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "56213114800": {"Name": "Van Genderen M.M.", "AuthorID": "56213114800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
