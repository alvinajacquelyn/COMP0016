Huitfeldt recounts that he first encountered computing at the beginning of the 1980s via the Institute of Continental Shelf Research when he was a Philosophy student at the University of Trondheim. However, it was in connection with a Humanities project on the writings of Wittgenstein that he learned to programme. When that project closed he worked as a computing consultant in the Norwegian Computing Center for the Humanities and in 1990 he established a new project called the \u2018Wittgenstein Archives\u2019, which aimed to prepare and publish a machine-readable version of Wittgenstein\u2019s Nachlass. Here he discusses the context in which he began working on the encoding scheme (A Multi-Element Code System) that he developed for that project. The influence of MECS went beyond the Wittgenstein Archives. According to Ore (2014) \u2018when XML itself was under development, the idea of well-formed documents (as different from documents valid according to a DTD or schema) was taken into XML from MECS\u2019. In addition to discussing matters like the trajectory of DH research and his early encounters with the conference community he also discusses some of the fundamental issues that interest him like the role of technology in relation to the written word and the lack of engagement of the Philosophy community with such questions. Ultimately he concludes that he does not view DH as a discipline, but rather as a reconfiguration of the academic landscape as a result of the convergence of tools and methods within and between the Humanities and other disciplines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Code System", "Continental Shelf", "Encode Scheme", "High Expectation", "Human Computer Interaction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067993446", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56173511400": {"Name": "Nyhan J.", "AuthorID": "56173511400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London (UCL)"}, "22950668700": {"Name": "Flinn A.", "AuthorID": "22950668700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London (UCL)"}}}
