Governing bodies, sports clinicians, and indeed athletes themselves are dealing with the implications that this injury brings. In parallel with this, innovative means of managing this condition are emerging. The creation of specialized concussion clinics (which mirror those present in the United States and Canada) is one means of enhancing concussion care in the UK. In this chapter, the emergence of concussion clinics in the UK will be discussed. The specific roles of the multidisciplinary teams working in these clinics will be outlined (including the disciplines of sports medicine, radiology, neurology, physiotherapy, and psychology/psychiatry), and the approaches used in the management of concussion in this setting will be explored. Future recommendations for the growth and development of clinic-based concussion care in the UK will also be discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concussion", "Mild traumatic brain injury", "Neurology", "Public health", "Sports medicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Athletic Injuries", "Brain Concussion", "Humans", "Neurology", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Public Health", "Sports Medicine", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027563787", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36494002400": {"Name": "Ahmed O.H.", "AuthorID": "36494002400", "AffiliationID": "114204816", "AffiliationName": "The FA Centre for Disability Football Research St George's Park"}, "22941686000": {"Name": "Loosemore M.", "AuthorID": "22941686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport and Exercise Health, University College London"}, "57195380818": {"Name": "Hornby K.", "AuthorID": "57195380818", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport and Exercise Health, University College London"}, "56692158300": {"Name": "Kumar B.", "AuthorID": "56692158300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport and Exercise Health, University College London"}, "57192067311": {"Name": "Sylvester R.", "AuthorID": "57192067311", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56618780100": {"Name": "de Medici A.", "AuthorID": "56618780100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport and Exercise Health, University College London"}, "56986609300": {"Name": "Makalanda H.L.", "AuthorID": "56986609300", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital"}, "57195377689": {"Name": "Rogers T.", "AuthorID": "57195377689", "AffiliationID": "118242750", "AffiliationName": "Cognacity"}, "57214402686": {"Name": "Edwards D.", "AuthorID": "57214402686", "AffiliationID": "60014635", "AffiliationName": "University of Zululand"}}}
