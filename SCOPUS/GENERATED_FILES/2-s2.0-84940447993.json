IR injury plays a central role in both native and transplant acute kidney injury (AKI). Native AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hospital inpatients, and transplant AKI contributes to graft dysfunction, ultimately limiting graft longevity. In this review, we discuss the potential therapeutic benefits of a cost-effective and low-risk intervention, remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), and its applicability in the prevention and reduction of AKI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute kidney injury", "Ischaemia\u2013reperfusion", "Remote ischaemic preconditioning", "Therapeutic benefits", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Animals", "Global Health", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Incidence", "Ischemic Preconditioning", "Organ Transplantation", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940447993", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"36703723300": {"Name": "Veighey K.", "AuthorID": "36703723300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "57204577870": {"Name": "MacAllister R.", "AuthorID": "57204577870", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University College London"}}}
