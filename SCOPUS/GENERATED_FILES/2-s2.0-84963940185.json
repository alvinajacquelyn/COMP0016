This results in an estimator which is able to exploit the spatial regularities of a piecewise parametric varying Hurst parameter. The pointwise estimates are jointly inferred along with the parametric form of the underlying Hurst function which characterises how the Hurst parameter varies deterministically over the spatial support of the data. Unlike recent Hurst regularisation methods, the proposed approach is flexible in that arbitrary parametric forms can be considered and is extensible in as much as the associated gradient descent algorithm can accommodate a broad class of distributional assumptions without any significant modifications. The potential benefits of the approach are illustrated with simulations of various first-order polynomial forms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gradient descent algorithms", "Hurst estimator", "Hurst parameter", "Markov Random Field model", "Markov Random Fields", "Parametric forms", "Pointwise estimate", "Potential benefits"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963940185", "SubjectAreas": [["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57188861811": {"Name": "Regli J.", "AuthorID": "57188861811", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57213634767": {"Name": "Nelson J.", "AuthorID": "57213634767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
