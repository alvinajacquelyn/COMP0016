Further challenges exist where mudbrick remains have been exposed and abandoned, as interactions with the environment (especially water and wind) introduce additional dissolution and damage of the resource. In this paper, we present multidisciplinary research focused on the interpretation and preservation of ancient and vernacular mudbrick architecture in the Marmara Lake Basin in western Turkey. Of interest is the preservation of mudbrick and stone foundations at Kaymak\u00e7\u0131, a Middle to Late Bronze Age, ridge-top citadel. We demonstrate that utilizing multiple lines of evidence, including macromorphological, mineralogical, and chemical studies interpreted within the context of extant vernacular traditions in the region, produces a nuanced understanding of the archaeological evidence. Further, ethnographic and experimental archaeological research with local stakeholders allows for the development of a robust template for testing and implementing sustainable site-preservation strategies for in situ architecture with immediate communities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeology", "Conservation", "Ethnography", "Kaymak\u00e7\u0131", "Mudbrick", "Vernacular architecture", "Western Turkey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063670598", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"57208060758": {"Name": "O\u2019Grady C.", "AuthorID": "57208060758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "23967769000": {"Name": "Luke C.", "AuthorID": "23967769000", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and History of Art, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "24781171400": {"Name": "Roosevelt C.", "AuthorID": "24781171400", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and History of Art, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "57208057053": {"Name": "Mokri\u0161ov\u00e1 J.", "AuthorID": "57208057053", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan"}}}
