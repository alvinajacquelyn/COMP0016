Clinical accounts describe avoidance strategies including apparently strategic use of distraction or socially shocking behaviour, and obsessive need for control, reflected in domineering behaviour to peers and adults. Educational and management approaches effective for PDA reportedly differ from those for \u2018typical\u2019 autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and include novelty, humour and flexibility. Identification of PDA in individuals with ASD may have important implications for management (Eaton and Banting, J Learn Disabil Offending Behav 3:150\u2013157, 2012). Despite increasing interest, no clinician-rated instrument for PDA has been developed. Here, items relevant to PDA were identified from the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorder (DISCO) (Wing et al., J Child Psychol Psychiatry 43:307\u2013325, 2002). The most PDA-specific subset of relevant DISCO items was selected, based on low endorsement in general across a sample of 153 individuals assessed for possible ASD using the DISCO. Having selected 11 DISCO PDA items for the measure, a subset of individuals with a high number of these features was identified (N = 27). Consistent with Newson\u2019s descriptions, this high scoring group was characterised by lack of co-operation, use of apparently manipulative behaviour, socially shocking behaviour, difficulties with other people, anxiety and sudden behavioural changes from loving to aggression. All but one case met criteria for an ASD. This study brings the field a step closer to a clinician-rated measure of PDA features and highlights the need for further elucidation of the PDA phenotype.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)", "Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO)", "Pathological demand avoidance (PDA)", "Pervasive developmental disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Child, Preschool", "Communication Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Interview, Psychological", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Social Behavior Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938535253", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56755387300": {"Name": "O\u2019Nions E.", "AuthorID": "56755387300", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "23091807800": {"Name": "Viding E.", "AuthorID": "23091807800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Developmental Risk & Resilience Unit, Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology Research Department, University College London"}, "7004098522": {"Name": "Happ\u00e9 F.", "AuthorID": "7004098522", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7201688916": {"Name": "Gould J.", "AuthorID": "7201688916", "AffiliationID": "107937698", "AffiliationName": "The NAS Lorna Wing Centre for Autism"}, "36837585000": {"Name": "Christie P.", "AuthorID": "36837585000", "AffiliationID": "115517904", "AffiliationName": "The Elizabeth Newson Centre, Sutherland House Children\u2019s Services (NORSACA)"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}}}
