The measurements were performed in the time domain by combining high-resolution continuous-wave laser photoexcitation and pulsed electric field ionization. The observed tunnel ionization rates range from 105 to 107s-1 and have, together with the measured atomic energy-level structure in the corresponding electric fields, been compared to the results of calculations of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix describing the atoms in the presence of the fields to which complex absorbing potentials have been introduced. The comparison of the measured tunnel ionization rates with the results of these, and additional calculations for hydrogenlike Rydberg states performed using semiempirical methods, have allowed the accuracy of these methods of calculation to be tested. For the particular eigenstates studied the measured ionization rates are \u223c5 times larger than those obtained from semiempirical expressions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex absorbing potentials", "Hamiltonian matrix", "Ionization dynamics", "Ionization thresholds", "Principal quantum numbers", "Pulsed electric field", "Semi-empirical methods", "Strong electric fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060170655", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57205476891": {"Name": "Gawlas K.", "AuthorID": "57205476891", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "17434872000": {"Name": "Hogan S.", "AuthorID": "17434872000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
