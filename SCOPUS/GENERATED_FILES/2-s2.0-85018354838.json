The probability distribution of gaze movements and clustering of gaze points, registered with eye-tracking technology, was studied during a free visual exploration of a gaze stimulus. A data-driven analysis of the distribution of eye movements was chosen to overcome any possible methodological problems related to the subjective expectations of the experimenters about the informative contents of the image in addition to a computational model to simulate group differences. Analysis of the eye-tracking data indicated that the scanpaths of children with TD and ASD were characterized by eye movements geometrically equivalent to L\u00e9vy flights. Children with ASD showed a higher frequency of long saccadic amplitudes compared with controls. A clustering analysis revealed a greater dispersion of eye movements for these children. Modeling of the results indicated higher values of the model parameter modulating the dispersion of eye movements for children with ASD. Together, the experimental results and the model point to a greater dispersion of gaze points in ASD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASD", "eye-tracking", "L\u00e9vy flight", "social visual attention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Eye Movement Measurements", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Physics", "Social Perception", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018354838", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57195056349": {"Name": "Liberati A.", "AuthorID": "57195056349", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Cagliari, Complesso Universitario di Monserrato"}, "24824317300": {"Name": "Fadda R.", "AuthorID": "24824317300", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pedagogy, Psychology, Philosophy, University of Cagliari"}, "36241366800": {"Name": "Doneddu G.", "AuthorID": "36241366800", "AffiliationID": "60083756", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu"}, "28267464200": {"Name": "Congiu S.", "AuthorID": "28267464200", "AffiliationID": "60083756", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu"}, "55601598500": {"Name": "Javarone M.", "AuthorID": "55601598500", "AffiliationID": "60010110", "AffiliationName": "DUMAS\u2014Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Sassari"}, "7004181055": {"Name": "Striano T.", "AuthorID": "7004181055", "AffiliationID": "60002896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Hunter College"}, "6604050350": {"Name": "Chessa A.", "AuthorID": "6604050350", "AffiliationID": "60102060", "AffiliationName": "IMT Institute for Advanced Studies"}}}
