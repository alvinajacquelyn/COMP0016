Deconvolution-based data analysis provides multiple scattering contrasts but suffers from time consuming data processing. Here, we propose a moment-based analysis that provides equivalent scattering contrasts while speeding up data analysis by almost three orders of magnitude. The availability of rapid data processing will be essential for applications that require instantaneous results such as medical diagnostics, production monitoring, and security screening. Further, we experimentally demonstrate that the additional scattering information provided by the moments with an order higher than two can be retrieved without increasing exposure time or dose.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Medical diagnostics", "Moment-based analysis", "Production monitoring", "Scattering contrast", "Scattering distributions", "Scattering information", "Scattering signals", "Three orders of magnitude"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059629913", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"14122046600": {"Name": "Modregger P.", "AuthorID": "14122046600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}}}
