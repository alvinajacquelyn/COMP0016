In-depth semi-structured interviews were used to collect narratives from 15 participants. Sources of social support constitute important mechanisms for coping with the illness experience of fibromyalgia. In providing a space for consultation and validation of the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and the person living with the condition, people giving support fulfil a critical role in shaping the experience. The findings show how support from family, partners, and peers plays an integral role in the process of accepting fibromyalgia diagnosis, adapting to the demands of the condition, and seeking help from healthcare providers. The findings also show the ways in which people with fibromyalgia provide support for others with the condition, and the importance of this peer network in shaping the paths and outcomes of this illness experience. The findings of this study corroborate existing evidence that show fibromyalgia to be a complex condition to manage, due to the multiplicity, uncertainty and contestation that feature in the experience of the illness. Additionally, this study presents the challenges related to the limitations of access to healthcare in the South African context, and the utility of narrative approaches in garnering insight into the ways in which social support is harnessed in this environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fibromyalgia", "patient narratives", "social support", "South Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Female", "Fibromyalgia", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Middle Aged", "Qualitative Research", "Social Support", "South Africa", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998698790", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55978216900": {"Name": "Cooper S.", "AuthorID": "55978216900", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "57212714642": {"Name": "Gilbert L.", "AuthorID": "57212714642", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of the Witwatersrand"}}}
