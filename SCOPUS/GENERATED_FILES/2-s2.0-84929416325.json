Little reason exists to separate them, since all three examine and aim to deal with many similar processes, including vulnerability and resilience. This article uses vulnerability and resilience to explore the intersections and overlaps amongst climate change, disaster risk reduction, and sustainability. Critiquing concepts such as \u201creturn to normal\u201d and \u201cdouble exposure\u201d demonstrate how separating climate change from wider contexts is counterproductive. Climate change is one contributor to disaster risk and one creeping environmental change amongst many, and not necessarily the most prominent or fundamental contributor. Yet climate change has become politically important, yielding an opportunity to highlight and tackle the deep-rooted vulnerability processes that cause \u201cmultiple exposure\u201d to multiple threats. To enhance resilience processes that deal with the challenges, a prudent place for climate change would be as a subset within disaster risk reduction. Climate change adaptation therefore becomes one of many processes within disaster risk reduction. In turn, disaster risk reduction should sit within development and sustainability to avoid isolation from topics wider than disaster risk. Integration of the topics in this way moves beyond expressions of vulnerability and resilience towards a vision of disaster risk reduction\u2019s future that ends tribalism and separation in order to work together to achieve common goals for humanity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Climate change", "Disaster risk reduction", "Mitigation", "Resilience", "Vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929416325", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60028086", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI)"}, "8702055300": {"Name": "Gaillard J.", "AuthorID": "8702055300", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, The University of Auckland"}, "23028133900": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "23028133900", "AffiliationID": "115723340", "AffiliationName": "Secure Futures"}}}
