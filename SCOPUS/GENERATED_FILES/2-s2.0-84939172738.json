Kidins220/ARMS is a downstream target of neurotrophin receptors and interacts with several signalling and trafficking factors. Through computational modelling, we found two potential sites for alternative splicing of Kidins220/ARMS. The first is located between exon 24 and exon 29, while the second site replaces exon 32 by a short alternative terminal exon 33. Here we describe the conserved occurrence of several Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms at RNA and protein levels. Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms display spatio-temporal regulation during development with distinct patterns in different neuronal populations. Neurotrophin receptor stimulation in cortical and hippocampal neurons and neuroendocrine cells induces specific Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms and alters the appearance kinetics of the full-length transcript. Remarkably, alternative terminal exon splicing generates Kidins220/ARMS variants with distinct cellular localisation: Kidins220/ARMS containing exon 32 is targeted to the plasma membrane and neurite tips, whereas Kidins220/ARMS without exon 33 mainly clusters the full-length protein in a perinuclear intracellular compartment in PC12 cells and primary neurons, leading to a change in neurotrophin receptor expression. Overall, this study demonstrates the existence of novel Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms with unique properties, revealing additional complexity in the functional regulation of neurotrophin receptors, and potentially other signalling pathways involved in neuronal and cardiovascular development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative Splicing", "Animals", "Brain", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Cardiovascular System", "Exons", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Nerve Growth Factor", "Neurons", "PC12 Cells", "Protein Isoforms", "Protein Transport", "Rats", "Receptor, trkA", "Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939172738", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"40262442900": {"Name": "Schmieg N.", "AuthorID": "40262442900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "57198066614": {"Name": "Lynch D.", "AuthorID": "57198066614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Wolfson Centre for Experimental Neurology, University College London"}, "7005744867": {"Name": "Schiavo G.", "AuthorID": "7005744867", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7404409365": {"Name": "Thomas C.", "AuthorID": "7404409365", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "53983352200": {"Name": "Yabe A.", "AuthorID": "53983352200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "55403192700": {"Name": "Chakravarty P.", "AuthorID": "55403192700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "57200997414": {"Name": "Iglesias T.", "AuthorID": "57200997414", "AffiliationID": "60085102, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBERNED (ISCIII)"}}}
