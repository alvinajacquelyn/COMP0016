Parents of London preschoolers with sickle cell anemia (SCA; n = 22), matched controls (n = 24), and unselected typically developing (n = 142) preschoolers completed sleep questionnaires. Preschoolers with SCA had significantly more sleep problems when compared to matched controls and the larger population. Snoring occurred at least one to two nights a week for 79% of the SCA group. This is compared with 25% of matched controls and 33% of larger population. Randomized controlled trials to improve sleep in young children with SCA already at-risk for cognitive dysfunction should be considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early intervention", "obstructive sleep apnea", "sickle cell disease", "sleep", "sleep disordered breathing", "snoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Parents", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005939270", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57204024918": {"Name": "Downes M.", "AuthorID": "57204024918", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "de Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "9744014700": {"Name": "Telfer P.T.", "AuthorID": "9744014700", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Barts Health NHS Trust, Royal London hospital"}}}
