All Rights Reserved.Streptococcus pneumoniae infections arising in hospitalized patients are often assumed to be sporadic and linked to community acquisition. Here, whole-genome sequencing was used to demonstrate nosocomial acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant sequence type 156 (ST156) serotype 9V S. pneumoniae in 3 respiratory patients that resulted in two bacteremias and one lower respiratory tract infection. Two of the cases arose in patients who had recently been discharged from the hospital and were readmitted from the community. Nosocomial spread was suspected solely because of the highly unusual resistance pattern and case presentations within 24 h of one another. The outbreak highlights the potential for rapid transmission and the short incubation period in the respiratory ward setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteremia", "Nosocomial infections", "Pneumonia", "Serotype 9V", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cross Infection", "Disease Outbreaks", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Female", "Genome, Bacterial", "Hospital Departments", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Serogroup", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014411265", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"55179453500": {"Name": "Jauneikaite E.", "AuthorID": "55179453500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6701743013": {"Name": "Sriskandan S.", "AuthorID": "6701743013", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57193501210": {"Name": "Khan-Orakzai Z.", "AuthorID": "57193501210", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57193498555": {"Name": "Bloch S.", "AuthorID": "57193498555", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "35958148100": {"Name": "Singleton J.", "AuthorID": "35958148100", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55899249900": {"Name": "Hatcher J.", "AuthorID": "55899249900", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "36341165800": {"Name": "Samarasinghe D.", "AuthorID": "36341165800", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "25626807100": {"Name": "Satta G.", "AuthorID": "25626807100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "24461696300": {"Name": "Kapatai G.", "AuthorID": "24461696300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England, National Infection Service"}, "7203006933": {"Name": "Sheppard C.", "AuthorID": "7203006933", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England, National Infection Service"}, "7003631616": {"Name": "Fry N.K.", "AuthorID": "7003631616", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England, National Infection Service"}, "57193506327": {"Name": "Atkin S.", "AuthorID": "57193506327", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60000733", "AffiliationName": "North West London Health Protection Team, Public Health England"}, "57193503149": {"Name": "Shah V.", "AuthorID": "57193503149", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60000733", "AffiliationName": "North West London Health Protection Team, Public Health England"}}}
