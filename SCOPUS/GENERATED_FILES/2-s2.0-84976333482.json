Material and Methods: 3D mass models and microcalcification clusters were simulated into ROIs of for processing mammograms. Randomly selected ROIs were subdivided in three groups according to their background glandularity: high (>30%), medium (15-30%) and low (<15%). 6 non-spiculated masses (9 - 11mm), 6 spiculated masses (5 - 7mm) and 6 microcalcification clusters (2 - 4mm) were scaled in 3D to create a range of sizes. The linear attenuation coefficient (AC) of the masses was adjusted from 100% glandular tissue to 90%, 80%, 70%, to create different contrasts. Six physicists read the full database on Barco's Coronis Uniti monitor for four different luminance levels (300, 800, 1000 and 1200 Cd/m2), using a 4-AFC tool. Percentage correct (PC) and time were computed for all different conditions. A paired t-test was performed to evaluate the effect of luminance on PC and time. A multi-factorial analysis was performed using MANOVA. Results: Paired t-test indicated a statistically significant difference for the average time per session between 300 and 1200; 800 and 1200; 1000 and 1200 Cd/m2, for all participants combined. There was no effect on PC. MANOVA denoted significantly lower reading times for high glandularity images at 1200 Cd/m2. Both types of masses were significantly faster detected at 1200 Cd/m2, for the contrast study. In the size study, microcalcification clusters and spiculated masses had a significantly higher detection rate at 1200 Cd/m2. Conclusion: These results demonstrate a significant decrease in reading time, while detectability remained constant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D digital mammography", "3D lesions", "4-AFC", "Detectability", "Detectability rate", "Human observer", "Luminance level", "Simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D lesions", "4-AFC", "Detectability", "Digital mammography", "Human observers", "Luminance levels", "Simulation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976333482", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56258145400": {"Name": "Bemelmans F.", "AuthorID": "56258145400", "AffiliationID": "60121202, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven"}, "55201317000": {"Name": "Rashidnasab A.", "AuthorID": "55201317000", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL Hospital"}, "57189853035": {"Name": "Chesterman F.", "AuthorID": "57189853035", "AffiliationID": "60082485", "AffiliationName": "Barco"}, "57203007659": {"Name": "Kimpe T.", "AuthorID": "57203007659", "AffiliationID": "60082485", "AffiliationName": "Barco"}, "57201814910": {"Name": "Bosmans H.", "AuthorID": "57201814910", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Radiology, UZ Leuven"}}}
