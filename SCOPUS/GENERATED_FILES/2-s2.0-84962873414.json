Aim To assess health conditions detected by a comprehensive PHE in professional male football players and evaluate their consequences for participation clearance. Methods A total of 558 professional football players in Qatar completed a PHE prior to the 2013 or 2014 seasons: history, general medical (including blood test), cardiovascular (12-lead ECG and echocardiography) and a musculoskeletal examination, including a specific test battery targeting lower extremity strength and flexibility. On the basis of the PHE, players were either cleared or not cleared for participation. Results In 533 players (95.5%), at least one health condition was detected requiring treatment or follow-up. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (\u226430 ng/mL) was the most common medical condition (n=499, 89.4%), followed by hepatitis B non-immunity or infection (n=164, 29.4%). Cardiac screening identified 48 players (8.6%) with one or more abnormal findings (ECG (n=19, 3.4%) and echocardiography (n=14, 2.5%)). Musculoskeletal conditions were observed in 180 players (32.3%); injuries to or strength deficits of the hip/groin and thigh accounted for the largest proportion. Medical clearance was temporarily not given in 69 players (12.4%), while further examinations were being conducted. One player was disqualified from competitive football. Conclusions PHE revealed a high prevalence of health conditions requiring treatment or follow-up in professional footballers; however, only 12.4% of conditions impacted on final clearance for participation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Football", "Health promotion", "Injury prevention", "Prevention", "Sports medicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Athletes", "Echocardiography", "Electrocardiography", "Health Status", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Musculoskeletal Diseases", "Physical Examination", "Prevalence", "Qatar", "Risk Factors", "Soccer", "Sports Medicine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962873414", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"54388610800": {"Name": "Bakken A.", "AuthorID": "54388610800", "AffiliationID": "60004030", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Medicine, Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences"}, "20136126300": {"Name": "Targett S.", "AuthorID": "20136126300", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Department of Sports Medicine"}, "37023961800": {"Name": "Bere T.", "AuthorID": "37023961800", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Oslo University Hospital"}, "57188761188": {"Name": "Adamuz M.", "AuthorID": "57188761188", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Department of Sports Medicine"}, "6701836850": {"Name": "Tol J.", "AuthorID": "6701836850", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Center of Evidence Based Sports Medicine, Academic Medical Center"}, "16044158000": {"Name": "Whiteley R.", "AuthorID": "16044158000", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Department of Sports Medicine"}, "25825824400": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "25825824400", "AffiliationID": "60022193", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Canberra"}, "7004118065": {"Name": "Witvrouw E.", "AuthorID": "7004118065", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Department of Sports Medicine"}, "7403177580": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "7403177580", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Department of Sports Medicine"}, "7102647460": {"Name": "Bahr R.", "AuthorID": "7102647460", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Center for Mobility and Hip Health, University of British Columbia"}}}
