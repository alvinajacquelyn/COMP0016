Comparatively, less attention has been paid to the study of variability, which, however, has been argued as equally important as regularities, since variability identifies diversity. In a transport network, variability exists from person to person, from place to place, and from day to day. In this paper, we present a set of measuring of variability at individual and aggregated levels using multi-day smart-card data. Statistical analysis, correlation matrix and network-based clustering methods are applied and potential use of measured results for urban applications are also discussed. We take Singapore as a case study and use one-week smart-card data for analysis. An interesting finding is that though the number of trips and mobility patterns varies from day to day, the overall spatial structure of urban movement always remains the same throughout a week. This finding showed that a systemic framework with well-organized analytical methods is indeed, necessary for extracting variability that may change at different levels and consequently for uncovering different aspects of dynamics, namely transit, social and urban dynamics. We consider this paper as a tentative work toward such generic framework for measuring variability and it can be used as a reference for other research work in such a direction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clustering", "Network", "Smart-card data", "Spatial analysis", "Variability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clustering", "Correlation matrix", "Generic frameworks", "Spatial analysis", "Systemic frameworks", "Transport networks", "Urban applications", "Variability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930207033", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"55320464800": {"Name": "Zhong C.", "AuthorID": "55320464800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Future Cities Laboratory, Architecture Department, ETH Zurich"}, "55436850500": {"Name": "Manley E.", "AuthorID": "55436850500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "7005713858": {"Name": "Batty M.", "AuthorID": "7005713858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "23479313300": {"Name": "M\u00fcller Arisona S.", "AuthorID": "23479313300", "AffiliationID": "112393364", "AffiliationName": "Institute of 4D Technologies, FHNW"}, "7201774797": {"Name": "Schmitt G.", "AuthorID": "7201774797", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Future Cities Laboratory, Architecture Department, ETH Zurich"}}}
