Increasing the dielectric constant of semiconducting polymers may close the performance gap between inorganic and organic solar cell devices. Here, a dielectric constant of 16.7 is reported for a DPP-based low bandgap polymer DT-PDPP2T-TT and 7 for its 1:3 blend with [60]PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) using frequency and voltage dependent capacitance and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) techniques. The charge mobility within the blend device (1.8 \u00d7 10-3 cm2 V-1 s-1) is found to be among the highest reported by CELIV. Bimolecular recombination and charge carrier lifetime in efficient photovoltaic devices are measured and compared to poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PCBM (1:1 w/w) and poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b\u2032]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT):PCBM (1:2 w/w) devices. When normalized to mobility, the bimolecular recombination coefficient in DT-PDPP2T-TT:PCBM is a factor of 2 lower than in P3HT:PCBM and an order of magnitude lower than in PCPDTBT:PCBM. The recombination mechanism is found to be close to diffusion-controlled Langevin recombination. The reduced recombination is explained by a smaller Coulomb capture radius, which, together with higher charge mobility, leads to efficient charge extraction in photovoltaic devices with large active layer thicknesses approaching 300 nm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["2 ,1 ,3-Benzothiadiazole", "Bimolecular recombination", "Bimolecular recombination coefficient", "High dielectric constants", "Langevin recombination", "Recombination mechanisms", "Voltage-dependent capacitances", "[6 ,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964507432", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57211682058": {"Name": "Zhang G.", "AuthorID": "57211682058", "AffiliationID": "60011664, 60189126", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, University of Wollongong"}, "8557588100": {"Name": "Mozer A.J.", "AuthorID": "8557588100", "AffiliationID": "60011664, 60189126", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, University of Wollongong"}, "7202914994": {"Name": "Clarke T.M.", "AuthorID": "7202914994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
