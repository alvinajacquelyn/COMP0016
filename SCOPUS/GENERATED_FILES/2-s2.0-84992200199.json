Although they show promise as low-powered, sensitive, and affordable monitoring devices, cross-sensitivity of functionalized carbon nanotubes to water vapor often obscures the detection of target molecules. This is a barrier to adoption for monitoring of airborne pollutants because of the varying humidity levels found in real world environments. Zeolites, also known as molecular sieves because of their selective adsorption properties, are used in this work to control the cross-sensitivity of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based sensors to water vapor. Zeolites incorporated into the sensing layer are found to reduce interference effects that would otherwise obscure the identification of NO2 gas, permitting repeatable detection over a range of relative humidities. This significant improvement is found to depend on the arrangement of the SWCNT-zeolite layers in the sensing device, as well as the hydrophilicity of the chosen zeolite.", "AuthorKeywords": ["environmental monitoring", "gas sensor", "humidity", "molecular sieve", "nanotube network", "nitrogen dioxide", "single-walled carbon nanotubes", "zeolite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental Monitoring", "Environmental pollutants", "Functionalized carbon nanotubes", "Nanotube networks", "Nitrogen dioxides", "Real world environments", "Selective adsorption", "Singlewalled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992200199", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56394959300": {"Name": "Evans G.P.", "AuthorID": "56394959300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "55225922100": {"Name": "Buckley D.J.", "AuthorID": "55225922100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55710774200": {"Name": "Adedigba A.L.", "AuthorID": "55710774200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003890182": {"Name": "Skipper N.T.", "AuthorID": "7003890182", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}}}
