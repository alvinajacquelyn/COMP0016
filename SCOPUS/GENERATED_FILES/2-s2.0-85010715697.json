However, in the event of pipeline rupture an enormous mass of CO2may be released very rapidly, presenting several risks to the pipeline and surrounding population including the significantly increased risk of brittle fracture in the pipe wall. The study of pressure variation and phase change in CO2during pipeline blowdown can contribute to the understanding of fracture initiation and propagation, as well as downstream CO2diffusion behavior. As part of the CO2QUEST project, a reusable, industrial scale pipeline experimental apparatus with a total length of 258 m and the inner diameter of 233 mm was fabricated to study pure CO2pipeline blowdown. A dual-disc blasting device was used to remotely control the opening of the pipeline. The instantaneous pressure response following release was measured with high frequency pressure transducers. Variation in fluid temperature at the top and bottom of pipeline was also recorded. Six groups of pure CO2pipeline release experiments were conducted with initially gaseous and dense phase inventories with three orifice diameters (15 mm, 50 mm and Full Bore Rupture). The typical waveform characteristics of pressure responses accompanying by the process of phase transitions in gaseous and dense CO2leakage were observed during the release as results of the propagation of a series of expansion waves. The complicated phase transitions were obtained during depressurization of gaseous and dense CO2releases. The gas-solid phase or gas-liquid-solid phase appeared when the pressure was below the triple point during the dense CO2release.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CO2release", "Large-scale pipeline blowdown", "Phase transition", "Pressure response"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blow down", "Carbon capture and storages (CCS)", "CO2release", "Experimental apparatus", "Instantaneous pressures", "Pipe-line transportations", "Pressure response", "Waveform characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010715697", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56970002600": {"Name": "Guo X.", "AuthorID": "56970002600", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57220920094": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "57220920094", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "8681462700": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "8681462700", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57193093797": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57193093797", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55922447000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55922447000", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}, "23033795700": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "23033795700", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}, "7003505415": {"Name": "Mahgerefteh H.", "AuthorID": "7003505415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "26531554000": {"Name": "Martynov S.", "AuthorID": "26531554000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57189701532": {"Name": "Collard A.", "AuthorID": "57189701532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
