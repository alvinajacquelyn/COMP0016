Design and Setting A prospective cohort study of British civil servants who responded to a self-administered questionnaire in middle-age and at older ages, 21 years later. Participants The study sample consisted of 3,939 Whitehall II Study participants (2,789 men, 1,150 women; mean age 67.6 years at follow-up) who were employed at baseline and retired at follow-up. Measurements Midlife adversity was assessed by self-reported socioeconomic adversity (low occupational position; poor standard of living) and psychosocial adversity (high job strain; few close relationships). Symptoms of depression post-retirement were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Results After adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related covariates at baseline and follow-up, there were strong associations between midlife adversities and post-retirement depressive symptoms: low occupational position (odds ratio [OR]: 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.51), poor standard of living (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.66-3.39), high job strain (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.09-2.14), and few close relationships (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.12-2.03). The strength of the associations between socioeconomic, psychosocial, work-related, or non-work related exposures and depressive symptoms was similar. Conclusions Robust associations from observational data suggest that several socioeconomic and psychosocial risk factors for symptoms of depression post-retirement can be detected already in midlife.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "elderly", "inequalities", "life course", "mood disorders", "old age", "prospective", "stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Depression", "Employment", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retirement", "Risk Factors", "Social Class", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928053326", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35239241500": {"Name": "Virtanen M.", "AuthorID": "35239241500", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Turku, Turku University Hospital"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1018, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioral Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "55045633300": {"Name": "Ferrie J.", "AuthorID": "55045633300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Community and Social Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7003614400": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "7003614400", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioral Sciences, University of Helsinki"}}}
