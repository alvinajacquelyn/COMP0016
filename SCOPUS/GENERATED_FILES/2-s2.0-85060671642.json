There is high inter-individual variability in the manifestations of human neuropathic pain, which largely depends on personality traits. We aim to identify the influence of different behavioral traits in the inter-individual vulnerability to neuropathic pain manifestations using behavioral, electrophysiological and genetic approaches. We first selected mice with extreme social and emotional traits and look for correlation with the spontaneous neuronal activity in the central amygdala. Neuropathic pain was induced to these mice to evaluate the influence of behavioral traits on nociceptive manifestations and gene expression profiles in the amygdala. Our results show an association of the spontaneous central amygdala neuronal activity with the sociability behavior. We demonstrate that low sociable, high anxious and low depressive phenotypes develop enhanced nociceptive hypersensitivity after nerve injury. However, greater emotional alterations and cognitive impairment are observed in high sociable, anxious-like and depressive-like mice, indicating that nociceptive, emotional and cognitive manifestations of neuropathic pain do not correlate with each other. Gene analyses identify high Pdyn and Il6 levels in the amygdala as indicative of enhanced nociceptive hypersensitivity and reveal an association between high Gadd45 expression and attenuated emotional and cognitive manifestations of neuropathic pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amygdala", "Anxiety", "Behavioral traits", "Depression", "Neuropathic pain", "Sociability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Central Amygdaloid Nucleus", "Cognition", "Emotions", "Enkephalins", "Gene Expression", "Individuality", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Mice", "Neuralgia", "Nociceptive Pain", "Protein Precursors", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060671642", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57204844037": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Navarro M.", "AuthorID": "57204844037", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "36608271600": {"Name": "Lara-Mayorga I.", "AuthorID": "36608271600", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "28267948600": {"Name": "Negrete R.", "AuthorID": "28267948600", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "7005805890": {"Name": "Ba\u00f1os J.", "AuthorID": "7005805890", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "26643254500": {"Name": "Maldonado R.", "AuthorID": "26643254500", "AffiliationID": "60023506, 60000100", "AffiliationName": "IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute)"}, "8236003000": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves L.", "AuthorID": "8236003000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College"}, "7101706308": {"Name": "Dickenson A.", "AuthorID": "7101706308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College"}, "6603220981": {"Name": "Bilecki W.", "AuthorID": "6603220981", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuropharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow"}, "8362592700": {"Name": "Wawrzczak-Bargie\u0142a A.", "AuthorID": "8362592700", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuropharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow"}, "7006034658": {"Name": "Przew\u0142ocki R.", "AuthorID": "7006034658", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuropharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow"}}}
