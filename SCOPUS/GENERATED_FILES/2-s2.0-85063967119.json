The current standard intervention for vault prolapse is a mesh sacrocolpopexy or sacrohysteropexy. However, patients and surgeons are increasingly hesitant to use mesh given recent the UK and Food and Drug Administration warnings and litigation. A possible alternative is to use autologous tissue to support the vault, as a mesh-free solution. We report the outcomes from an initial series of autologous rectus fascia sheath (RFS) sacrocolpopexy and sacrohysteropexy in patients with complex pelvic floor dysfunction. Patients and Methods: All patients had previous, multiple urological/gynecological surgery and declined standard mesh repairs. All had preoperative videourodynamics and defecating magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. The autologous POP repair was performed using 10-18 cm of rectus sheath with a similar technique to that employing mesh to support the anterior-posterior vaginal walls or encircle the cervix and secured to the sacral promontory. Results: Seven patients with a mean age of 52 (33-64) years underwent autologous RFS POP repair between 2014 and 2017. Mean follow-up is 16 (range 2-33) months. All patients have durable result at last follow-up. No significant complications are reported. Conclusions: This is the first report of patients with complex pelvic floor dysfunction and apical POP being managed with autologous RFS sacrocolpopexy/sacrohysteropexy, and only the second report of a free graft being utilized with success. Autologous RFS sacrocolpopexy/sacrohysteropexy avoids the 10%-15% risks of mesh-related complications. Further studies of long-term durability are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Prolapse", "sacrocolpopexy", "sacrohysteropexy", "vaginal mesh"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063967119", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"46062438500": {"Name": "Seth J.", "AuthorID": "46062438500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57208150576": {"Name": "Toia B.", "AuthorID": "57208150576", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "56200242300": {"Name": "Ecclestone H.", "AuthorID": "56200242300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "55851940397": {"Name": "Hamid R.", "AuthorID": "55851940397", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "6506281538": {"Name": "Ockrim J.", "AuthorID": "6506281538", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}}}
