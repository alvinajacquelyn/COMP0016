All rights reserved.Will energy storage in Japan be an important aspect of a future energy system where renewable generation makes up a large proportion of a country's energy supply? The chapter examines the barriers to storage development and takes three examples that have taken different, but successful, approaches to the development of storage. Some clear common issues emerge between successful countries: the need for a clear strategic framework; the need to support development with a demonstration that encourages early commercialization of storage technologies; and the opening up of markets to allow storage operators to capture all of the value delivered to the grid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy storage (Germany)", "Energy storage (Japan)", "Energy storage (USA)", "Worldwide energy storage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy supplies", "Future energies", "Renewable generation", "Storage technology", "Strategic frameworks"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979974286", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56118125800": {"Name": "Sweetnam T.", "AuthorID": "56118125800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
