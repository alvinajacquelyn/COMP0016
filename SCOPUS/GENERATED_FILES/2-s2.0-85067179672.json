Currently, the safety management method to limit the force that a US robot can apply mostly relies on force sensing and software-based algorithms. This causes the concern that the potential failure of sensors, electrical systems, or software could lead to patient injuries. In this paper, we investigated a customized spring-loaded ball clutch joint designed for a newly developed US robot to passively limit the force applied. The working mechanism of the clutch was modelled and the kinematic-based analysis was performed to understand the variation of the limited force at different postures of the robot. The triggering torque of the clutch was found to be 3928 N\u00b7mm, which results in the mean limited force 22.10 \u00b1 1.76 N at the US probe end based on potential postures. The real measurement of the implemented design indicated that the limited force could be set between 17 and 24 N at the neutral posture depending on the preload. With the maximum preload, the mean limited force was found to be 21.98 \u00b1 0.96 N based on 30 repeated measurements. The practically measured results meet the expectation from the theoretical calculation, and the resulting small variation has indicated a good repeatability of the clutch. Based on this evidence, it is concluded that the proposed clutch meets the design aim that it can limit the force applied within a safe range while at the same time ensuring that the required force is applied at different postures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ball clutch", "Force control", "Mechanism design", "Robot safety", "Ultrasound robot"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067179672", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57190987771": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57190987771", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "15042114800": {"Name": "Housden R.J.", "AuthorID": "15042114800", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "56637802700": {"Name": "Noh Y.", "AuthorID": "56637802700", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "57205933336": {"Name": "Hajnal J.", "AuthorID": "57205933336", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "9245867600": {"Name": "Rhode K.", "AuthorID": "9245867600", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "57205465825": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57205465825", "AffiliationID": "60170137", "AffiliationName": "Xtronics Ltd."}, "57209912238": {"Name": "Singh D.", "AuthorID": "57209912238", "AffiliationID": "60170137", "AffiliationName": "Xtronics Ltd."}, "56741222700": {"Name": "Lindenroth L.", "AuthorID": "56741222700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Engineering, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
