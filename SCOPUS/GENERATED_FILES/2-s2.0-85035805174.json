In the absence of verbal report, these nociceptive responses are used as measures of pain sensation in newborn humans, as they are in animals [3, 4]. However, many infants are raised in a physiologically stressful environment, and little is known about the effect of background levels of stress upon their pain responses. In adults, acute physiological stress causes hyperalgesia [5\u20137], and increased background stress increases pain [8\u201310], but these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to infants. Here we have simultaneously measured nociceptive behavior, brain activity, and levels of physiological stress in a sample of 56 newborn human infants aged 36\u201342 weeks. Salivary cortisol (hypothalamic pituitary axis), heart rate variability (sympathetic adrenal medullary system), EEG event-related potentials (nociceptive cortical activity), and facial expression (behavior) were acquired in individual infants following a clinically required heel lance. We show that infants with higher levels of stress exhibit larger amplitude cortical nociceptive responses, but this is not reflected in their behavior. Furthermore, while nociceptive behavior and cortical activity are normally correlated, this relationship is disrupted in infants with high levels of physiological stress. Brain activity evoked by noxious stimulation is therefore enhanced by stress, but this cannot be deduced from observation of pain behavior. This may be important in the prevention of adverse effects of early repetitive pain on brain development. Jones et al. show that high physiological stress in infants, measured by cortisol and heart rate variability, is associated with greater cortical pain activity, but not with increased pain behavior. Stress disrupts the relationship between nociceptive brain activity and behavior and is an important extraneous factor when predicting infant pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cortex", "cortisol", "development", "EEG", "event related potential", "facial expression", "heart rate variability", "neonatal", "nociception", "pain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nociception", "Saliva", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035805174", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57197867290": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "57197867290", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57203193780": {"Name": "Fabrizi L.", "AuthorID": "57203193780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57197872601": {"Name": "Laudiano-Dray M.", "AuthorID": "57197872601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "37121242300": {"Name": "Whitehead K.", "AuthorID": "37121242300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "14820085500": {"Name": "Verriotis M.", "AuthorID": "14820085500", "AffiliationID": "118758669", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Program"}, "7402773525": {"Name": "Fitzgerald M.", "AuthorID": "7402773525", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102666483": {"Name": "Meek J.", "AuthorID": "7102666483", "AffiliationID": "60084905, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Obstetric Wing, University College London Hospitals"}}}
