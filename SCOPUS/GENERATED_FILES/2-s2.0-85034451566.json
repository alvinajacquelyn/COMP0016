Method: A discrete choice experiment survey with a two-alternative study design was developed. Data were collected from pediatric specialist outpatient clinics from 482 mothers with daughters aged between 8 and 17 years. Preferences of the four attributes of HPV vaccines (protection against cervical cancer, protection duration, side effects, and out-of-pocket costs) were evaluated. The marginal and overall WTP were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. A subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the impact of socioeconomic factors on mothers\u2019 WTP. Results: Side effects, protection against cervical cancer, protection duration, and out-of-pocket cost determined the decision to receive or not receive the vaccine. All attributes had a statistically significant effect on the preference of and the WTP for the vaccine. Maximum WTP for ideal vaccines (i.e., 100% protection, lifetime protection duration, and 0% side effects) was HK$8976 (US $1129). The estimated WTP for vaccines currently available was HK$1620 (US $208), lower than the current market price. Among those who had a monthly household income of more than HK$100,000 (US $12,821), the WTP for vaccines currently offered was higher than the market price. Conclusions: This study provides new data on how features of the HPV vaccine are viewed and valued by mothers by determining their perception of ideal or improved and current vaccine technologies. These findings could contribute to future policies on the improvement of HPV vaccine and be useful for the immunization service in Hong Kong.", "AuthorKeywords": ["discrete choice experiment", "HPV", "vaccination", "willingness to pay"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Choice Behavior", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hong Kong", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Mothers", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Papillomavirus Vaccines", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034451566", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57192409955": {"Name": "Wong C.", "AuthorID": "57192409955", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, The University of Hong Kong"}, "55883514900": {"Name": "Man K.", "AuthorID": "55883514900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Pok Fu Lam, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7003622681": {"Name": "Ip P.", "AuthorID": "7003622681", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Pok Fu Lam, The University of Hong Kong"}, "36860235300": {"Name": "Kwan M.", "AuthorID": "36860235300", "AffiliationID": "60013108", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital"}, "7003288588": {"Name": "McGhee S.", "AuthorID": "7003288588", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam"}}}
