Because of the current insufficient knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development and progression of respiratory diseases, treatment options remain limited. To overcome this limitation and understand the associated molecular changes, noninvasive imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have been explored for biomarker development, with 18F-FDG PET imaging being the most studied. The quantification of pulmonary molecular imaging data remains challenging because of variations in tissue, air, blood, and water fractions within the lungs. The proportions of these components further differ depending on the lung disease. Therefore, different quantification approaches have been proposed to address these variabilities. However, no standardized approach has been developed to date. This article reviews the data evaluating 18F-FDG PET quantification approaches in lung diseases, focusing on methods to account for variations in lung components and the interpretation of the derived parameters. The diseases reviewed include acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Based on review of prior literature, ongoing research, and discussions among the authors, suggested considerations are presented to assist with the interpretation of the derived parameters from these approaches and the design of future studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lung inflammation", "Molecular imaging", "Positron emission tomography", "Pulmonary"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Lung", "Lung Diseases", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reproducibility of Results", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011977714", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7405454324": {"Name": "Chen D.L.", "AuthorID": "7405454324", "AffiliationID": "60006263, 60022756", "AffiliationName": "Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "56594723500": {"Name": "Cheriyan J.", "AuthorID": "56594723500", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006017543": {"Name": "Chilvers E.R.", "AuthorID": "7006017543", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55914892200": {"Name": "Fisk M.", "AuthorID": "55914892200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57193236073": {"Name": "Vass L.", "AuthorID": "57193236073", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55208035400": {"Name": "Wilkinson I.", "AuthorID": "55208035400", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36508497700": {"Name": "Choudhury G.", "AuthorID": "36508497700", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "23484719600": {"Name": "Connell M.", "AuthorID": "23484719600", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005733436": {"Name": "MacNee W.", "AuthorID": "7005733436", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57190702184": {"Name": "Van Beek E.J.R.", "AuthorID": "57190702184", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "22633329800": {"Name": "Coello C.", "AuthorID": "22633329800", "AffiliationID": "60109255", "AffiliationName": "Imanova Ltd."}, "7101894687": {"Name": "Gunn R.N.", "AuthorID": "7101894687", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "56825342200": {"Name": "Holman B.F.", "AuthorID": "56825342200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7005479075": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "7005479075", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57193237117": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57193237117", "AffiliationID": "100882896", "AffiliationName": "Medical Image Analysis Consultant"}, "7103136779": {"Name": "Mohan D.", "AuthorID": "7103136779", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Discovery, Respiratory Therapy Area Unit, GlaxoSmithKline R and D"}, "6603373403": {"Name": "Tal-Singer R.", "AuthorID": "6603373403", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Discovery, Respiratory Therapy Area Unit, GlaxoSmithKline R and D"}, "7006692488": {"Name": "Parr D.", "AuthorID": "7006692488", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire"}, "55376750700": {"Name": "Subramanian D.", "AuthorID": "55376750700", "AffiliationID": "60172309", "AffiliationName": "Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36819584300": {"Name": "Wellen J.W.", "AuthorID": "36819584300", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Worldwide Research and Development, Pfizer, Inc."}, "55389720000": {"Name": "Wilson F.J.", "AuthorID": "55389720000", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Medicine Imaging, GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
