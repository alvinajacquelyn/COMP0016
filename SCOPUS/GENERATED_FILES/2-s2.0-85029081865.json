In this paper, we estimate Tibet's energy consumption using limited online documents, and we calculate the 2014 energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions of Tibet and its seven prefecture-level administrative divisions for the first time. Our results show that 5.52 million tons of CO2 were emitted in Tibet in 2014; 33% of these emissions are associated with cement production. Tibet's emissions per capita amounted to 1.74 tons in 2014, which is substantially lower than the national average, although Tibet's emission intensity is relatively high at 0.60 tons per thousand yuan in 2014. Among Tibet's seven prefecture-level administrative divisions, Lhasa City and Shannan Region are the two largest CO2 contributors and have the highest per capita emissions and emission intensities. The Nagqu and Nyingchi regions emit little CO2 due to their farming/pasturing-dominated economies. This quantitative measure of Tibet's regional CO2 emissions provides solid data support for Tibet's actions on climate change and emission reductions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cities", "CO2 emisions", "Energy Consumption", "Tibet"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029081865", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"56015318000": {"Name": "Shan Y.", "AuthorID": "56015318000", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "54411744100": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "54411744100", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "36515607400": {"Name": "Schroeder H.", "AuthorID": "36515607400", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "56603418200": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "56603418200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Science, University of East Anglia"}, "57195599048": {"Name": "Ma J.", "AuthorID": "57195599048", "AffiliationID": "60016211, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "18434662400": {"Name": "Ma Z.", "AuthorID": "18434662400", "AffiliationID": "60016211, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
