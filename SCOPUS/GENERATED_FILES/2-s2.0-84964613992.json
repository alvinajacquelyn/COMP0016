This paper highlights some practical considerations and challenges with respect to PIP submissions and paediatric clinical trials during the pharmaceutical development phase, using the FP7-funded Clonidine for Sedation of Paediatric Patients in the Intensive Care Unit (CloSed) project as a case study. Examples discussed include challenges and considerations regarding formulation development, blinding and randomisation, product labelling and shipment and clinical trial requirements versus requirements for marketing authorisation. A significant quantity of information is required for PIP submissions and it is hoped that future applicants may benefit from an insight into some critical considerations and challenges faced in the CloSed project.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials", "Clonidine", "Formulation", "Paediatric Investigation Plan", "Paediatrics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clonidine", "Double-Blind Method", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Hypnotics and Sedatives", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Pediatrics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964613992", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57205373200": {"Name": "Hanning S.M.", "AuthorID": "57205373200", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55761363900": {"Name": "Orlu Gul M.", "AuthorID": "55761363900", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56630798300": {"Name": "Winslade J.", "AuthorID": "56630798300", "AffiliationID": "114018688", "AffiliationName": "Therakind Ltd"}, "57188990332": {"Name": "Baarslag M.A.", "AuthorID": "57188990332", "AffiliationID": "60015627", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care and Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital"}, "7003774960": {"Name": "Neubert A.", "AuthorID": "7003774960", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen"}}}
