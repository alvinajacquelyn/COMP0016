A nexus between what? Over what scales? And what are the consequences of such a nexus? This article analyses why readers should care about the nexus concept in relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We discuss a five-nodes definition and propose perspectives that may lead to a reload of climate policy with buy-in from supply-chain managers and resource-rich developing countries. Our research perspectives address modelling approaches and scenarios at the interface of bio-physical inputs and the human dimensions of security and governance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Climate policy", "Human dimensions", "Resource-Rich", "United Nations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058663784", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"6603227818": {"Name": "Bleischwitz R.", "AuthorID": "6603227818", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "6506267137": {"Name": "VanDeveer S.D.", "AuthorID": "6506267137", "AffiliationID": "60024063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Conflict Resolution, Human Security, and Global Governance, University of Massachusetts Boston"}, "6603640566": {"Name": "Obersteiner M.", "AuthorID": "6603640566", "AffiliationID": "60019497", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis"}, "6603760808": {"Name": "van der Voet E.", "AuthorID": "6603760808", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University, Institute of Environmental Sciences CML"}, "8403165600": {"Name": "Johnson C.", "AuthorID": "8403165600", "AffiliationID": "60018474", "AffiliationName": "UNC Greensboro, Department of Geography, Environment, and Sustainability"}, "6602440268": {"Name": "Andrews-Speed P.", "AuthorID": "6602440268", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "National University of Singapore, Energy Studies Institute"}, "6506716912": {"Name": "Boersma T.", "AuthorID": "6506716912", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University, SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy"}, "7102907897": {"Name": "Hoff H.", "AuthorID": "7102907897", "AffiliationID": "60025182", "AffiliationName": "Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"}, "7003501910": {"Name": "van Vuuren D.P.", "AuthorID": "7003501910", "AffiliationID": "60018815, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University, Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development"}}}
