Inparticular, we focus our attention on the spatial Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, as it constitutes anemblematic example of a game whose Nash equilibrium is defection. Previous investigationsshowed that, under opportune conditions, it is possible to reach, in the evolutionaryPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma, an equilibrium of cooperation. Notably, it seems that mechanisms likemotion may lead a population to become cooperative. In the proposed model, we map agentsto particles of a gas so that, on varying the system temperature, they randomly move. Indoing so, we are able to identify a relation between the temperature and the finalequilibrium of the population, explaining how it is possible to break the classical Nashequilibrium in the spatial Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma when considering agents able to increasetheir payoff over time. Moreover, we introduce a formalism to study order-disorder phasetransitions in these dynamics. As result, we highlight that the proposed model allows toexplain analytically how a population, whose interactions are based on the Prisoner\u2019sDilemma, can reach an equilibrium far from the expected one; opening also the way todefine a direct link between evolutionary game theory and statistical physics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct links", "Evolutionary game theory", "Memory aware", "Nash equilibria", "Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "Statistical physics", "System temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958552375", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55601598500": {"Name": "Javarone M.A.", "AuthorID": "55601598500", "AffiliationID": "60010110", "AffiliationName": "DUMAS \u2013 Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Sassari"}}}
