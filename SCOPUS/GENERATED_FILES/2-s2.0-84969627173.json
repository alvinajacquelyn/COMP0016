The transcriptional activity of steroid receptors, including AR, is dependent on interactions with the HSP90 chaperone machinery, but it is unclear whether HSP90 modulates the activity or expression of AR variants. Here, we investigated the effects of HSP90 inhibition on AR-V7 in prostate cancer cell lines endogenously expressing this variant. We demonstrate that AR-V7 and full-length AR (AR-FL) were depleted upon inhibition of HSP90. However, the mechanisms underlying AR-V7 depletion differed from those for AR-FL. Whereas HSP90 inhibition destabilized AR-FL and induced its proteasomal degradation, AR-V7 protein exhibited higher stability than AR-FL and did not require HSP90 chaperone activity. Instead, HSP90 inhibition resulted in the reduction of AR-V7 mRNAlevels but did not affect total AR transcript levels, indicating that HSP90 inhibition disrupted AR-V7 splicing. Bioinformatic analyses of transcriptome- wide RNA sequencing data confirmed that the secondgeneration HSP90 inhibitor onalespib altered the splicing of at least 557 genes in prostate cancer cells, including AR. These findings indicate that the effects of HSP90 inhibition on mRNA splicing may prove beneficial in prostate cancers expressing ARV7, supporting further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors in malignancies no longer responsive to androgen deprivation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Benzamides", "Blotting, Western", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Immunoprecipitation", "Isoindoles", "Male", "Mice", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Receptors, Androgen", "RNA Splicing", "RNA, Messenger", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969627173", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"8608957100": {"Name": "Ferraldeschi R.", "AuthorID": "8608957100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Targeted Therapies Group, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36821684700": {"Name": "Welti J.", "AuthorID": "36821684700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "15842089000": {"Name": "Powers M.V.", "AuthorID": "15842089000", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57199426817": {"Name": "Yuan W.", "AuthorID": "57199426817", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55771434100": {"Name": "Seed G.", "AuthorID": "55771434100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "26635975400": {"Name": "Riisnaes R.", "AuthorID": "26635975400", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57189352121": {"Name": "Hedayat S.", "AuthorID": "57189352121", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57189353436": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57189353436", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7101745100": {"Name": "Crespo M.", "AuthorID": "7101745100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "54785293000": {"Name": "Rodrigues D.N.", "AuthorID": "54785293000", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55538443000": {"Name": "Figueiredo I.", "AuthorID": "55538443000", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55141006200": {"Name": "Miranda S.", "AuthorID": "55141006200", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6602425583": {"Name": "Carreira S.", "AuthorID": "6602425583", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7102934763": {"Name": "Sharp S.", "AuthorID": "7102934763", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "9740870900": {"Name": "Attard G.", "AuthorID": "9740870900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Targeted Therapies Group, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102917811": {"Name": "Workman P.", "AuthorID": "7102917811", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies and Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7003906526": {"Name": "De Bono J.S.", "AuthorID": "7003906526", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Targeted Therapies Group, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36480551700": {"Name": "Smyth T.", "AuthorID": "36480551700", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Pharmaceuticals"}, "7202033279": {"Name": "Lyons J.F.", "AuthorID": "7202033279", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Pharmaceuticals"}, "7003374004": {"Name": "Wallis N.", "AuthorID": "7003374004", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Pharmaceuticals"}, "35478462900": {"Name": "Plymate S.R.", "AuthorID": "35478462900", "AffiliationID": "60028548, 60031866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of Washington School of Medicine, GRECC, VAPSHCS"}}}
