The material is both highly rough and intrinsically hydrophobic, resulting in superhydrophobic membranes which show a substantial affinity for hydrophobic solvents and oils. The membranes are syringe-mounted, suction pressure is applied and the selective collection of oil is achieved. The membranes are extremely robust, which is a result of the zeolitic roughening process, they possess small pores (0.7 \u03bcm), as a result these devices can perform complete separation and operate at a range of suction pressures. The devices could be readily used in a range of real-world applications, including oil spill clean-up and industrial filters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["filter", "oil", "superhydrophobic", "surface functionalization", "water purification", "water separation", "zeolite"], "IndexKeywords": ["filter", "oil", "Superhydrophobic", "Surface Functionalization", "Water purification", "Water separation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947286284", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"26028240500": {"Name": "Crick C.", "AuthorID": "26028240500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "56478592600": {"Name": "Ozkan F.", "AuthorID": "56478592600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
