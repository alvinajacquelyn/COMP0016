This study formally tested the association in a large non-clinical sample with established neurological measures of face recognition. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-seven participants completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences schizotypy scale and completed the Famous Faces Test and the Cardiff Repeated Recognition Test for Faces. Results: No association between any schizotypal dimension and performance on either of the facial recognition and learning tests was found. The null results can be accepted with a high degree of confidence. Conclusions: Further additional evidence is provided for a lack of association between schizotypy and basic face recognition deficits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affect", "Face recognition", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "Schizotypy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Schizotypal Personality Disorder", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945197123", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7007065687": {"Name": "Bell V.", "AuthorID": "7007065687", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7006107064": {"Name": "Halligan P.", "AuthorID": "7006107064", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}}}
