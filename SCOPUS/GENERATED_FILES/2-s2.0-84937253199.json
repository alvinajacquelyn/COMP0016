Once the excessive comovement is subtracted from individual financial time series, the behaviour of real and financial returns is virtually identical in both the cross-sectional and time series domains, thereby demonstrating the inherently collective nature of excessive fluctuations. Put differently, if excess volatility is to be reduced, then one would do well to inhibit excess comovement first. At any rate, the excessive behaviour in volatility and comovement should no longer be studied in isolation of each other.", "AuthorKeywords": ["excess comovement", "excess volatility", "profit rate", "random matrix theory", "return on assets"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937253199", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"35366644500": {"Name": "Livan G.", "AuthorID": "35366644500", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}, "56000032000": {"Name": "Alfarano S.", "AuthorID": "56000032000", "AffiliationID": "60002676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Universitat Jaume I"}, "12806711100": {"Name": "Milakovi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "12806711100", "AffiliationID": "60011372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Bamberg"}, "7003664476": {"Name": "Scalas E.", "AuthorID": "7003664476", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}}}
