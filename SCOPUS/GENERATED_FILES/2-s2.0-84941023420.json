In this note we investigate the line version of this result, that is, we want to find n lines in convex position in a sufficiently large set of lines that are in general position. We prove almost matching upper and lower bounds for the minimum size of the set of lines in general position that always contains n in convex position. This is quite unexpected, since in the case of points, the best known bounds are very far from each other. We also establish the dual versions of many variants and generalizations of the Erd\u0151s\u2013Szekeres theorem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convex position", "Duality", "Erd\u0151s\u2013Szekeres theorem", "Line arrangements"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941023420", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "24832268800": {"Name": "Rold\u00e1n-Pensado E.", "AuthorID": "24832268800", "AffiliationID": "60172283", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Matem\u00e1ticas, UNAM campus Juriquilla"}, "36037130800": {"Name": "T\u00f3th G.", "AuthorID": "36037130800", "AffiliationID": "60007752, 60027811", "AffiliationName": "MTA R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics"}}}
