We aimed at estimating clinical utility of a standard single-item test for case finding and screening of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder among individuals suffering from anxiety and mood disorders. Methods We recruited adults consecutively referred, in a 12-month period, to an outpatient clinic for anxiety and depressive disorders. We assessed the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) single-item test, using the Mini- International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), plus an additional item of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for craving, as reference standard to diagnose a current DSM-5 alcohol use disorder. We estimated sensitivity and specificity of the single-item test, as well as positive and negative Clinical Utility Indexes (CUIs). Results 242 subjects with anxiety and mood disorders were included. The NIAAA single-item test showed high sensitivity (91.9%) and specificity (91.2%) for DSM-5 alcohol use disorder. The positive CUI was 0.601, whereas the negative one was 0.898, with excellent values also accounting for main individual characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis, psychological distress levels, smoking status). Discussion Testing for relevant indexes, we found an excellent clinical utility of the NIAAA single-item test for screening true negative cases. Our findings support a routine use of reliable methods for rapid screening in similar mental health settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol use disorder", "Anxiety", "Comorbidity", "Depression", "DSM-5", "Dual diagnosis", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcohol-Related Disorders", "Alcoholism", "Anxiety Disorders", "Depressive Disorder", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outpatient Clinics, Hospital", "Outpatients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990044966", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55249556900": {"Name": "Bartoli F.", "AuthorID": "55249556900", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57191433783": {"Name": "Di Carlo F.", "AuthorID": "57191433783", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57191430624": {"Name": "Capuzzi E.", "AuthorID": "57191430624", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55634683100": {"Name": "Crocamo C.", "AuthorID": "55634683100", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "57191433017": {"Name": "Biagi E.", "AuthorID": "57191433017", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "6506040601": {"Name": "Colmegna F.", "AuthorID": "6506040601", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "57191428850": {"Name": "Parma F.", "AuthorID": "57191428850", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55920316000": {"Name": "Madeddu F.", "AuthorID": "55920316000", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Milano Bicocca"}}}
