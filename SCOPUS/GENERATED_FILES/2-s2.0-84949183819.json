The ultimate strength of both the hull girder and stiffened panels in an as-built post-Panamax containership is estimated using ANSYS nonlinear finite element analysis and ALPS/HULL and ALPS/ULSAP programs to clarify the adequacy of the structural safety. Finally, this paper proposes an assessment procedure for preventing an unexpected catastrophe, such as that experienced by the MSC Napoli. Such accidents, although rare, result in significant economic losses and marine pollution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MSC Napoli", "post-Panamax class containership", "progressive hull collapse", "ultimate strength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Assessment procedure", "Container ships", "MSC Napoli", "Non-linear finite-element analysis", "progressive hull collapse", "Structural failure", "Structural safety", "Ultimate strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949183819", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"53881525800": {"Name": "Koh T.", "AuthorID": "53881525800", "AffiliationID": "60093581", "AffiliationName": "Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co.
