Materials and methods: A 12-year-old girl with otherwise unremarkable medical history presented with abrupt, painless loss of vision. Over the next few months, she developed moderate sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, migraines, anhedonia and thyroiditis. Ocular examination confirmed bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Metabolic workup documented elevated cerebrospinal fluid lactate. Initial genetic analyses excluded the three most common LHON mutations. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing of the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome was performed. Results: Whole mtDNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic heteroplasmic mutation m.13046T>C in MTND5 encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I. This particular variant has previously been described in a single case report of MELAS/Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy). Based on the constellation of clinical symptoms in our patient, we diagnose the condition as LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Conclusions: We describe a unique presentation of LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome resulting from a m.13046T>C mutation in a 12-year-old girl. In patients with sudden vision loss in which three of the most prevalent LHON mitochondrial mutations have been ruled out, molecular genetic examination should be extended to other mtDNA-encoded subunits of MTND5 complex I. Furthermore, atypical clinical presentations must be considered, even in well-described phenotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["LHON", "loss of vision", "MELAS", "mitochondrial DNA", "ND5", "overlap syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Electron Transport Complex I", "Female", "Humans", "MELAS Syndrome", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Optic Atrophy, Hereditary, Leber", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Field Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958748682", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57213768112": {"Name": "Kolarova H.", "AuthorID": "57213768112", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "6602137889": {"Name": "Tesarova M.", "AuthorID": "6602137889", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "56043069900": {"Name": "Kucerova Vidrova V.", "AuthorID": "56043069900", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "6701660756": {"Name": "Hansikova H.", "AuthorID": "6701660756", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "57203614904": {"Name": "Honzik T.", "AuthorID": "57203614904", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "56165888700": {"Name": "Forgac M.", "AuthorID": "56165888700", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "7005291248": {"Name": "Zamecnik J.", "AuthorID": "7005291248", "AffiliationID": "60016605, 60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and University Hospital Motol in Prague"}}}
