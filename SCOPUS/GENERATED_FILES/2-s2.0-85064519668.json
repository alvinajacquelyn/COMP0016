In discussing both the non-statist theoretical frameworks and the practical educational experiments associated with this tradition, I suggest that it can add a valuable dimension to recent critical work in philosophy of education that draws on the republican idea of freedom as non-domination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anarchism", "Freedom", "Non-domination", "Radical education", "Republicanism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064519668", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57203671809": {"Name": "Suissa J.", "AuthorID": "57203671809", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
