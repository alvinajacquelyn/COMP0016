Methods: Affective/emotional depressive symptoms were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) depression sub-scale across phase 1 (1985-1988), phase 2 (1989-1990), and phase 3 (1991-1994) of the Whitehall II prospective cohort study; 'chronic' = depressive episode at phase 1, 2 and 3; 'new' = depressive episode at phase 3 only. Cancer incidence was obtained from the National Health Service Central Register with an average follow-up of 15.6 years (range 0.08-17.4). The study sample consisted of 6983 participants, aged 35-55 years at baseline. Results were adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic position, health behaviours, health status/conditions, medication, and social support. Results: Over a 17.4 year follow-up, chronic depressive symptoms did not increase the risk of cancer incidence compared to those who never experienced symptoms (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-1.49). Participants who experienced new depressive symptoms had an increased risk of cancer incidence in the first 9 years of follow-up (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.23-2.90) but no increased risk in later years (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.52-1.35). Conclusion: Chronic depressive symptoms were not associated with cancer incidence. In contrast, new-onset symptoms were associated with a substantially increased risk, possibly due to reverse causality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Depression", "Depressive symptoms", "Longitudinal studies", "Psycho-oncology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Behavior", "Health Status", "Humans", "Incidence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Social Support", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963749990", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57188843161": {"Name": "Archer G.", "AuthorID": "57188843161", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7202619429": {"Name": "Head J.", "AuthorID": "7202619429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
