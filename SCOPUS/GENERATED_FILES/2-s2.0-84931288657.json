Method: A total of 4,116 participants in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging provided baseline data on social network characteristics and potential confounding factors, and complete follow-up data on 2 measures of subjective well-being. Results: Social network size and network contact frequency were positively and independently associated with future life satisfaction and quality of life after controlling for confounding factors, including demographic characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and long-standing illness. In contrast, social network diversity was not independently related to future subjective well-being. Conclusion: Different aspects of people's social networks may help sustain levels of subjective well-being in older age. The role of close relationships and frequent contact in later life may be particularly important. These results highlight the need for examining different aspects of social networks for promoting well-being of older people.", "AuthorKeywords": ["English Longitudinal Study of Aging", "quality of life", "social networks", "subjective well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Personal Satisfaction", "Quality of Life", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931288657", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"15848781400": {"Name": "Rafnsson S.", "AuthorID": "15848781400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "16029356900": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "16029356900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
