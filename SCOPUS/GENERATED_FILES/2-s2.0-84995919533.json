Results of ongoing preclinical and clinical trials suggest that partial restoration of dystrophin might be sufficient to significantly reduce muscle damage. Different myogenic progenitors are candidates for cell therapy of muscular dystrophies, but only satellite cells and pericytes have already entered clinical experimentation. This study aimed to provide in vitro quantitative evidence of the ability of mesoangioblasts to restore dystrophin, in terms of protein accumulation and distribution, within myotubes derived from DMD patients, using a microengineered model. We designed an ad hoc experimental strategy to miniaturize on a chip the standard process of muscle regeneration independent of variables such as inflammation and fibrosis. It is based on the coculture, at different ratios, of human dystrophin-positive myogenic progenitors and dystrophin-negative myoblasts in a substrate with muscle-like physiological stiffness and cell micropatterns. Results showed that both healthy myoblasts and mesoangioblasts restored dystrophin expression in DMD myotubes. However, mesoangioblasts showed unexpected efficiency with respect to myoblasts in dystrophin production in terms of the amount of protein produced (40% vs. 15%) and length of the dystrophin membrane domain (210\u2013240 \u00b5m vs. 40\u201370 \u00b5m). These results show that our micro-scaled in vitro model of human DMD skeletal muscle validated previous in vivo preclinical work and may be used to predict efficacy of new methods aimed at enhancing dystrophin accumulation and distribution before they are tested in vivo, reducing time, costs, and variability of clinical experimentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cellular therapy", "Muscular dystrophy", "Pericytes", "Technology", "Tissue regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Assay", "Cell Differentiation", "Coculture Techniques", "Dystrophin", "Humans", "Microarray Analysis", "Models, Biological", "Muscle Fibers, Skeletal", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Myoblasts", "Protein Domains", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tissue Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995919533", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"24336306100": {"Name": "Serena E.", "AuthorID": "24336306100", "AffiliationID": "60073808", "AffiliationName": "Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine"}, "36516047100": {"Name": "Zatti S.", "AuthorID": "36516047100", "AffiliationID": "60073808", "AffiliationName": "Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine"}, "54964502300": {"Name": "Zoso A.", "AuthorID": "54964502300", "AffiliationID": "60073808", "AffiliationName": "Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine"}, "56239694100": {"Name": "Lo Verso F.", "AuthorID": "56239694100", "AffiliationID": "60073808", "AffiliationName": "Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine"}, "6603752989": {"Name": "Elvassore N.", "AuthorID": "6603752989", "AffiliationID": "60073808", "AffiliationName": "Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine"}, "7006168683": {"Name": "Tedesco F.", "AuthorID": "7006168683", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006464272": {"Name": "Cossu G.", "AuthorID": "7006464272", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Inflammation and Repair Manchester, University of Manchester"}}}
