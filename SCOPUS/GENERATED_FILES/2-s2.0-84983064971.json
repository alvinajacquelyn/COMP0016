After multiple revisions, soft tissues become suboptimal and chronic wounds develop, causing infection or metalwork extrusion. The authors present their experience with 155 patients at a tertiary orthopedic hospital. Methods: A chart review of patients who required reconstruction as a result of complex joint revision surgery was performed between January of 2006 and January of 2015. All primary joint replacements were excluded. Results: One hundred nineteen flaps were performed, 28 were managed conservatively, and eight were treated with primary amputations. Eighty-four of the patients (71 percent) who had soft-tissue reconstruction were healed at 1-year follow-up. Seven primary free flap failures occurred (11 percent); of these, four of seven patients underwent a second successful free flap reconstruction. A further 12 patients underwent secondary amputation as a result of persistent periprosthetic infection, and 11 patients were managed with long-term oral antimicrobial therapy after declining amputation. Conclusions: The best results are achieved using a combined approach with multidisciplinary input from orthopedic and plastic surgeons with constant specialist clinical microbiology input. All patients had deep tissue samples taken, a long line inserted and, according to microbiology advice, a tailored 6-week regimen of intravenous antibiotics. The data support that early plastic surgery involvement achieved better patient outcomes.
