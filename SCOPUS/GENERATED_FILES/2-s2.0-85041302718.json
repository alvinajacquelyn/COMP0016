Such a relative attenuation of sensory information during actions has already been demonstrated in the somatosensory domain. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a virtual reality-based setup to investigate a potential attenuation of brain responses to realistic visual movement feedback during active vs. passive right-hand movements. The participants\u2019 right unseen hand was rotated either by the participants themselves or by the experimenter, while the participants received visual movement feedback via a photorealistic virtual 3D hand driven by their real hand movements, or received no visual feedback. We observed a significant interaction between movement type (active vs. passive) and movement feedback (vision vs. no vision) in the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), which showed relatively attenuated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal differences in movements with vs. without visual feedback when those movements were actively vs. passively executed. This finding suggests that STS activity caused by visual feedback from the moving body may be attenuated based on the agent's motor predictions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action control", "biological motion", "sensory attenuation", "superior temporal sulcus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Feedback, Sensory", "Female", "Hand", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance", "Temporal Lobe", "Virtual Reality", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041302718", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55871462800": {"Name": "Limanowski J.", "AuthorID": "55871462800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "12752134100": {"Name": "Blankenburg F.", "AuthorID": "12752134100", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Neurocomputation Neuroimaging Unit, Department of Education and Psychology, and Center for Cognitive Neuroscience Berlin, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "57193568760": {"Name": "Sarasso P.", "AuthorID": "57193568760", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "SAMBA (SpAtial, Motor& Bodily Awareness) Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Turin"}}}
