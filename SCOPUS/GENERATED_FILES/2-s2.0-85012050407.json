The aim of the instrument is to map the temporal and spatial variation of trace gases such as ozone and dust/cloud aerosols in the atmosphere of Mars. The instrument consists of a set of two miniature telescope viewing optics which allow for selective input onto the optical bench, where an e2v technologies CCD30-11 will be used as the detector. A Geometry Description Markup Language model of the spacecraft and instrument box was created and through the use of ESA's SPace ENVironment Information System (SPENVIS) an estimate of the 10 MeV equivalent proton fluence was made at a number of radiation sensitive regions within NOMAD, including that of the CCD30-11 which is the focus of this paper. The end of life 10 MeV equivalent proton fluence at the charge coupled device was estimated to be 4.7 \u00d7 109 protons.cm-2; three devices were irradiated at different levels up a 10 MeV equivalent fluence of 9.4 \u00d7 109 protons.cm-2. The dark current, charge transfer inefficiency, charge storage, and cosmetic quality of the devices was investigated pre- and post-irradiation, determining that the devices will continue to provide excellent science throughout the mission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Photon detectors for UV, visible and IR photons (solid-state) (PIN diodes, APDs, Si-PMTs, G-APDs, CCDs, EBCCDs, EMCCDs etc)", "Radiation damage to detector materials (solid state)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge transfer inefficiency", "Detector materials", "PiN diode", "Proton radiation damage", "Radiation environments", "Space environment information systems", "Temporal and spatial variation", "Visible spectrometers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012050407", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"22984865200": {"Name": "Gow J.P.D.", "AuthorID": "22984865200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, Open University, Walton Hall"}, "55552946500": {"Name": "Mason J.", "AuthorID": "55552946500", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, Open University, Walton Hall"}, "7005933791": {"Name": "Leese M.", "AuthorID": "7005933791", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, Open University, Walton Hall"}, "55355326300": {"Name": "Patel M.", "AuthorID": "55355326300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Space Science and Technology Department, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus"}, "6505881570": {"Name": "Hathi B.", "AuthorID": "6505881570", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
