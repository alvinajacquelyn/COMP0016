The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society commissioned a review of the use and clinimetric validation status of measures used in Huntington's disease to assess aspects related with quality of life and to make recommendations on their use following standardized criteria. We included both patient-centered measures (patient health-related quality-of-life measures) and caregiver-centered measures (caregiver quality-of-life measures). After conducting a systematic literature search, we included 12 measures of patient health-related quality of life and 2 measures of caregiver quality of life. Regarding patient-centered measures, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey is \u201crecommended\u201d as a generic assessment of health-related quality of life in patients with Huntington's disease. The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Sickness Impact Profile, the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, and the Huntington's Disease Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire are \u201csuggested.\u201d No caregiver-centered quality-of-life measure obtained a \u201crecommended\u201d status. The Alzheimer's Carer's Quality of Life Inventory and the Huntington's Disease Quality of Life Battery for Carers are \u201csuggested.\u201d Recognizing that the assessment of patient health-related quality of life can be challenging in Huntington's disease, as patients may lack insight and there is insufficient clinimetric testing of these scales, the committee concluded that further validation of currently available health-related quality-of-life measures should be undertaken, namely, those Huntington's disease\u2013specific health-related quality-of-life measures that have recently been reported and used. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregiver-centered outcomes", "Huntington's disease", "patient-centered outcomes", "quality of life", "rating scales"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044302535", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57202566818": {"Name": "Mestre T.A.", "AuthorID": "57202566818", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center, Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Institute"}, "23988533800": {"Name": "Carlozzi N.E.", "AuthorID": "23988533800", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Michigan"}, "7402675285": {"Name": "Ho A.K.", "AuthorID": "7402675285", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7005647679": {"Name": "Burgunder J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005647679", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Swiss HD Center, NeuroZentrumSiloah and Department of Neurology, University of Bern"}, "7202314604": {"Name": "Walker F.", "AuthorID": "7202314604", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "7404295484": {"Name": "Davis A.M.", "AuthorID": "7404295484", "AffiliationID": "60014468, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation and Rehabilitation Institute, University of Toronto"}, "12753300600": {"Name": "Busse M.", "AuthorID": "12753300600", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trials Research, Cardiff University"}, "7005456999": {"Name": "Quinn L.", "AuthorID": "7005456999", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biobehavioral Sciences, Teachers College, Columbia University"}, "57191254295": {"Name": "Rodrigues F.B.", "AuthorID": "57191254295", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon"}, "56933550900": {"Name": "Stebbins G.T.", "AuthorID": "56933550900", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon"}, "35228015300": {"Name": "Sampaio C.", "AuthorID": "35228015300", "AffiliationID": "60096697", "AffiliationName": "CHDI Foundation/CHDI Management"}, "36063561200": {"Name": "Goetz C.G.", "AuthorID": "36063561200", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center"}, "55883404300": {"Name": "Cubo E.", "AuthorID": "55883404300", "AffiliationID": "60113912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Universit\u00e1rio Hermanos Yag\u00fce"}, "7005097519": {"Name": "Martinez-Martin P.", "AuthorID": "7005097519", "AffiliationID": "60085102, 60001602, 60012588", "AffiliationName": "National Center of Epidemiology and Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED) Carlos III Institute of Health"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
