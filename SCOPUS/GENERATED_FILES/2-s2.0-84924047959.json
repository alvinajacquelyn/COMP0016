Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGBP), the most commonly performed procedure, was initially viewed as a hybrid restrictive-malabsorptive procedure. However, over the last decade, it has become apparent that alternative physiologic mechanisms underlie its beneficial effects. RYGBP-induced altered feeding behavior, including reduced appetite and changes in taste/food preferences, is now recognized as a key driver of the sustained postoperative weight loss. The brain ultimately determines feeding behavior, and here we review the mechanisms by which RYGBP may affect central appetite-regulating pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anastomosis, Roux-en-Y", "Animals", "Appetite Regulation", "Feeding Behavior", "Gastric Bypass", "Humans", "Obesity", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924047959", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55815739900": {"Name": "Manning S.", "AuthorID": "55815739900", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University College Cork"}, "37102604700": {"Name": "Pucci A.", "AuthorID": "37102604700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
