In some contexts, it is officially required that uncertainty about both parameters and observable variables be properly taken into account, increasingly often by means of Bayesian methods. Among these, probabilistic sensitivity analysis has assumed a predominant role. The objective of this article is to review the problem of health economic assessment from the standpoint of Bayesian statistical decision theory with particular attention to the philosophy underlying the procedures for sensitivity analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian decision theory", "health economic evaluation", "sensitivity analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Decision Making", "Delivery of Health Care", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Probability", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948399750", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"6603354734": {"Name": "Baio G.", "AuthorID": "6603354734", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55663578500": {"Name": "Dawid A.", "AuthorID": "55663578500", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge"}}}
