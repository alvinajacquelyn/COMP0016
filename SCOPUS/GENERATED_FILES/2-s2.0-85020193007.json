This is especially evident when we consider Africa\u2019s exports, and in particular, highly time-sensitive goods such as agriculture products. Within this context the study and implementation of trade facilitation solutions for Uganda, and in general East Africa, plays an important role. Uganda belongs to one of the largest clusters of 10 landlocked countries spanning Central and East Africa.
