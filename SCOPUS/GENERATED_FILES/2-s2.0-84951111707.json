However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear how to actually evaluate serious experience. We present an evaluation of four games that were submitted to a student game design competition; the competition challenged teams to design a game that inspired curiosity around human error and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The entries were judged by a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing by twelve participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these methods, with particular emphasis on how they enabled a consideration of the immediate and longer term impact of serious experience on players.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical play", "Engagement", "Evaluation", "Games", "Negative experience", "Positive experience", "Serious experience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical play", "Engagement", "Evaluation", "Games", "Negative experiences", "Positive experiences", "Serious experiences"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951111707", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55203936600": {"Name": "Iacovides I.", "AuthorID": "55203936600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre"}}}
