VAV2 and VAV3, members of the VAV family proto-oncogenes, are guanosine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho and Rac GTPase family, which is related with cardiovascular homeostasis. We have analyzed the relationship between the presence of VAV2 rs602990 and VAV3 rs7528153 polymorphisms with cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage (heart, vessels and kidney) in 411 subjects. Our results show that being carrier of the T allele in VAV2 rs602990 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of obesity, reduced levels of ankle-brachial index and diastolic blood pressure and reduced retinal artery caliber. In addition, being carrier of T allele is associated with increased risk of target organ damage in males. On the other hand, being carrier of the T allele in VAV3 rs7528153 polymorphism is associated with a decreased susceptibility of developing a pathologic state composed by the presence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity or cardiovascular damage, and with an increased risk of developing altered basal glycaemia. This is the first report showing an association between VAV2 and VAV3 polymorphisms with cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Ankle Brachial Index", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Pressure", "Body Weight", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav", "Retinal Artery", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011664445", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56064911300": {"Name": "Perretta-Tejedor N.", "AuthorID": "56064911300", "AffiliationID": "60113905", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL)"}, "23466644200": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Ortiz L.", "AuthorID": "23466644200", "AffiliationID": "60113916", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Primary Care Center of la Alamedilla"}, "14048361200": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Marcos M.", "AuthorID": "14048361200", "AffiliationID": "60113916", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Primary Care Center of la Alamedilla"}, "26323788200": {"Name": "Recio-Rodr\u00edguez J.", "AuthorID": "26323788200", "AffiliationID": "60113916", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Primary Care Center of la Alamedilla"}, "36760384700": {"Name": "Agudo-Conde C.", "AuthorID": "36760384700", "AffiliationID": "60113916", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Primary Care Center of la Alamedilla"}, "7202369767": {"Name": "Morales A.", "AuthorID": "7202369767", "AffiliationID": "60113905", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL)"}, "27067826800": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Hern\u00e1ndez F.", "AuthorID": "27067826800", "AffiliationID": "60113905", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL)"}, "6701349774": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Salgado C.", "AuthorID": "6701349774", "AffiliationID": "60113905", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL)"}, "57188988394": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Mateos J.", "AuthorID": "57188988394", "AffiliationID": "60025028, 60006754, 60103760", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine Unit, University of Salamanca and Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer (IBMCC), University of Salamanca-CSIC"}, "24068989300": {"Name": "Rodriguez-S\u00e1nchez E.", "AuthorID": "24068989300", "AffiliationID": "60113916", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Primary Care Center of la Alamedilla"}, "56880472000": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Novoa J.", "AuthorID": "56880472000", "AffiliationID": "60025028", "AffiliationName": "Renal and Cardiovascular Pathophysiology Unit, Institute Reina Sofia of Nephrological Research, University of Salamanca"}, "7003610506": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Sarmiento R.", "AuthorID": "7003610506", "AffiliationID": "60025028, 60006754, 60103760", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine Unit, University of Salamanca and Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer (IBMCC), University of Salamanca-CSIC"}}}
