Our objective was to ascertain the existence of selection bias due to under-inclusion of populations with ID across all fields of autism research. A sub-goal was to evaluate inconsistencies in reporting of findings. Methods: This review covers all original research published in 2016 in autism-specific journals with an impact factor greater than 3. Across 301 included studies, 100,245 participants had ASD. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the proportion of participants without ID. Selection bias was defined as where more than 75% of participants did not have ID. Results: Meta-analysis estimated 94% of all participants identified as being on the autism spectrum in the studies reviewed did not have ID (95% CI 0.91-0.97). Eight out of ten studies demonstrated selection bias against participants with ID. The reporting of participant characteristics was generally poor: information about participants' intellectual ability was absent in 38% of studies (n = 114). Where there was selection bias on ID, only 31% of studies mentioned lack of generalisability as a limitation. Conclusions: We found selection bias against ID throughout all fields of autism research. We recommend transparent reporting about ID and strategies for inclusion for this much marginalised group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Autism spectrum disorder", "Intellectual disability", "Nosology", "Selection bias"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Patient Selection", "Selection Bias"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062849523", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36020699200": {"Name": "Russell G.", "AuthorID": "36020699200", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "College House, University of Exeter, Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "57212942850": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "57212942850", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "College House, University of Exeter, Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "57217366377": {"Name": "Elliott D.", "AuthorID": "57217366377", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Social Science and International Studies, Byrne House, University of Exeter"}, "57207778676": {"Name": "White R.", "AuthorID": "57207778676", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Social Science and International Studies, Byrne House, University of Exeter"}, "57207772983": {"Name": "Pittwood T.", "AuthorID": "57207772983", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Brain in Hand, Innovations Centre, University of Exeter"}}}
