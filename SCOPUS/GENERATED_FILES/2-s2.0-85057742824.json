This was attributed to the production of implants with reduced diametrical clearances between their bearing surfaces, which, it was speculated, were outside manufacturing tolerances. This study aimed to better understand the performance of Pinnacle systems manufactured before and after this event. Methods A total of 92 retrieved MoM Pinnacle hips were analyzed, of which 45 were implanted before 2007, and 47 from 2007 onwards. The \u2018pre-2007\u2019 group contained 45 implants retrieved from 21 male and 24 female patients, with a median age of 61.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 57.1 to 65.5); the \u20182007 onwards\u2019 group contained 47 implants retrieved from 19 male and 28 female patients, with a median age of 61.8 years (IQR 58.5 to 67.8). The volume of material lost from their bearing and taper surfaces was measured using coordinate and roundness measuring machines. These outcomes were then compared statistically using linear regression models, adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Results There was no significant difference between the taper and bearing wear rates of the \u2018pre-2007\u2019 and \u20182007 onwards\u2019 groups (p = 0.67 and p = 0.39, respectively). Pinnacles implanted from 2007 onwards were revised after a mean time of 50 months, which was significantly earlier than the \u2018pre-2007\u2019 hips (96 months) (p < 0.001). A reduction in the time to revision was present year on year from 2003 to 2011. Conclusion We found no difference in the wear rate of these implants based on the year of implantation. The \u2018pre-2007\u2019 hips had a two-fold greater time to revision than those implanted after 2007; this may be due to the increased surveillance of MoM hips following UK regulatory advice and several high-profile failures. Interestingly, we observed a decreasing trend in the mean time to revision every year from 2003 onwards.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Material loss", "Metal-on-metal", "Retrieval", "Wear analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057742824", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57204899818": {"Name": "Bergiers S.", "AuthorID": "57204899818", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8283685400": {"Name": "Eskelinen A.", "AuthorID": "8283685400", "AffiliationID": "60098936", "AffiliationName": "Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "106639497", "AffiliationName": null}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
