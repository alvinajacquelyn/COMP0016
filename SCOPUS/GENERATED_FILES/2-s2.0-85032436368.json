Tracking calorimeter experiments have particular strengths, including the ability to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay amongst several different isotopes hosted in source foils. Full event reconstruction provides powerful background rejection capability, and the ability to disentangle different mechanisms for neutrinoless double-beta decay in the event of its discovery. These proceedings will give the latest results from the NEMO-3 experiment, including new double-beta decay measurements using the isotopes 48Ca and 150Nd. The current status and future prospects for the SuperNEMO experiment will also be presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Background rejection capability", "Different mechanisms", "Double beta decay", "Event reconstruction", "Future prospects", "Neutrino physics", "Neutrinoless double-beta decays", "Sensitive probe"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032436368", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35228205900": {"Name": "Waters D.", "AuthorID": "35228205900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
