Although the frequency and severity of drought and heat extremes increase substantially in range of future climate scenarios by five Earth System Models, the vulnerability of beer supply to such extremes has never been assessed. We couple a process-based crop model (decision support system for agrotechnology transfer) and a global economic model (Global Trade Analysis Project model) to evaluate the effects of concurrent drought and heat extremes projected under a range of future climate scenarios. We find that these extreme events may cause substantial decreases in barley yields worldwide. Average yield losses range from 3% to 17% depending on the severity of the conditions. Decreases in the global supply of barley lead to proportionally larger decreases in barley used to make beer and ultimately result in dramatic regional decreases in beer consumption (for example, \u221232% in Argentina) and increases in beer prices (for example, +193% in Ireland). Although not the most concerning impact of future climate change, climate-related weather extremes may threaten the availability and economic accessibility of beer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Beer", "Climate Change", "Crop Production", "Droughts", "Extreme Heat", "Hordeum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054922912", "SubjectAreas": [["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"]], "AuthorData": {"35212707700": {"Name": "Xie W.", "AuthorID": "35212707700", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "China Center for Agricultural Policy, School of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University"}, "55543788800": {"Name": "Ali T.", "AuthorID": "55543788800", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "China Center for Agricultural Policy, School of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University"}, "57204326613": {"Name": "Xiong W.", "AuthorID": "57204326613", "AffiliationID": "60002833", "AffiliationName": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University"}, "55459083600": {"Name": "Pan J.", "AuthorID": "55459083600", "AffiliationID": "60017705", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"}, "7201721161": {"Name": "Lin E.", "AuthorID": "7201721161", "AffiliationID": "60017705", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"}, "57192955587": {"Name": "Cui Q.", "AuthorID": "57192955587", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics and Resource Management, Beijing Normal University"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge"}, "52364731900": {"Name": "Mueller N.", "AuthorID": "52364731900", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Science, University of California"}, "57207228835": {"Name": "Davis S.", "AuthorID": "57207228835", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}}}
