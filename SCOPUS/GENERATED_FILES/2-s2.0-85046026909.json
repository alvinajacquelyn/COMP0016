Publications on the natural history of MLIII, especially the milder forms, are scarce. This study provides a detailed description of the disease characteristics and its natural course in adult patients with MLIII. Methods: In this retrospective chart study, the clinical, biochemical and molecular findings in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MLIII from three treatment centres were collected. Results: Thirteen patients with MLIII were included in this study. Four patients (31%) were initially misdiagnosed with a type of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). Four patients (31%) had mild cognitive impairment. Six patients (46%) needed help with activities of daily living (ADL) or were wheelchair-dependent. All patients had dysostosis multiplex and progressive secondary osteoarthritis, characterised by cartilage destruction and bone lesions in multiple joints. All patients underwent multiple orthopaedic surgical interventions as early as the second or third decades of life, of which total hip replacement (THR) was the most common procedure (61% of patients). Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was found in 12 patients (92%) and in eight patients (61%), CTS release was performed. Conclusions: Severe skeletal abnormalities, resulting from abnormal bone development and severe progressive osteoarthritis, are the hallmark of MLIII, necessitating surgical orthopaedic interventions early in life. Future therapies for this disease should focus on improving cartilage and bone quality, preventing skeletal complications and improving mobility.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mucolipidoses", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046026909", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"25648362600": {"Name": "Oussoren E.", "AuthorID": "25648362600", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC\u2014Sophia Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "54896103800": {"Name": "van der Meijden J.C.", "AuthorID": "54896103800", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC\u2014Sophia Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7003544755": {"Name": "van der Ploeg A.T.", "AuthorID": "7003544755", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC\u2014Sophia Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57201745671": {"Name": "van Eerd D.", "AuthorID": "57201745671", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC"}, "6507763632": {"Name": "Langendonk J.G.", "AuthorID": "6507763632", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC"}, "56497461300": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "56497461300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003596979": {"Name": "Lachmann R.", "AuthorID": "7003596979", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003305930": {"Name": "Hoefsloot L.H.", "AuthorID": "7003305930", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC"}, "7004172949": {"Name": "Ruijter G.J.G.", "AuthorID": "7004172949", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Center for Lysosomal and Metabolic Diseases, Erasmus MC"}, "36762713000": {"Name": "Verdijk R.", "AuthorID": "36762713000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC"}, "7103204541": {"Name": "Maas M.", "AuthorID": "7103204541", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7004900877": {"Name": "Hollak C.E.M.", "AuthorID": "7004900877", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "14060686900": {"Name": "Langeveld M.", "AuthorID": "14060686900", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}}}
