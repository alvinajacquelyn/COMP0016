The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We obtained high-speed photometry of the disintegrating planetesimals orbiting the white dwarf WD 1145+017, spanning a period of four weeks. The light curves show a dramatic evolution of the system since the first observations obtained about seven months ago. Multiple transit events are detected in every light curve, which have varying durations (\u22433-12 minutes) and depths (\u224310%-60%). The time-averaged extinction is \u224311%, much higher than at the time of the Kepler observations. The shortest-duration transits require that the occulting cloud of debris has a few times the size of the white dwarf, longer events are often resolved into the superposition of several individual transits. The transits evolve on timescales of days, both in shape and in depth, with most of them gradually appearing and disappearing over the course of the observing campaign. Several transits can be tracked across multiple nights, all of them recur on periods of \u22434.49 hr, indicating multiple planetary debris fragments on nearly identical orbits. Identifying the specific origin of these bodies within this planetary system, and the evolution leading to their current orbits remains a challenging problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["minor planets, asteroids: general", "planetary systems", "stars: individual (WD 1145+017) Supporting material: tar.gz file"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958206149", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7004303221": {"Name": "Gansicke B.T.", "AuthorID": "7004303221", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7101898059": {"Name": "Marsh T.R.", "AuthorID": "7101898059", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "6508285780": {"Name": "Veras D.", "AuthorID": "6508285780", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "55263522600": {"Name": "Chote P.", "AuthorID": "55263522600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "57117330000": {"Name": "Ashley R.", "AuthorID": "57117330000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7003459662": {"Name": "Pollacco D.", "AuthorID": "7003459662", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "8537070800": {"Name": "Aungwerojwit A.", "AuthorID": "8537070800", "AffiliationID": "60022498", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Naresuan University"}, "57203173473": {"Name": "Dhillon V.S.", "AuthorID": "57203173473", "AffiliationID": "60011125", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, E-38205 la Laguna"}, "55566346100": {"Name": "Sahman D.I.", "AuthorID": "55566346100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "6602353595": {"Name": "Littlefair S.P.", "AuthorID": "6602353595", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "8602068200": {"Name": "Farihi J.", "AuthorID": "8602068200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57118116000": {"Name": "Arjyotha S.", "AuthorID": "57118116000", "AffiliationID": "60110518", "AffiliationName": "Program of Physics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Chiang Rai Rajabhat University"}, "36662813300": {"Name": "Rattanasoon S.", "AuthorID": "36662813300", "AffiliationID": "107253005", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, 191 Siriphanich Bldg."}, "7004395946": {"Name": "Burleigh M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004395946", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}}}
