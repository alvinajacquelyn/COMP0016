Design Retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting Administrative data on entrants to all UK medical schools from the UK Medical Education Database. Participants 10 559 doctors (6 155; 58% female) who entered a UK medical school in 2007 or 2008 and were eligible to apply for specialty training by 2015. Primary outcome measure Odds of application, offer and acceptance to any specialty training programme, and on to each of the nine largest training programmes, adjusting for sex, other demographics, prior academic attainment, FtP declaration and medical school. Results Across all specialties, there were no sex differences in applications for specialty training, but women had increased odds of getting an offer (OR=1.40; 95% CI=1.25 to 1.57; p<0.001) and accepting one (OR=1.43; 95% CI=1.19 to 1.71; p<0.001). Seven of the nine largest specialties showed significant sex differences in applications, which remained after adjusting for other factors. In the adjusted models, Paediatrics (OR=1.57; 95% CI=1.01 to 2.46; p=0.046) and general practice (GP) (OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.03 to 1.46; p=0.017) were the only specialties to show sex differences in offers, both favouring women. GP alone showed sex differences in acceptances, with women being more likely to accept (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.03 to 1.76; p=0.03). Doctors with an FtP declaration were slightly less likely to apply to specialty training overall (OR=0.84; 95% CI=0.71 to 1.00; p=0.048) and less likely to accept an offer to any programme (OR=0.71; 95% CI=0.52 to 0.98; p=0.036), after adjusting for confounders. Conclusions Sex segregation between medical specialties is due to differential application, although research is needed to understand why men are less likely to be offered a place on to GP and Paediatrics training, and if offered GP are less likely to accept.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic attainment", "fitness to practise", "medical workforce", "professionalism", "sex differences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Job Application", "Male", "Medicine", "Physicians, Women", "Schools, Medical", "Specialization", "Students, Medical", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062587238", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"25223923300": {"Name": "Woolf K.", "AuthorID": "25223923300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, University College London Medical School"}, "57200131733": {"Name": "Jayaweera H.", "AuthorID": "57200131733", "AffiliationID": "60009834, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Neuropsychiatry, University of Western Australia"}, "23989816900": {"Name": "Unwin E.", "AuthorID": "23989816900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, University College London Medical School"}, "57200134952": {"Name": "Keshwani K.", "AuthorID": "57200134952", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57200130871": {"Name": "Valerio C.", "AuthorID": "57200130871", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Informatics and Multiprofessional Education, UCL"}}}
