MM approaches have been particularly successful to tackle inverse problems and statistical machine learning problems where the regularization term is a sparsity-promoting concave function. However, due to non-convexity, the solution found by MM depends on its initialization. Uniform initialization is the most natural and often employed strategy as it boils down to penalizing all coefficients equally in the first MM iteration. Yet, this arbitrary choice can lead to unsatisfactory results in severely under-determined inverse problems such as source imaging with magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG). The framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is an alternative approach to encode sparsity. This work shows that for certain hierarchical models, a simple alternating scheme to compute fully Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates leads to the exact same sequence of updates as a standard MM strategy (see the adaptive lasso). With this parallel outlined, we show how to improve upon these MM techniques by probing the multimodal posterior density using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Firstly, we show that these samples can provide well-informed initializations that help MM schemes to reach better local minima. Secondly, we demonstrate how it can reveal the different modes of the posterior distribution in order to explore and quantify the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of such ill-posed inference procedure. In the context of M/EEG, each mode corresponds to a plausible configuration of neural sources, which is crucial for data interpretation, especially in clinical contexts. Results on both simulations and real datasets show how the number or the type of sensors affect the uncertainties on the estimates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hierarchical Bayesian modeling", "M/EEG inverse problems", "majorization-minimization", "MCMC sampling", "sparse models", "uncertainty quantification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hierarchical Bayesian modeling", "Majorization minimizations", "MCMC sampling", "Sparse models", "Uncertainty quantifications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049741759", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56317050900": {"Name": "Bekhti Y.", "AuthorID": "56317050900", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60072950, 60029116", "AffiliationName": "LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "57189092415": {"Name": "Salmon J.", "AuthorID": "57189092415", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60072950, 60029116", "AffiliationName": "LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "23388890700": {"Name": "Gramfort A.", "AuthorID": "23388890700", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "INRIA, Parietal Team, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "52364146500": {"Name": "Lucka F.", "AuthorID": "52364146500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
