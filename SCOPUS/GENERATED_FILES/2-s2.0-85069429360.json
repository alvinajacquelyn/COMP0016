Treatment of CS could be challenging, and the only evidence-based data comes from case reports or series. Areas covered: There have recently been several reports of new treatment strategy involving the use of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as TNF\u03b1 inhibitors, anti-CD20 or anti-IL6 receptor antibodies, in cases resistant to first- or second-line drugs. Expert commentary: Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of CS therapy at disease onset and during acute phases of the disease. Conventional immunosuppressive therapy, such as methotrexate, could be used in relapsing patients or as a glucocorticoid sparing agent, but efficacy is often modest. The anti-TNF\u03b1 monoclonal antibody Infliximab appears to be the most frequently used, leading to an improvement in hearing loss in 89% of the cases and allow corticosteroid tapering in 86% of the patients. The appropriate timing of Infliximab treatment has yet to be thoroughly investigated, but it seems to be more effective when started at an early stage of the disease. Efficacy of others anti-TNF\u03b1 agents is controversial. Rituximab and Tocilizumab are a safe option, but results on hearing loss have still to be confirmed on larger patients\u2019 cohorts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-TNF\u03b1", "biological agents", "Cogan\u2019s syndrome", "hearing loss", "infliximab", "rituximab", "tocilizumab", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cogan Syndrome", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infliximab", "Rituximab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069429360", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57192703292": {"Name": "Padoan R.", "AuthorID": "57192703292", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, University of Padova"}, "55389713800": {"Name": "Felicetti M.", "AuthorID": "55389713800", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, University of Padova"}, "19536672500": {"Name": "Schiavon F.", "AuthorID": "19536672500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, University of Padova"}, "56076195200": {"Name": "Cazzador D.", "AuthorID": "56076195200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Section of Human Anatomy, Department of Neuroscience, University of Padova"}, "57208940637": {"Name": "Pendolino A.L.", "AuthorID": "57208940637", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Otorhinolaryngology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "6508251192": {"Name": "Zanoletti E.", "AuthorID": "6508251192", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Otorhinolaryngology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "14120743800": {"Name": "Bovo R.", "AuthorID": "14120743800", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Otorhinolaryngology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "7202003953": {"Name": "Martini A.", "AuthorID": "7202003953", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Otorhinolaryngology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "23004137500": {"Name": "De Pascalis S.", "AuthorID": "23004137500", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Unit, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Bologna"}}}
