This paper considers the perceptions and priorities of local residents about traffic impacts and possible mitigation measures, using as a case study a rural area that will be affected by traffic associated with the construction of a nuclear power station. The study consisted of a qualitative phase followed by a stated preference survey. Econometric models were used to measure the relative priority of different impacts and mitigation measures. The most impactful aspects were noise, vibration and increased car or bus travel times. The most preferred measures were night-time restrictions to HGVs, parking restrictions and safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists. There were significant differences in preferences according to residence location, gender, employment status and household composition. The results provide information about aspects that tend to be aggregated in existing assessment frameworks, separating the reduction in the utility of some activities (like walking and driving) and the suppression of those activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Social impacts of traffic", "stated preference", "traffic control", "traffic impact assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007035045", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"24079709800": {"Name": "Anciaes P.R.", "AuthorID": "24079709800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "57192649099": {"Name": "Metcalfe P.J.", "AuthorID": "57192649099", "AffiliationID": "119675544", "AffiliationName": "PJM Economics"}, "8453234200": {"Name": "Heywood C.", "AuthorID": "8453234200", "AffiliationID": "60099157", "AffiliationName": "Accent"}}}
