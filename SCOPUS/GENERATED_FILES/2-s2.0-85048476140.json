The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the surgical options for maxillary correction in patients with unilateral CFM. Material and methods: MEDLINE/Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were searched up to April 15, 2017. Inclusion criteria were: studies reporting patients with unilateral CFM (n > 4) who had maxillary correction (with/without simultaneous mandibular correction) with a minimal follow-up of 6 months. The outcome measures included type of treatment (including preceding facial procedures), type and severity of mandibular deformity (by Pruzansky-Kaban system: Types I/IIa/IIb/III), asymmetry analysis method, outcome (i.e. occlusion, canting, stability, esthetic result, facial symmetry), complications and additional treatment needed. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Analysis showed that Le Fort I + mandibular distraction osteogenesis (LeFort + MDO) and BiMaxillary osteotomy (BiMax) were used for treatment, as single or multiple-stage procedures. All studies reported aesthetic and functional improvement. Conclusion: Types I/IIa benefited from LeFort + MDO; Type IIb from LeFort + MDO or BiMax; and Type III from BiMax (with 50% of cases having preceding mandibular procedures, including patient-fitted prosthesis) at a mean age of 20.2 years. Four studies recommended additional (esthetic) procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bimaxillary osteotomy", "Craniofacial microsomia", "Hemifacial microsomia", "Le Fort Osteotomy", "Mandibular distraction osteogenesis", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Esthetics, Dental", "Facial Asymmetry", "Goldenhar Syndrome", "Humans", "Mandibular Reconstruction", "Maxillofacial Development", "Osteogenesis, Distraction", "Osteotomy, Le Fort"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048476140", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57196370439": {"Name": "van de Lande L.S.", "AuthorID": "57196370439", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "54793463300": {"Name": "Pluijmers B.I.", "AuthorID": "54793463300", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "The Dutch Craniofacial Center, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "55951479500": {"Name": "Caron C.J.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55951479500", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "The Dutch Craniofacial Center, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "6602721170": {"Name": "Wolvius E.B.", "AuthorID": "6602721170", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "The Dutch Craniofacial Center, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "6603112761": {"Name": "Koudstaal M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603112761", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The Craniofacial Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004067604": {"Name": "Padwa B.L.", "AuthorID": "7004067604", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The Craniofacial Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
