The router architecture is based on a combination of waveband and channel routing by coarse and fine AWGs, respectively. We fabricated several T-band-specific silica-based AWGs and quantum dot semiconductor optical ampliers as part of the router, and demonstrated 10 Gbps data transmission for several wavelengths throughout a range of 7.4 THz. The power penalties were below 1 dB. Wavelength routing was also demonstrated, where tuning time within a 9.4-nm-wide waveband was below 400 ms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Channel routing", "Power penalty", "Router architecture", "Tuning time", "Ultra-broadband", "Wavebands", "Wavelength router", "Wavelength routing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962184542", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56027835700": {"Name": "Idris N.", "AuthorID": "56027835700", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Gradute School of Science and Technology, Keio University"}, "55406043600": {"Name": "Kubo R.", "AuthorID": "55406043600", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Gradute School of Science and Technology, Keio University"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "HPN Group, University of Bristol"}, "35249615700": {"Name": "Tsuda H.", "AuthorID": "35249615700", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Gradute School of Science and Technology, Keio University"}, "56612894600": {"Name": "Yoshizawa K.", "AuthorID": "56612894600", "AffiliationID": "60116049", "AffiliationName": "Pioneer Micro Technology Corp."}, "55881700000": {"Name": "Tomomatsu Y.", "AuthorID": "55881700000", "AffiliationID": "60116058", "AffiliationName": "Koshin Kogaku Co., Ltd."}, "57188664424": {"Name": "Sudo M.", "AuthorID": "57188664424", "AffiliationID": "60116046", "AffiliationName": "Optoquest Co., Ltd."}, "57188663607": {"Name": "Hajikano T.", "AuthorID": "57188663607", "AffiliationID": "60116046", "AffiliationName": "Optoquest Co., Ltd."}}}
