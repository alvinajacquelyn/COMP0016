These sites have been revealed using local photoluminescence mapping techniques but the short absorption depth of photons with energies above the bandgap means that conventional one-photon excitation primarily probes the surface recombination. Here, we use two-photon time-resolved confocal photoluminescence microscopy to explore the surface and bulk recombination properties of methylammonium lead halide perovskite structures. By acquiring 2D maps at different depths, we form 3D photoluminescence tomography images to visualise the charge carrier recombination kinetics. The technique unveils buried recombination pathways in both thin film and micro-crystal structures that aren't captured in conventional one-photon mapping experiments. Specifically, we reveal that light-induced passivation approaches are primarily surface-sensitive and that nominal single crystals still contain heterogeneous defects that impact charge-carrier recombination. Our work opens a new route to sensitively probe defects and associated non-radiative processes in perovskites, highlighting additional loss pathways in these materials that will need to be addressed through improved sample processing or passivation treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge carrier recombination", "Confocal photoluminescences", "Light emission devices", "One photon excitations", "Passivation treatment", "Perovskite structures", "Photoluminescence mapping", "Surface recombinations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055321312", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57193084402": {"Name": "Stavrakas C.", "AuthorID": "57193084402", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "55864987800": {"Name": "Abdi-Jalebi M.", "AuthorID": "55864987800", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "35224069200": {"Name": "Stranks S.D.", "AuthorID": "35224069200", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57192430998": {"Name": "Zhumekenov A.A.", "AuthorID": "57192430998", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "14053604900": {"Name": "Bakr O.M.", "AuthorID": "14053604900", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "57008082100": {"Name": "Brenes R.", "AuthorID": "57008082100", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7003553668": {"Name": "Bulovi\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "7003553668", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "25521492400": {"Name": "Barnard E.S.", "AuthorID": "25521492400", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}}}
