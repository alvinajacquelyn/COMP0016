In the coalgebraic perspective, the first approach can be phrased in terms of a minimization construction along the final sequence of a functor, whereas a crucial part of the second approach is based on a reachability construction along the initial sequence of another functor. We employ this coalgebraic perspective to establish a precise relationship between the two approaches to minimization, and show how they can be combined. Part of these results are extended to an approach for language equivalence of a general class of systems with branching, such as non-deterministic automata.", "AuthorKeywords": ["automata", "coalgebra", "minimization"], "IndexKeywords": ["automata", "Coalgebras", "Deterministic automata", "Determinization", "Hopcroft's algorithms", "Moore's algorithms", "Nondeterministic automata", "Partition refinement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992358996", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55305790900": {"Name": "Rot J.", "AuthorID": "55305790900", "AffiliationID": "60005667, 60108310, 60008134, 60023578, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, ENS de Lyon, CNRS, UCB Lyon 1, LIP"}}}
