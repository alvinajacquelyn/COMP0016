In type-2 diabetes, human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) forms amyloids, which contribute to \u03b2-cell death and dysfunction in the disease. IAPP-membrane interactions are potential mechanisms of cytotoxicity. In vitro studies have shown that cholesterol significantly modulates the ability of model membranes to induce IAPP amyloid formation and IAPP-mediated membrane damage. It is not known if this is due to the general effects of cholesterol on membranes or because of specific sterol-IAPP interactions. The effects of replacing cholesterol with eight other sterols/steroids on IAPP binding to model membranes, membrane disruption, and membrane-mediated amyloid formation were examined. The primary effect of the sterols/steroids on the IAPP-membrane interactions was found to reflect their effect upon membrane order as judged by fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Specific IAPP-sterol/steroid interactions have smaller effects. The fraction of vesicles that bind IAPP was inversely correlated with the sterols/steroids' effect on membrane order, as was the extent of IAPP-induced membrane leakage and the time to form amyloids. The correlation between the fraction of vesicles binding IAPP and membrane leakage was particularly tight, suggesting the restriction of IAPP to a subset of vesicles is responsible for incomplete leakage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid formation", "Amyloidogenic proteins", "Fluorescence anisotropy measurements", "Islet amyloid polypeptides", "Membrane disruption", "Membrane interactions", "Membrane leakages", "Potential mechanism", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Cholesterol", "Humans", "Islet Amyloid Polypeptide", "Membranes, Artificial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044652668", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"55940708500": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "55940708500", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7102121768": {"Name": "London E.", "AuthorID": "7102121768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Stony Brook University"}}}
