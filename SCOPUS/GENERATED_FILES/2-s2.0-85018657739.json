Analysis of T4S system architecture is an extremely challenging task taking into account their multi protein organisation and lack of overall global symmetry. Nonetheless the last decade demonstrated an amazing progress achieved by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. In this review we present a structural analysis of this dynamic complex based on recent advances in biochemical, biophysical and structural studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron microscopy", "Mechanism of action", "Structural analysis", "T4S system"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018657739", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"16319961600": {"Name": "Redzej A.", "AuthorID": "16319961600", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "7004804200": {"Name": "Waksman G.", "AuthorID": "7004804200", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "56961714600": {"Name": "Orlova E.V.", "AuthorID": "56961714600", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}}}
