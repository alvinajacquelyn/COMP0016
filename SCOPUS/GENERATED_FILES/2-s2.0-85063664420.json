The method combines a contrast-adaptive generative model for whole-brain segmentation with a new spatial regularization model of tumor shape using convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines. We demonstrate experimentally that the method is able to adapt to image acquisitions that differ substantially from any available training data, ensuring its applicability across treatment sites; that its tumor segmentation accuracy is comparable to that of the current state of the art; and that it captures most organs-at-risk sufficiently well for radiation therapy planning purposes. The proposed method may be a valuable step towards automating the delineation of brain tumors and organs-at-risk in glioblastoma patients undergoing radiation therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Generative probabilistic model", "Glioma", "Restricted Boltzmann machine", "Whole-brain segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive methods", "Glioma", "Probabilistic modeling", "Restricted boltzmann machine", "Spatial regularizations", "State of the art", "Tumor segmentation", "Whole brains", "Brain Neoplasms", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Organs at Risk", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063664420", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56596842000": {"Name": "Agn M.", "AuthorID": "56596842000", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, Technical University of Denmark"}, "6601997723": {"Name": "Van Leemput K.", "AuthorID": "6601997723", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Athinoula A.
