Karger AG, Basel.Purpose: Currently, no outcome measures are clinically validated and accepted as clinical endpoints by regulatory agencies for drug development in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). The MACUSTAR Consortium, a public-private research group funded by the European Innovative Medicines Initiative intends to close this gap. Procedures: Development of study protocol and statistical analysis plan including predictive modelling of multimodal endpoints based on a review of the literature and expert consensus. Results: This observational study consists of a cross-sectional and a longitudinal part. Functional outcome measures assessed under low contrast and low luminance have the potential to detect progression of visual deficit within iAMD and to late AMD. Structural outcome measures will be multimodal and investigate topographical relationships with function. Current patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are not acceptable to regulators and may not capture the functional deficit specific to iAMD with needed precision, justifying development of novel PROMs for iAMD. The total sample size will be n = 750, consisting mainly of subjects with iAMD (n = 600). Conclusions: As clinical endpoints currently accepted by regulators cannot detect functional loss or patient-relevant impact in iAMD, we will clinically validate novel candidate endpoints for iAMD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical endpoint", "Disease progression", "Intermediate age-related macular degeneration", "Patient-reported outcomes", "Structure-function correlation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Management", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Retina", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052987876", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"25926257600": {"Name": "Finger R.P.", "AuthorID": "25926257600", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "6507005629": {"Name": "Schmitz-Valckenberg S.", "AuthorID": "6507005629", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "57201820304": {"Name": "Holz F.G.", "AuthorID": "57201820304", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "57197010260": {"Name": "Schmid M.", "AuthorID": "57197010260", "AffiliationID": "60030465", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Biometry, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Hospital Bonn"}, "57204026504": {"Name": "Rubin G.S.", "AuthorID": "57204026504", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "26640416400": {"Name": "Dunbar H.", "AuthorID": "26640416400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "54790536300": {"Name": "Crabb D.P.", "AuthorID": "54790536300", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Optometry and Visual Science, School of Health Sciences, City University of London"}, "10040523200": {"Name": "Binns A.", "AuthorID": "10040523200", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Optometry and Visual Science, School of Health Sciences, City University of London"}, "8543425100": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez C.I.", "AuthorID": "8543425100", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6602164059": {"Name": "Margaron P.", "AuthorID": "6602164059", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "57206530095": {"Name": "Normand G.", "AuthorID": "57206530095", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "6507090823": {"Name": "Zamiri P.", "AuthorID": "6507090823", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "36192737600": {"Name": "Durbin M.K.", "AuthorID": "36192737600", "AffiliationID": "100376638", "AffiliationName": "Carl Zeiss Meditec AG"}, "9532683500": {"Name": "Luhmann U.F.O.", "AuthorID": "9532683500", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, Translational Medicine Ophthalmology, Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel"}, "55406837600": {"Name": "Cunha-Vaz J.", "AuthorID": "55406837600", "AffiliationID": "60094275", "AffiliationName": "Association for Innovation and Biomedical Research on Light and Image"}, "57207903247": {"Name": "Asmus F.", "AuthorID": "57207903247", "AffiliationID": "60006680", "AffiliationName": "Development Pharmaceuticals, Therapeutic Areas PAO, Bayer AG"}}}
