All rights reserved.Calcium phosphate cements (CPC)s are conventionally made by mixing crystalline calcium phosphates with aqueous solutions. In this study new CPCs are made by reacting bioactive glasses (BG)s with Ca(H2PO4)2 to form cement. It is found that high P2O5 content of 4 mol% or greater is required in BG to produce a cement. The phases formed are dependent on glass composition; brushite and octacalcium phosphate (OCP) form first with 6 mol% P2O5 BG. Brushite dissolves, reforms as OCP, then transforms to apatite. These new cements offer new route to forming CPC that combine in-situ setting and injectability of CPCs with resorbability and bioactivity of BGs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apatite cement", "Bioactive glass", "Brushite cement", "Calcium phosphate cement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brushite", "Brushite cement", "Calcium phosphate cement", "Glass compositions", "Injectability", "New cements", "Octacalcium phosphate", "Reactive precursors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943374688", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55889907600": {"Name": "Kent N.", "AuthorID": "55889907600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404751809": {"Name": "Hill R.", "AuthorID": "7404751809", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Dental Physical Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602684441": {"Name": "Karpukhina N.", "AuthorID": "6602684441", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Dental Physical Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
