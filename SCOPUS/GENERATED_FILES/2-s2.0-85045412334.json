One of the common methods in DR, is CPP (Critical Peak Pricing). Predicting energy consumption is recognized as one of the tool for dealing with CPP. There are a variety of studies in developing the model of energy consumption, which is based on energy simulation, data-driven model or metamodelling. However, it is difficult for general users to use these models due to requirement of various sensing data and expertise. And it also takes long time to simulate the models. These limitations can be an obstacle for achieving CPP's purpose that encourages general users to manage their energy usage by themselves. As an alternative, this research suggests to use open data and GA (Genetic Algorithm)-SVR (Support Vector Regression). The model is applied to a hospital in Korea and 34,636 data sets (1 year) are collected while 31,756 (11 months) sets are used for training and 2880 sets (1 month) are used for validation. As a result, the performance of proposed model is 14.17% in CV (RMSE), which satisfies the Korea Energy Agency's and ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) error allowance range of \u00b130%, and \u00b120% respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CPP (Critical Peak Pricing)", "Electricity consumption prediction", "GA-SVR (Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine)", "Open data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical peak pricing", "DR (demand response)", "Electricity-consumption", "GA (genetic algorithm)", "Genetic algorithm support vector machines", "Model of energy consumption", "Open datum", "Support vector regression (SVR)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045412334", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57204182476": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57204182476", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, Bartlett, University College London"}, "57204172151": {"Name": "Hae H.", "AuthorID": "57204172151", "AffiliationID": "60006504", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Hansung University"}, "35731699400": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "35731699400", "AffiliationID": "60024872", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architectural Engineering, Hanyang University"}}}
