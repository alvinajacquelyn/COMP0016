Bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in the perforin gene are invariably associated with a fatal immunoregulatory disorder, familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (FHL2), in infants. More recently, it has also been recognized that partial loss of perforin function can cause disease in later life, including delayed onset FHL2 and haematological malignancies. Herein, we report a family in which a wide range of systemic inflammatory and neoplastic manifestations have occurred across three generations. We found that disease was linked to two missense perforin gene mutations (encoding A91V, R410W) that cause protein misfolding and partial loss of activity. These cases link the partial loss of perforin function with some solid tumors that are known to be controlled by the immune system, as well as haematological cancers. Our findings also demonstrate that perforin gene mutations can contribute to hereditary cancer predisposition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hereditary cancer", "perforin", "protein misfolding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976553487", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"35836645400": {"Name": "Chaudhry M.S.", "AuthorID": "35836645400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Imperial College London"}, "7006791228": {"Name": "Layton M.", "AuthorID": "7006791228", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Imperial College London"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.C.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56431009900": {"Name": "House I.G.", "AuthorID": "56431009900", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center"}, "7005668641": {"Name": "Trapani J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005668641", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center"}, "6701564925": {"Name": "Voskoboinik I.", "AuthorID": "6701564925", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center"}, "6602521198": {"Name": "Panoskaltsis N.", "AuthorID": "6602521198", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Imperial College London"}, "24469019700": {"Name": "Sohal M.", "AuthorID": "24469019700", "AffiliationID": "60027887", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Ealing Hospital"}}}
