In this contribution, AMO [Mg3Al(OH)8](CO3) 0.5 \u00b7yH2O LDH-oxidized carbon nanotube (AMO-LDH-OCNT) hybrids are shown to perform better than the equivalent pure AMO-LDH. A synergistic effect between the AMO-LDH and OCNT was observed; this endows the hybrid material with enhanced flame retardancy, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. The thermal stability of polypropylene (PP) was significantly enhanced by adding AMO-LDH-OCNT hybrids. For PP mixed with AMO-LDH-OCNT hybrids to produce a composite with 10 wt% LDH and 2 wt% OCNT, the 50% weight loss temperature was increased by 43 \u00b0C. Further, a system with 10 wt% of AMO-LDH and 1 wt% OCNT showed a peak heat release rate (PHRR) reduction of 40%, greater than the PHRR reduction with PP/20 wt% AMO-LDH (31%). The degree of dispersion (mixability) between AMO-LDH and OCNT has a significant effect on the flame retardant performance of the hybrids. In addition, the incorporation of AMO-LDH-OCNT hybrids led to better mechanical properties, such as higher tensile strength (27.5 MPa) and elongation at break (17.9%), than those composites containing only AMO-LDH (25.6 MPa and 7.5%, respectively).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992107674", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55587935800": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "55587935800", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57212450117": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57212450117", "AffiliationID": "60006782", "AffiliationName": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing Forestry University"}, "57141045700": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "57141045700", "AffiliationID": "60006782", "AffiliationName": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing Forestry University"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7101777072": {"Name": "O'Hare D.", "AuthorID": "7101777072", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
