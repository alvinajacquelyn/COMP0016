All such methods are based on the principle of reactive listening of periodic \"fire\" or \"pulse\" broadcasts: each node updates the time of its fire message broadcasts based on received fire messages from some of the remaining nodes sharing the given spectrum. In this paper, we present a novel framework to estimate the required iterations for convergence to fair TDMA scheduling. Our estimates are fundamentally different from previous conjectures or bounds found in the literature as, for the first time, convergence to TDMA is defined in a stochastic sense. Our analytic results apply to the DESYNC algorithm and to pulse-coupled oscillator algorithms with inhibitory coupling. The experimental evaluation via iMote2 TinyOS nodes (based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard) as well as via computer simulations demonstrates that, for the vast majority of settings, our stochastic model is within one standard deviation from the experimentally-observed convergence iterations. The proposed estimates are thus shown to characterize the desynchronization convergence iterations significantly better than existing conjectures or bounds. Therefore, they contribute towards the analytic understanding of how a desynchronization-based system is expected to evolve from random initial conditions to the desynchronized steady state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Desynchronization", "Pulse coupled oscillators", "Stochastic modeling", "TDMA", "Wireless sensor networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clock Synchronization", "Desynchronization", "Experimental evaluation", "IEEE 802.15.4 standards", "Inhibitory coupling", "Pulse coupled oscillators", "Random initial conditions", "Time division multiple accesses (TDMA)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916882766", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55279780900": {"Name": "Buranapanichkit D.", "AuthorID": "55279780900", "AffiliationID": "60006314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Prince of Songkla University"}, "14026659500": {"Name": "Deligiannis N.", "AuthorID": "14026659500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57207530477": {"Name": "Andreopoulos Y.", "AuthorID": "57207530477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
