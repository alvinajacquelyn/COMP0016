This annual workshop brings together international experts to discuss research, advances in clinical implementation as well as problems and challenges in 4D treatment planning, mainly in spot scanned proton therapy. In the last two years several aspects like treatment planning, beam delivery, Monte Carlo simulations, motion modeling and monitoring, QA phantoms as well as 4D imaging were thoroughly discussed. This report provides an overview of discussed topics, recent findings and literature review from the last two years. Its main focus is to highlight translation of 4D research into clinical practice and to discuss remaining challenges and pitfalls that still need to be addressed and to be overcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["4D dosimetry", "4D imaging", "Moving targets", "Proton therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography", "Monte Carlo Method", "Movement", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054385785", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35108472800": {"Name": "Trnkov\u00e1 P.", "AuthorID": "35108472800", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus MC"}, "36025384800": {"Name": "Kn\u00e4usl B.", "AuthorID": "36025384800", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60121828, 60026929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Medical Radiation Physics, Christian Doppler Laboratory for Medical Radiation Research for Radiation Oncology, Medical University of Vienna/AKH Vienna"}, "36466360500": {"Name": "Furtado H.", "AuthorID": "36466360500", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60121828, 60026929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Medical Radiation Physics, Christian Doppler Laboratory for Medical Radiation Research for Radiation Oncology, Medical University of Vienna/AKH Vienna"}, "26655217300": {"Name": "Actis O.", "AuthorID": "26655217300", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "56047668900": {"Name": "Boehlen T.T.", "AuthorID": "56047668900", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "20435731200": {"Name": "Bert C.", "AuthorID": "20435731200", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "9839057700": {"Name": "Biegun A.K.", "AuthorID": "9839057700", "AffiliationID": "60022324, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "KVI-Center for Advanced Radiation Technology, University of Groningen"}, "8757124700": {"Name": "McClelland J.", "AuthorID": "8757124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Dept.
