This article presented a small-scale experimental investigation on the pressure response and phase transition of supercritical CO2 release from a pressurized pipeline with a relief orifice. High-frequency transducers and thermocouples were used to measure the evolution of CO2 pressures and temperatures at different locations after release. The results indicated that pressures at different locations decreased nearly synchronously after release. No vapour bubble and pressure rebound generated in larger scale release experiments were found in our small-scale release experiments. The depressurization rate was greatly affected by the phase transition. During the release process, the supercritical CO2 firstly turned into an unstable gas with a very great depressurization rate, then changed into the gas\u2013liquid phase with a lower depressurization rate, and finally changed into gaseous CO2. The larger the relief diameter was, the longer the gas\u2013liquid phase state lasted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["phase transition", "pressure response", "small-scale pipeline", "supercritical CO2 release"], "IndexKeywords": ["Depressurization rate", "Experimental investigations", "High frequency transducers", "Pressure response", "Release experiments", "Small scale", "Supercritical carbon dioxides", "Supercritical CO2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046290748", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"]], "AuthorData": {"57220920094": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "57220920094", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57198508912": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "57198508912", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "8681462700": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "8681462700", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Machinery and Safety, Dalian University of Technology"}, "23033795700": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "23033795700", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}, "7003505415": {"Name": "Mahgerefteh H.", "AuthorID": "7003505415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
