To model complex and non-differentiable functions, these smoothness assumptions are often too restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is to find a different representation of the data by introducing a feature space. This feature space is often learned in an unsupervised way, which might lead to data representations that are not useful for the overall regression task. In this paper, we propose Manifold Gaussian Processes, a novel supervised method that jointly learns a transformation of the data into a feature space and a GP regression from the feature space to observed space. The Manifold GP is a full GP and allows to learn data representations, which are useful for the overall regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on complex non-smooth functions where standard GPs perform poorly, such as step functions and robotics tasks with contacts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Covariance function", "Data representations", "Gaussian process", "Gaussian Processes", "Non-differentiable functions", "Non-smooth functions", "Proof of concept", "Supervised methods"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007236656", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"55418579600": {"Name": "Calandra R.", "AuthorID": "55418579600", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"}, "35248912800": {"Name": "Peters J.", "AuthorID": "35248912800", "AffiliationID": "60030569", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems"}, "7103365199": {"Name": "Rasmussen C.", "AuthorID": "7103365199", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "24922891000": {"Name": "Deisenroth M.", "AuthorID": "24922891000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}}}
