The screen protectors were shown to be effective against Escherichia coli and an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, EMRSA-16 under white light conditions. UV-vis spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the principal light activated antimicrobial agent present was crystal violet. The antibacterial screen protectors represent a simple and inexpensive means by which microbial contamination of mobile phone and tablet computer screens may be reduced in healthcare and non-healthcare environments, where device cleaning compliance has been shown to be very low.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial materials", "E. coli", "Light activated antimicrobial agents", "Mobile telephone", "Photodynamic therapy", "S. aureus", "Surface disinfection", "Tablet computer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907970059", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"19337695800": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "19337695800", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55869165300": {"Name": "Correia A.", "AuthorID": "55869165300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, UCL Department of Chemistry"}, "55547112955": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "55547112955", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
