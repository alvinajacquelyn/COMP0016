Increasingly, patient surveys that traditionally used postal questionnaires are incorporating an online response option. However, the characteristics and experience ratings of online responders are poorly understood. Objective: We sought to examine predictors of postal or online response mode, and associations with patient experience in the (English) Cancer Patient Experience Survey. Methods: We analyzed data from 71,186 patients with cancer recently treated in National Health Service hospitals who responded to the Cancer Patient Experience Survey 2015. Using logistic regression, we explored patient characteristics associated with greater probability of online response and whether, after adjustment for patient characteristics, the online response was associated with a more or less critical evaluation of cancer care compared to the postal response. Results: Of the 63,134 patients included in the analysis, 4635 (7.34%) responded online. In an adjusted analysis, male (women vs men: odds ratio [OR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.54), younger (<55 vs 65-74 years: OR 3.49, 95% CI 3.21-3.80), least deprived (most vs least deprived quintile: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.51-0.64), and nonwhite (nonwhite vs white ethnic group: OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24-1.51) patients were more likely to respond online. Compared to postal responders, after adjustment for patient characteristics, online responders had a higher likelihood of reporting an overall satisfied experience of care (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.32). For 34 of 49 other items, online responders more frequently reported a less than positive experience of care (8 reached statistical significance), and the associations were positive for the remaining 15 of 49 items (2 reached statistical significance). Conclusions: In the context of a national survey of patients with cancer, online and postal responders tend to differ in their characteristics and rating of satisfaction. Associations between online response and reported experience were generally small and mostly nonsignificant, but with a tendency toward less than positive ratings, although not consistently. Whether the observed associations between response mode and reported experience were causal needs to be examined using experimental survey designs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Experience", "Internet", "Online response", "Patient survey", "Satisfaction", "Web"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Patient Satisfaction", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065546287", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57193678428": {"Name": "Pham T.M.", "AuthorID": "57193678428", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare and Outcomes Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare and Outcomes Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57202757335": {"Name": "Abel G.A.", "AuthorID": "57202757335", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care), University of Exeter"}, "57208682327": {"Name": "Gomez-Cano M.", "AuthorID": "57208682327", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care), University of Exeter"}}}
