The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..Most Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) reported to date have been identified by their high peak luminosities and spectra lacking obvious signs of hydrogen. We demonstrate that these events can be distinguished from normal-luminosity SNe (including Type Ic events) solely from their spectra over a wide range of light-curve phases. We use this distinction to select 19 SLSNe-I and four possible SLSNe-I from the Palomar Transient Factory archive (including seven previously published objects). We present 127 new spectra of these objects and combine these with 39 previously published spectra, and we use these to discuss the average spectral properties of SLSNe-I at different spectral phases. We find that Mn ii most probably contributes to the ultraviolet spectral features after maximum light, and we give a detailed study of the O ii features that often characterize the early-time optical spectra of SLSNe-I. We discuss the velocity distribution of O ii, finding that for some SLSNe-I this can be confined to a narrow range compared to relatively large systematic velocity shifts. Mg ii and Fe ii favor higher velocities than O ii and C ii, and we briefly discuss how this may constrain power-source models. We tentatively group objects by how well they match either SN 2011ke or PTF12dam and discuss the possibility that physically distinct events may have been previously grouped together under the SLSN-I label.", "AuthorKeywords": ["supernovae: general"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044069907", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7004044482": {"Name": "Quimby R.M.", "AuthorID": "7004044482", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (WPI), University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study, University of Tokyo"}, "56986400300": {"Name": "Cia A.D.", "AuthorID": "56986400300", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57202625950": {"Name": "Gal-Yam A.", "AuthorID": "57202625950", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "24758926800": {"Name": "Leloudas G.", "AuthorID": "24758926800", "AffiliationID": "60017041, 60095454, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"}, "12751973300": {"Name": "Perley D.A.", "AuthorID": "12751973300", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Research Institute, Liverpool John Moores University, IC2, Liverpool Science Park"}, "36675275900": {"Name": "Lunnan R.", "AuthorID": "36675275900", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "57203365088": {"Name": "Yan L.", "AuthorID": "57203365088", "AffiliationID": "60031581, 60000275", "AffiliationName": "Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology"}, "8896448600": {"Name": "Kasliwal M.M.", "AuthorID": "8896448600", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "35812380700": {"Name": "Kleiser I.K.W.", "AuthorID": "35812380700", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "35395323300": {"Name": "Kulkarni S.R.", "AuthorID": "35395323300", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "7003934710": {"Name": "Vreeswijk P.M.", "AuthorID": "7003934710", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Faculty of Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "24475636900": {"Name": "Yaron O.", "AuthorID": "24475636900", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Faculty of Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57203197744": {"Name": "Bloom J.S.", "AuthorID": "57203197744", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of California"}, "34568722000": {"Name": "Filippenko A.V.", "AuthorID": "34568722000", "AffiliationID": "60025038, 60104840", "AffiliationName": "Miller Senior Fellow, Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California"}, "7004614529": {"Name": "Nugent P.E.", "AuthorID": "7004614529", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "26536688300": {"Name": "Silverman J.M.", "AuthorID": "26536688300", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas"}, "35267985000": {"Name": "Cenko S.B.", "AuthorID": "35267985000", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Joint Space-Science Institute, University of Maryland"}, "7202378679": {"Name": "Cooke J.", "AuthorID": "7202378679", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203029615": {"Name": "Matheson T.", "AuthorID": "57203029615", "AffiliationID": "60015560", "AffiliationName": "National Optical Astronomy Observatory"}, "57213376291": {"Name": "Pan Y.C.", "AuthorID": "57213376291", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California"}, "43361855800": {"Name": "Sternberg A.", "AuthorID": "43361855800", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Observatoire Astronomique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e9ve"}, "24759319300": {"Name": "Sullivan M.", "AuthorID": "24759319300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton"}}}
