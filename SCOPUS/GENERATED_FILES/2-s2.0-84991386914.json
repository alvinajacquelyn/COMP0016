{"Title": "Smoking, second-hand smoke exposure and smoking cessation in relation to leukocyte telomere length and mortality", "Year": 2016, "Source": "Oncotarget", "Volume": "7", "Issue": 37, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 60419, "PageEnd": 60431, "CitedBy": 15, "DOI": "10.18632/oncotarget.11051", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84991386914&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the link between smoking exposure, telomere length and mortality, with emphasis on second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure and the duration of smoking cessation. Results: A total of 1,018 participants died during follow-up (mean: 10.3 years). A 50 base-pair decrease in LTL was shown among cotinine-confirmed current versus never smokers. The 90th quantile of LTL decreased with increasing cotinine among never smokers, indicating a role of SHS. Longer telomeres with smoking cessation were indicated but limited to a 3-16 year period of abstaining smoking. When assessing mortality, we observed a lower risk of all-cause death for the second quintile compared to the first among never smokers (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52-0.87), and a higher risk was found among current smokers (HR: 1.89, 1.19-2.92). Materials and Methods: We studied 6,456 nationally representative U.S. respondents with mortality follow-up through to 31 December 2011. Smoking status was assessed by interviews and cotinine levels. Relative leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multivariable linear regression was performed to examine LTL by smoking exposure, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. We further estimated the association of LTL with cotinine levels using quantile regression, and with smoking cessation dynamics. Cox regression was used to estimate mortality by smoking status and LTL. Conclusion: Our findings indicated a complex association between smoking, telomere length, and mortality. LTL alterations with SHS and smoking cessation warrant further investigation for translation to public health measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Second-hand smoke exposure", "Smoking", "Smoking cessation", "Telomere"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging, Premature", "Cigarette Smoking", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Leukocytes", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Smoking Cessation", "Survival Analysis", "Telomere Homeostasis", "Tobacco Smoke Pollution", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991386914", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"55372637900": {"Name": "Wulaningsih W.", "AuthorID": "55372637900", "AffiliationID": "116697439", "AffiliationName": "PILAR Research and Education"}, "56185407500": {"Name": "Watkins J.", "AuthorID": "56185407500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Mathematical and Molecular Biomedicine, King's College London"}, "57191525312": {"Name": "Serrano F.", "AuthorID": "57191525312", "AffiliationID": "60071491, 60089594", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of The Philippines Diliman"}, "6507275614": {"Name": "Utarini A.", "AuthorID": "6507275614", "AffiliationID": "60069380", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Policy and Management, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada"}, "55909780800": {"Name": "Matsuguchi T.", "AuthorID": "55909780800", "AffiliationID": "101901974", "AffiliationName": "Driver Group, L.L.C."}}}
