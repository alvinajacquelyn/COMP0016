Here, we describe this new course, outline its key components and provide recommendations for others considering implementing a similar FilmMakers-style course using feedback from course tutors and students. We discuss successful and less successful teaching techniques as well as use our experience to identify areas that science students in particular often have difficulties: finding an interesting 'hook' for the video, imagining creative B-roll and making a succinct video by removing extraneous (though usually correct and often interesting) material. The course has two major components: workshop sessions in which students learn the key elements of film-making and independent video production where PFM students partner with senior PhD or post-doc researchers to produce a video on their research. This partnership with the department means that the videos produced serve not only as interesting 'edutainment' to encourage teenagers and young adults into Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths subjects, but also provide valuable outreach for the academic department.", "AuthorKeywords": ["communication", "film-making", "outreach", "project work", "research-based education", "transferable skills"], "IndexKeywords": ["Academic department", "Film making", "outreach", "Project work", "Science communicators", "Scientific researches", "Teaching techniques", "Transferable skills"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040346551", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57200226059": {"Name": "Coates R.", "AuthorID": "57200226059", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57200223162": {"Name": "Kuhai A.", "AuthorID": "57200223162", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57200226520": {"Name": "Turlej L.", "AuthorID": "57200226520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56743096900": {"Name": "Rivlin T.", "AuthorID": "56743096900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "26423856700": {"Name": "McKemmish L.", "AuthorID": "26423856700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
