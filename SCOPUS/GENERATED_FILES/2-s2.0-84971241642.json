A comparative simulation model was built for this purpose. Life-cycle assessment methodology was used to embrace impacts not only from operation (e.g. pumping energy) but also from building the system (e.g. materials, their transportation, etc.). This analysis is essential to improve Mexico City\u2019s water management. The city\u2019s aquifer is overexploited, which has caused land subsidence; the city is prone to flooding for being located in an endorheic basin and highly urbanised; it consumes 1.23 kWh/m3 to supply water to the municipal grid (65 % of it to import 18 % of its water demand from neighbouring basins); and between 30 % and 50 % of this water is lost through grid leakages. The model was used to analyse eleven different types of buildings. Results proved that rainwater harvesting can reduce greenhouse gases emissions in Mexico City and three of the four harvesting scenarios also aid at mitigating flooding risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Energy consumption", "Flood mitigation", "Life-cycle assessment", "Rainwater harvesting", "Water management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Comparative simulation", "Flood mitigation", "Greenhouse gases emissions", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Pumping energies", "Rain water harvesting", "Rainwater harvesting system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971241642", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57189470089": {"Name": "Valdez M.C.", "AuthorID": "57189470089", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering Department, University College London"}, "54925503800": {"Name": "Adler I.", "AuthorID": "54925503800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering Department, University College London"}, "12803419900": {"Name": "Barrett M.", "AuthorID": "12803419900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "57189467347": {"Name": "Ochoa R.", "AuthorID": "57189467347", "AffiliationID": "116728167", "AffiliationName": "Mario Molina Centre for Strategic Studies on Energy and Environment"}, "57189467275": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez A.", "AuthorID": "57189467275", "AffiliationID": "116728167", "AffiliationName": "Mario Molina Centre for Strategic Studies on Energy and Environment"}}}
