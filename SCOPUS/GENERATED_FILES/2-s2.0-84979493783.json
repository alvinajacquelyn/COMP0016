When assessing the overall security of a mobile system, it is important to assess the security risks posed by each mobile applications (apps), thus gaining a stronger understanding of any vulnerabilities present. This paper aims at developing a three-layer framework that assesses the potential risks which apps introduce within the Android mobile systems. A Bayesian risk graphical model is proposed to evaluate risk propagation in a layered risk architecture. By integrating static analysis, dynamic analysis, and behavior analysis in a hierarchical framework, the risks and their propagation through each layer are well modeled by the Bayesian risk graph, which can quantitatively analyze risks faced to both apps and mobile systems. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian risk graph model offers a novel way to investigate the security risks in mobile environment and enables users and administrators to evaluate the potential risks. This strategy allows to strengthen both app security as well as the security of the entire system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Android malware", "Bayesian risks graphs", "mobile security", "risk assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavior analysis", "GraphicaL model", "Hierarchical bayesian", "Hierarchical Bayesian networks", "Mobile applications", "Mobile environments", "Risk propagation", "Three layer frameworks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979493783", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24366415400": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "24366415400", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "Computing, Network, and Security Group, School of Computing, Edinburgh Napier University"}, "57189249946": {"Name": "Russell G.", "AuthorID": "57189249946", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "Computing, Network, and Security Group, School of Computing, Edinburgh Napier University"}, "23006808300": {"Name": "Tryfonas T.", "AuthorID": "23006808300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, Bristol Cryptography Group, University of Bristol"}, "55598108100": {"Name": "Andriotis P.", "AuthorID": "55598108100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Information Security Group, University College London"}}}
