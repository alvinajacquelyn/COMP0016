This issue may be freely reproduce.Background: The optimal corticosteroid regimen for treating the presenting episode of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) remains uncertain. Most UK centres use an 8-week regimen, despite previous systematic reviews indicating that longer regimens reduce the risk of relapse and frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS). Objectives: The primary objective was to determine whether or not an extended 16-week course of prednisolone increases the time to first relapse. The secondary objectives were to compare the relapse rate, FRNS and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) rates, requirement for alternative immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroid-related adverse events (AEs), including adverse behaviour and costs. Design: Randomised double-blind parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, including a cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting: One hundred and twenty-five UK paediatric departments. Participants: Two hundred and thirty-seven children presenting with a first episode of SSNS. Participants aged between 1 and 15 years were randomised (1: 1) according to a minimisation algorithm to ensure balance of ethnicity (South Asian, white or other) and age (\u2264 5or\u2265 6 years). Interventions: The control group (n = 118) received standard course (SC) prednisolone therapy: 60 mg/m2/day of prednisolone in weeks 1\u20134, 40 mg/m2 of prednisolone on alternate days in weeks 5\u20138 and matching placebo on alternate days in weeks 9\u201318 (total 2240 mg/m2). The intervention group (n = 119) received extended course (EC) prednisolone therapy: 60 mg/m2/day of prednisolone in weeks 1\u20134; started at 60 mg/m2 of prednisolone on alternate days in weeks 5\u201316, tapering by 10 mg/m2 every 2 weeks (total 3150 mg/m2). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was time to first relapse [Albustix\u00ae (Siemens Healthcare Limited, Frimley, UK)-positive proteinuria +++ or greater for 3 consecutive days or the presence of generalised oedema plus +++ proteinuria]. The secondary outcome measures were relapse rate,incidence of FRNS and SDNS, other immunosuppressive therapy use, rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs and the incidence of behavioural change [using Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (ACBC)]. A comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. The analysis was by intention to treat. Participants were followed for a minimum of 24 months. Results: There was no significant difference in time to first relapse between the SC and EC groups (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.17; log-rank p = 0.3). There were also no differences in the incidence of FRNS (SC 50% vs. EC 53%; p = 0.7), SDNS (44% vs. 42%; p = 0.8) or requirement for other immunosuppressive therapy (56% vs. 54%; p = 0.8). The total prednisolone dose received following completion of study medication was 5475 mg vs. 6674 mg (p = 0.07). SAE rates were not significantly different (25% vs. 17%; p = 0.1) and neither were AEs, except poor behaviour (yes/no), which was less frequent with EC treatment. There were no differences in ACBC scores. EC therapy was associated with a mean increase in generic health benefit [0.0162 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and cost savings (\u00a34369 vs. \u00a32696). Limitations: Study drug formulation may have prevented some younger children who were unable to swallow whole or crushed tablets from participating. Conclusions: This trial has not shown any clinical benefit for EC prednisolone therapy in UK children. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that EC therapy may be cheaper, with the possibility of a small QALY benefit. Future work: Studies investigating EC versus SC therapy in younger children and further cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infant", "Male", "Nephrotic Syndrome", "Prednisolone", "Recurrence", "Standard of Care", "Technology Assessment, Biomedical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067102023", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"7102172274": {"Name": "Webb N.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102172274", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60023969, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "56354791000": {"Name": "Woolley R.L.", "AuthorID": "56354791000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56001454200": {"Name": "Brettell E.A.", "AuthorID": "56001454200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "57200007168": {"Name": "Barsoum E.N.", "AuthorID": "57200007168", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7003439441": {"Name": "Ives N.J.", "AuthorID": "7003439441", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56789825700": {"Name": "Lambe T.", "AuthorID": "56789825700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "6701631888": {"Name": "Frew E.", "AuthorID": "6701631888", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7004400751": {"Name": "Trompeter R.S.", "AuthorID": "7004400751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College"}, "54790511200": {"Name": "Cummins C.", "AuthorID": "54790511200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "55620170800": {"Name": "Wheatley K.", "AuthorID": "55620170800", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}}}
