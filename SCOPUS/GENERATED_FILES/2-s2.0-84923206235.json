To address this issue, modified ECG interpretation criteria have become available for use within athletes. Objective This study assessed the accuracy of the new 2014 'Refined Criteria' against the 2013 Seattle Criteria and the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations in a cohort of Arabic, black and Caucasian athletes. Methods 2491 male athletes (1367 Arabic, 748 black and 376 Caucasian) undertook pre-participation screening including a 12-lead ECG, with further investigation(s) upon indication. Results Ten athletes (0.4%) were identified with cardiac pathology; seven with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM; five black and two Arabic) and three Arabs with Wolff-Parkinson -White syndrome (WPW). All three ECG criteria were 100% sensitive identifying all cases of HCM and WPW. The 2014 Refined Criteria reduced (p<0.0001) the prevalence of an abnormal ECG to 5.3% vs 11.6% (Seattle Criteria) and 22.3% (2010 ESC recommendations). The 2014 Refined Criteria significantly (p<0.0001) improved specificity (94.0%) across all ethnicities compared with the Seattle Criteria (87.5%) and ESC recommendations (76.6%). Black athletes continue to present a higher prevalence (p<0.0001) of abnormal ECGs compared with Arabic and Caucasian athletes (10% vs 3.6% and 2.1%). Conclusions The 2014 Re fined Criteria for athlete ECG interpretation outperformed both the 2013 Seattle Criteria and the 2010 ESC recommendations by significantly reducing the number of false-positive ECGs in Arabic, black and Caucasian athletes while maintaining 100% sensitivity for serious cardiac pathologies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Athletes", "Continental Population Groups", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Electrocardiography", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923206235", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55480814500": {"Name": "Riding N.R.", "AuthorID": "55480814500", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "49963302800": {"Name": "Farooq A.", "AuthorID": "49963302800", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Athlete Health and Performance Research Centre, ASPETAR, Qatar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "25825824400": {"Name": "Wilson M.G.", "AuthorID": "25825824400", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "ASPETAR, Qatar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "7006381097": {"Name": "Whyte G.P.", "AuthorID": "7006381097", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "26643531900": {"Name": "George K.P.", "AuthorID": "26643531900", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "55290456300": {"Name": "Sheikh N.", "AuthorID": "55290456300", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, St Georges University of London"}, "7405877896": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "7405877896", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, St Georges University of London"}, "23102287200": {"Name": "Adamuz C.", "AuthorID": "23102287200", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Medicine, ASPETAR, Qatar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "57189668043": {"Name": "Watt V.", "AuthorID": "57189668043", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Medicine, ASPETAR, Qatar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "6601959986": {"Name": "Drezner J.A.", "AuthorID": "6601959986", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington"}}}
