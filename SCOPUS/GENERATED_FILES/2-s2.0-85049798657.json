Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow their total processing capacity with the number of validators; and those that do, compromise security or decentralization. We present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that preserves longterm security under permissionless operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards. OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and low-latency 'trust-but-verify' validation for low-value transactions. An evaluation of our experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of active validators, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atomix", "blockchain", "Byzantine Fault Tolerant", "ByzCoinX", "cross shard", "decentralization", "distributed ledger", "ledger pruning", "randomness", "scalable", "sharding", "state blocks", "trust but verify"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomix", "Byzantine fault", "ByzCoinX", "cross shard", "decentralization", "distributed ledger", "ledger pruning", "randomness", "scalable", "sharding", "state blocks", "Trust-but-verify"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049798657", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57192074499": {"Name": "Kokoris-Kogias E.", "AuthorID": "57192074499", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "55104237200": {"Name": "Jovanovic P.", "AuthorID": "55104237200", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "8881533600": {"Name": "Gasser L.", "AuthorID": "8881533600", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "57191164748": {"Name": "Gailly N.", "AuthorID": "57191164748", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "36791913700": {"Name": "Ford B.", "AuthorID": "36791913700", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "36006638900": {"Name": "Syta E.", "AuthorID": "36006638900", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity College"}}}
