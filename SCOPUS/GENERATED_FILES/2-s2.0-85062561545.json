This article proposes a conceptualisation of the urban nexus as the contingent product of the operation of physical, ecological and social processes around urban technologies in a specific location. The article focuses on the configuration of the nexus within particular trajectories of urban development, and the wider consequences of these trajectories for urban life. The strategy of the article is to examine the water-energy nexus within a particular infrastructure landscape, that is, as it emerges from the historical co-evolution of social practices and the built environment. Such co-evolution can be described as an urban trajectory that reveals the consolidation of different aspects of the nexus at varying levels from the household to the extra-urban connections that shape the city. This perspective is applied to analyse processes of infrastructure development in the city of Bangalore, India, since the completion of the first works to establish a water network and the electrification of the city at the beginning of the 20th century. The analysis reveals a historically built and context-dependent nexus that reflects the interconnectedness of the mechanisms of infrastructure governance and urban inequality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bengaluru", "energy-water nexus", "inequality", "service provision", "urban trajectories"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062561545", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"26321347500": {"Name": "Cast\u00e1n Broto V.", "AuthorID": "26321347500", "AffiliationID": "60176591, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Urban Institute, Interdisciplinary Centre of the Social Sciences (ICOSS), University of Sheffield"}, "6504411069": {"Name": "Sudhira H.S.", "AuthorID": "6504411069", "AffiliationID": "112420047", "AffiliationName": "Gubbi Labs"}}}
