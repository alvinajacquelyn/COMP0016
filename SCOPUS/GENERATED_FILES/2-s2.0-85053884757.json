Among them, region-based fully convolutional networks (R-FCN) and deformable convolutional nets (DCN) can improve CAD for mammography: R-FCN optimizes for speed and low consumption of memory, which is crucial for processing the high resolutions of to 50 \u03bc m used by radiologists. Deformable convolution and pooling can model a wide range of mammographic findings of different morphology and scales, thanks to their versatility. In this study, we present a neural net architecture based on R-FCN/DCN, that we have adapted from the natural image domain to suit mammograms\u2014particularly their larger image size\u2014without compromising resolution. We trained the network on a large, recently released dataset (Optimam) including 6,500 cancerous mammograms. By combining our modern architecture with such a rich dataset, we achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.879 for breast-wise detection in the DREAMS challenge (130,000 withheld images), which surpassed all other submissions in the competitive phase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Area under the ROC curve", "Convolutional networks", "Learning methods", "Low consumption", "Mammography cads", "Modern architectures", "NET architecture", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053884757", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57203984547": {"Name": "Morrell S.", "AuthorID": "57203984547", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191072718": {"Name": "Wojna Z.", "AuthorID": "57191072718", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203994717": {"Name": "Khoo C.", "AuthorID": "57203994717", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35117674500": {"Name": "Iglesias J.", "AuthorID": "35117674500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}}}
