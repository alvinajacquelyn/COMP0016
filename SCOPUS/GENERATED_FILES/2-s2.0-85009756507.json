Our extraction method utilizes an improved pre-leaching procedure that reduces the likelihood of contamination from matrix-bound sulfur. Data generated with the improved extraction method show CAS \u03b434S as much as 12\u2030 higher (34S-enriched) than previously reported which suggests a reevaluation of the phenomenon of \u2018superheavy\u2019 pyrite. The average \u03b434S of seawater sulfate increases from 30 to 38\u2030 in the lower Nama Group, and we correlate this rise in \u03b434S among contemporaneous marine basins. Global seawater sulfate \u03b434S >35\u2030 is highly unusual in Earth history, and in the terminal Ediacaran is best explained by a high pyrite burial flux. Pyrite in the Nama Group is close in isotopic composition to coeval sulfate, but the sulfur isotope fractionation between sulfate and pyrite varies widely among different studied basins, suggesting highly heterogeneous redox and depositional conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbonate-associated sulfate", "Ediacaran", "Method development", "Neoproterozoic", "Sulfur isotopes", "Superheavy pyrite"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009756507", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56230177600": {"Name": "Tostevin R.", "AuthorID": "56230177600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57190178443": {"Name": "He T.", "AuthorID": "57190178443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "14626549300": {"Name": "Shields G.", "AuthorID": "14626549300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7801338345": {"Name": "Turchyn A.", "AuthorID": "7801338345", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "36993014600": {"Name": "Antler G.", "AuthorID": "36993014600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "7404053441": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "7404053441", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56229750300": {"Name": "Penny A.", "AuthorID": "56229750300", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56229681700": {"Name": "Bowyer F.", "AuthorID": "56229681700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
