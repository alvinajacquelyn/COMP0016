Even as the explosion of available genome sequences and associated genome-scale data continues apace, the sustainability of professionally maintained biological databases is under threat due to policy changes by major funding agencies. Here, we focus on model organism databases to demonstrate the myriad ways in which biological databases not only act as repositories but actively facilitate advances in research. We present data that show that reducing financial support to model organism databases could prove to be not just scientifically, but also economically, unsound.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Databases, Genetic", "Genome, Fungal", "Genomics", "Molecular Biology", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Schizosaccharomyces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978055812", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7202287996": {"Name": "Oliver S.", "AuthorID": "7202287996", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Systems Biology Centre and Department of Biochemistry"}, "7404205832": {"Name": "Harris M.", "AuthorID": "7404205832", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Systems Biology Centre and Department of Biochemistry"}, "7102296936": {"Name": "Wood V.", "AuthorID": "7102296936", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Systems Biology Centre and Department of Biochemistry"}, "55250729700": {"Name": "Lock A.", "AuthorID": "55250729700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, and UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing"}, "7101733795": {"Name": "Nurse P.", "AuthorID": "7101733795", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
