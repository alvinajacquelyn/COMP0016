In these cases, a post-mortem examination is required to elucidate the cause of death and is regarded as the \u2018gold standard\u2019. However, in circumstances of certain religious/cultural beliefs and advanced body decomposition an alternative non-invasive approach would be preferred. Although a developing field, post-mortem imaging using computed tomography (pmCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (pmMR) provides a non-invasive and accurate alternative to traditional post-mortem in specific circumstances. In particular, pmMR has an important role in younger decedents while pmCT is more suited to examination of adults with SCD. Despite encouraging results from several preliminary studies, more research is needed to determine the most appropriate role for post-mortem imaging in the clinical algorhythm for investigation of SCD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conventional autopsy", "Post-mortem CT", "Post-mortem CT (pmCT)", "Post-mortem imaging", "Post-mortem MR", "Post-mortem MR (pmMR)", "Sudden cardiac death (SCD)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054801505", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"12767242100": {"Name": "Femia G.", "AuthorID": "12767242100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"}, "6603828606": {"Name": "Semsarian C.", "AuthorID": "6603828606", "AffiliationID": "60003524", "AffiliationName": "Agnes Ginges Centre for Molecular Cardiology, Centenary Institute"}, "7202376484": {"Name": "McGuire M.", "AuthorID": "7202376484", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"}, "11139015400": {"Name": "Puranik R.", "AuthorID": "11139015400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"}, "50561797900": {"Name": "Raleigh J.", "AuthorID": "50561797900", "AffiliationID": "60018150", "AffiliationName": "Department of RTadiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "56355465200": {"Name": "Langlois N.", "AuthorID": "56355465200", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Anatomy and Physiology, University of Adelaide"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
