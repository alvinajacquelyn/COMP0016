To address this fundamental question, we tested eight recently released force fields against our set of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observables for a complex and medically relevant system, the major factor VIII binding region on the von Willebrand factor. This biomedically important region comprises both a folded and a partially structured domain. By using an enhanced sampling technique (temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations), we find that some force fields indeed rise to the challenge and capture the structural and dynamical features of the NMR ensemble and, therefore, are the appropriate choice for simulations of proteins with partially structured domains. What is more, we show that only such force fields can qualitatively capture the effects of a pathogenic mutation on the structural ensemble.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disordered domains", "Dynamical features", "Dynamical properties", "Enhanced samplings", "Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)", "Pathogenic mutation", "Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations", "Von Willebrand factor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064715531", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"36463799200": {"Name": "Kuzmanic A.", "AuthorID": "36463799200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Maths and Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.L.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57220521396": {"Name": "Pritchard R.B.", "AuthorID": "57220521396", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "25924919300": {"Name": "Hansen D.F.", "AuthorID": "25924919300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
