The functionality and scope of their applications can be broadened considerably by the introduction of metallic nanoparticles into the carbon matrix during preparation or post-synthesis. Here, we report on the use of X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) as a method of imaging graphene sponges after the uptake of metal (silver and iron) nanoparticles. The technique can be used to visualize the inner structure of the graphene sponge in 3D in a non-destructive fashion by providing information on the nanoparticles deposited on the sponge surfaces, both internal and external. Other deposited materials can be imaged in a similar manner providing they return a high enough contrast to the carbon microstructure, which is facilitated by the low atomic mass of carbon.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-microbial activity", "Carbon microstructures", "Carbon structures", "Deposited materials", "Environmental remediation", "Metallic nanoparticles", "Nondestructive tools", "X ray micro-computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070795707", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7501658141": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501658141", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Nano-Electronics Centre, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "57202566890": {"Name": "Mills C.", "AuthorID": "57202566890", "AffiliationID": "60004572, 60003430", "AffiliationName": "Metallic and Functional Coatings Group, Surface Engineering Department, Tata Steel, Research Development and Technology, Talbot Building, Swansea University"}, "35207001100": {"Name": "Rhodes R.", "AuthorID": "35207001100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Nano-Electronics Centre, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "6602589117": {"Name": "Stolojan V.", "AuthorID": "6602589117", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Nano-Electronics Centre, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "7203043276": {"Name": "Silva S.", "AuthorID": "7203043276", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Nano-Electronics Centre, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "56186091400": {"Name": "Pani S.", "AuthorID": "56186091400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nuclear and Radiation Physics, Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "57189988046": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "57189988046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57209848408": {"Name": "Pathan T.", "AuthorID": "57209848408", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56595734000": {"Name": "Cooper S.", "AuthorID": "56595734000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
