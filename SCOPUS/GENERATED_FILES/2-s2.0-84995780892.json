State-of-the-art/commercial supports are based on forms of carbon black. However, carbon supports present disadvantages including corrosion in the operating fuel cell environment and loss of catalyst activity. Here we review recent work examining the potential of different varieties of graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as catalyst supports, highlighting their likely benefits, as well as the challenges associated with their implementation. The performance of gCN and hybrid gCN-carbon materials as PEMFC electrodes is discussed, as well as their potential for use in alkaline systems and water electrolyzers. We illustrate the discussion with examples taken from our own recent studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electrocatalyst support materials", "electrolysis", "graphitic carbon nitride", "hydrogen oxidation", "N-doped carbon", "oxygen reduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrocatalyst support", "Graphitic carbon nitrides", "Hydrogen oxidation", "N-doped", "Oxygen Reduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995780892", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"56110194900": {"Name": "Mansor N.", "AuthorID": "56110194900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56029659800": {"Name": "Dedigama I.", "AuthorID": "56029659800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55307742600": {"Name": "Miller T.", "AuthorID": "55307742600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507232041": {"Name": "Br\u00e1zdov\u00e1 V.", "AuthorID": "6507232041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55944154200": {"Name": "Cor\u00e0 F.", "AuthorID": "55944154200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7101707324": {"Name": "McMillan P.", "AuthorID": "7101707324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005222072": {"Name": "Jorge A.", "AuthorID": "7005222072", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55625906100": {"Name": "Jia J.", "AuthorID": "55625906100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "24822495900": {"Name": "Mattevi C.", "AuthorID": "24822495900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56110284600": {"Name": "Gibbs C.", "AuthorID": "56110284600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Business Plc"}, "57210462729": {"Name": "Hodgson D.", "AuthorID": "57210462729", "AffiliationID": "117699138", "AffiliationName": "Amalyst Ltd Faraday Wharf, Innovation Birmingham Campus"}, "7202774632": {"Name": "Howard C.", "AuthorID": "7202774632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}}}
