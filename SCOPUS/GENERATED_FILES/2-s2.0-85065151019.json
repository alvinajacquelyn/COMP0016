The panel of authors was chosen based on their particular interests and previous publications within a specific area of SFEMG or CN-jitter. Each member of the panel was asked to submit a section on their particular area of interest and these submissions were circulated among the panel members for edits and comments. This process continued until a consensus was reached. Donald Sanders and Erik St\u00e5lberg then edited the final document.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fiber density", "Jitter", "Myopathy", "Neuromuscular transmission", "Neuropathy", "Single fiber EMG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Electrodes", "Electromyography", "Humans", "Myofibrils", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065151019", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"35408269300": {"Name": "Sanders D.B.", "AuthorID": "35408269300", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Duke University Medical Center"}, "7006037450": {"Name": "Arimura K.", "AuthorID": "7006037450", "AffiliationID": "60162058, 60028088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences"}, "54978356200": {"Name": "Cui L.Y.", "AuthorID": "54978356200", "AffiliationID": "60008706, 60122781", "AffiliationName": "Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}, "6603706748": {"Name": "Erta\u015f M.", "AuthorID": "6603706748", "AffiliationID": "60012324", "AffiliationName": "Istanbul Faculty of Medicine"}, "7003757290": {"Name": "Farrugia M.E.", "AuthorID": "7003757290", "AffiliationID": "100782426", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "7102783370": {"Name": "Gilchrist J.", "AuthorID": "7102783370", "AffiliationID": "60021399", "AffiliationName": "Southern Illinois University School of Medicine"}, "7006754044": {"Name": "Kouyoumdjian J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006754044", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade Medicina Sao Jose Rio Preto (FAMERP)"}, "57201980080": {"Name": "Padua L.", "AuthorID": "57201980080", "AffiliationID": "60073799, 60031984", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Department of Geriatrics, Neurosciences and Orthopaedics, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"}, "7102280708": {"Name": "Pitt M.", "AuthorID": "7102280708", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology"}, "19436348400": {"Name": "St\u00e5lberg E.", "AuthorID": "19436348400", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Uppsala University"}}}
