Wetherefore examineda cohortof400 randomly selected, atleast 65-year-old inpatients of a general hospital concerning addictive disorders using a well-tested structured clinical interview (DSM-IV-TR-based SKID-I). Nearly one third of this cohort was substance dependent: The 12-month prevalence rate for nicotine was 10.3% and for alcohol dependence 3%, with 24.4% and 66.7%, respectively, being severely dependent. These rates were similar to those foundinthe general German population ofpersons under 65 year of age. A fifth of the cohort was (mostly mildly) dependent on prescription drugs, remarkably including nonopioid analgesics. One case with a previous dependence on gabapentin was identified. Identification and management of addiction disorders should be considered as part of the basic geriatric assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nonopioid analgesics", "Older adults", "Prescription drugs", "SKID-I", "Substance addiction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963799998", "SubjectAreas": [["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57188846019": {"Name": "Cossmann J.", "AuthorID": "57188846019", "AffiliationID": "60014264, 60017529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Medicine, Evangelisches Krankenhaus Castrop-Rauxel, Academic Training Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen"}, "6701701047": {"Name": "Bonnet U.", "AuthorID": "6701701047", "AffiliationID": "60014264, 60017529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Medicine, Evangelisches Krankenhaus Castrop-Rauxel, Academic Training Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen"}, "7004109625": {"Name": "Scherbaum N.", "AuthorID": "7004109625", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Addictive Behavior and Addiction Medicine, LVR-Klinikum Essen Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen"}}}
