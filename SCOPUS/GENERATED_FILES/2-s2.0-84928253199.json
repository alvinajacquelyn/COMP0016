EEGs were graded (normal, mild, moderate, and severe). Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 2 y of age. Seven HRV features were calculated using normalized-RR (NN) interval. The correlation of these features with EEG grade and outcome were measured using Spearman's correlation coefficient.Results:HRV was significantly associated with HIE severity (P < 0.05): standard deviation of NN interval (SDNN) (r =-0.62), triangular interpolation of NN interval histogram (TINN) (r =-0.65), mean NN interval (r =-0.48), and the very low frequency (VLF) (r =-0.60), low frequency (LF) (r =-0.67) and high frequency (HF) components of the NN interval (r =-0.60). SDNN at 24 and 48 h were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with neurodevelopmental outcome (r =-0.41 and-0.54, respectively).Conclusion:HRV is associated with EEG grade of HIE and neurodevelopmental outcome. HRV has potential as a prognostic tool to complement EEG.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Body Temperature", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Electrocardiography", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928253199", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56454959800": {"Name": "Goulding R.", "AuthorID": "56454959800", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "15924307900": {"Name": "Stevenson N.", "AuthorID": "15924307900", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "14058615200": {"Name": "Murray D.", "AuthorID": "14058615200", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "24067510000": {"Name": "Livingstone V.", "AuthorID": "24067510000", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "8656847900": {"Name": "Filan P.", "AuthorID": "8656847900", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Cork University, Maternity Hospital"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}}}
