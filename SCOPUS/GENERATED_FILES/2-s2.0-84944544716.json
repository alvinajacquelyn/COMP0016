Predictive coding theories state that the brain is constantly trying to predict the inputs it receives, and each regionin the cortical sensory hierarchy represents both these predictions and the mismatch between predictions and input (prediction error). In this chapter, we reviewthe extant empirical evidence for this theory, as well as discuss recent theoretical advances. We find that predictive coding provides a good explanation for many phenomena observed in perception, and generates testable hypotheses. Furthermore, we suggest possible avenues for further empirical testing and for broadening the perspective of the role predictive coding may play in cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expectation", "FMRI", "Perception", "Perceptual inference", "Prediction", "Predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944544716", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"54401272500": {"Name": "Kok P.", "AuthorID": "54401272500", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "8567604600": {"Name": "De Lange F.", "AuthorID": "8567604600", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}}}
