All rights reserved.Light-field microscopy (LFM) is a scalable approach for volumetric Ca2+ imaging with high volumetric acquisition rates (up to 100 Hz). Although the technology has enabled whole-brain Ca2+ imaging in semi-transparent specimens, tissue scattering has limited its application in the rodent brain. We introduce seeded iterative demixing (SID), a computational source-extraction technique that extends LFM to the mammalian cortex. SID can capture neuronal dynamics in vivo within a volume of 900 \u00d7 900 \u00d7 260 \u03bcm located as deep as 380 \u03bcm in the mouse cortex or hippocampus at a 30-Hz volume rate while discriminating signals from neurons as close as 20 \u03bcm apart, at a computational cost three orders of magnitude less than that of frame-by-frame image reconstruction. We expect that the simplicity and scalability of LFM, coupled with the performance of SID, will open up a range of applications including closed-loop experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Calcium Signaling", "Female", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microscopy, Video", "Molecular Imaging", "Neurons", "Nimodipine", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026441753", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"16234326300": {"Name": "N\u00f6bauer T.", "AuthorID": "16234326300", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurotechnology and Biophysics, Rockefeller University"}, "57195242561": {"Name": "Weilguny L.", "AuthorID": "57195242561", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurotechnology and Biophysics, Rockefeller University"}, "7003970024": {"Name": "Vaziri A.", "AuthorID": "7003970024", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurotechnology and Biophysics, Rockefeller University"}, "57195237622": {"Name": "Skocek O.", "AuthorID": "57195237622", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}, "57195242163": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez Traub F.", "AuthorID": "57195242163", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}, "6504579818": {"Name": "Pern\u00eda-Andrade A.", "AuthorID": "6504579818", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Neural Systems Institute, Rockefeller University"}, "8324241600": {"Name": "Molodtsov M.", "AuthorID": "8324241600", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Neural Systems Institute, Rockefeller University"}}}
