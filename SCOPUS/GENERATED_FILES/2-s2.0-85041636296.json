This provides evidence for changes over time for a region in the proportions of crops, especially rice versus millets. In addition, the composition of samples, both grouped by period and considered on a sample-by-sample basis, are considered as representing routine crop-processing waste, from which it is suggested that typical patterns of routine crop processing (after storage) can be inferred. These patterns, in turn, imply something about processing prior to storage and the social organization of agricultural production, suggesting the hypothesis that crop-processing patterns diversified during the emergence of complex societies with some sites with larger scale practices while others were focused on the household level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Millet", "Paleoethnobotany", "Rice", "Social complexity", "Storage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041636296", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36118397000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "36118397000", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Center for Archaeological Science, Sichuan University"}, "57200544959": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57200544959", "AffiliationID": "105496721", "AffiliationName": "National Museum of China"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
