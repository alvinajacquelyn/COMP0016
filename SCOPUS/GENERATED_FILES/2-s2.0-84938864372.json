However, its mechanism of action has not yet been established comprehensively. To identify its target genes comprehensively and determine the main routes by which it influences glioblastoma phenotypes, we conducted individualnucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. We confirmed that MSI1 has a preference for UAG sequences contained in a particular structural context, especially in 3= untranslated regions. Although numerous binding sites were also identified in intronic sequences, our RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis does not favor the idea that MSI1 is a major regulator of splicing in glioblastoma cells. MSI1 target mRNAs encode proteins that function in multiple pathways of cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Since these associations indicate potentially new roles for MSI1, we investigated its impact on glioblastoma cell adhesion, morphology, migration, and invasion. These processes are known to underpin the spread and relapse of glioblastoma, in contrast to other tumors where metastasis is the main driver of recurrence and progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Alternative Splicing", "Base Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938864372", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"15046121200": {"Name": "Uren P.", "AuthorID": "15046121200", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Computational Biology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "55510071600": {"Name": "Bahrami-Samani E.", "AuthorID": "55510071600", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Computational Biology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "57203774574": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57203774574", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Computational Biology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "26641624300": {"Name": "Vo D.", "AuthorID": "26641624300", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "55485085500": {"Name": "de Araujo P.", "AuthorID": "55485085500", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "25627443200": {"Name": "Burns S.", "AuthorID": "25627443200", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "7006316381": {"Name": "Qiao M.", "AuthorID": "7006316381", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "37060272400": {"Name": "Abreu R.", "AuthorID": "37060272400", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "56769320600": {"Name": "Correa B.", "AuthorID": "56769320600", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "6602188332": {"Name": "Penalva L.", "AuthorID": "6602188332", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "56770041600": {"Name": "P\u00f6tschke R.", "AuthorID": "56770041600", "AffiliationID": "60019016", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center, Department of Children's Hospital"}, "25723344900": {"Name": "K\u00fchn\u00f6l C.", "AuthorID": "25723344900", "AffiliationID": "60019016", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center, Department of Children's Hospital"}, "36843586800": {"Name": "Nakaya H.", "AuthorID": "36843586800", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56970940200": {"Name": "Martindale J.", "AuthorID": "56970940200", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "13006314400": {"Name": "Abdelmohsen K.", "AuthorID": "13006314400", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "26643133700": {"Name": "Gorospe M.", "AuthorID": "26643133700", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}}}
