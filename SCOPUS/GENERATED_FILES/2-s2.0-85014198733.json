The current approaches use fixed lenses or expensive phased arrays. Here, using a process of analogue-to-digital conversion and wavelet decomposition, we develop the notion of quantal meta-surfaces. The quanta here are small, pre-manufactured three-dimensional units-which we call metamaterial bricks-each encoding a specific phase delay. These bricks can be assembled into meta-surfaces to generate any diffraction-limited acoustic field. We apply this methodology to show experimental examples of acoustic focusing, steering and, after stacking single meta-surfaces into layers, the more complex field of an acoustic tractor beam. We demonstrate experimentally single-sided air-borne acoustic levitation using meta-layers at various bit-rates: from a 4-bit uniform to 3-bit non-uniform quantization in phase. This powerful methodology dramatically simplifies the design of acoustic devices and provides a key-step towards realizing spatial sound modulators.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014198733", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55960652900": {"Name": "Memoli G.", "AuthorID": "55960652900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT Lab, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57191998053": {"Name": "Asakawa M.", "AuthorID": "57191998053", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT Lab, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57204438010": {"Name": "Sahoo D.", "AuthorID": "57204438010", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT Lab, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT Lab, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "22133254300": {"Name": "Caleap M.", "AuthorID": "22133254300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "7006891244": {"Name": "Drinkwater B.", "AuthorID": "7006891244", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bristol"}}}
