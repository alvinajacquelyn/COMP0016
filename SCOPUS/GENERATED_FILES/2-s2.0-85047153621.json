Psychomotor therapy (PMT), a mind-body intervention often applied in Dutch facilities for this target group, uses body awareness and physical activities as a medium to learn how to gain control over one\u2019s anger and reduce aggressive behaviour. With Intervention Mapping as a framework, 17 Dutch psychomotor therapists were asked to describe their PMT programme to investigate its content and coherence. Results suggested that interoceptive awareness (IA) and adaptive coping skills (ACS) are key elements of the PMT programmes. The theoretical basis of the PMT programmes is however limited and specific instruments for evaluating PMT are not available yet, especially for IA. Psychomotor therapists would gain from a well-described PMT programme. Future research is warranted on IA, and specific instruments need to be developed and validated for this target group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggressive behaviour", "anger", "borderline intellectual functioning", "Intervention Mapping", "mild intellectual disabilities", "Psychomotor therapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047153621", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57202092729": {"Name": "Bellemans T.", "AuthorID": "57202092729", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University"}, "55940606200": {"Name": "van Busschbach J.", "AuthorID": "55940606200", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "6701557104": {"Name": "Didden R.", "AuthorID": "6701557104", "AffiliationID": "108442146", "AffiliationName": "Trajectum"}, "56640784800": {"Name": "Visser R.", "AuthorID": "56640784800", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, VU University"}, "55535420500": {"Name": "Schaafsma D.", "AuthorID": "55535420500", "AffiliationID": "60016321", "AffiliationName": "Department Pedagogy, Fontys University of Applied Sciences"}, "57203337878": {"Name": "Totsika V.", "AuthorID": "57203337878", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick"}}}
