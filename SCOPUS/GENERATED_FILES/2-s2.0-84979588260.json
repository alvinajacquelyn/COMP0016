We minimize the effects of Kramers-type recrossings by assigning conformational states based on their sequential time evolution. Transition rates are further estimated from short-time state propagators by maximizing the likelihood that the extracted rates agree with the observed atomistic trajectories without any a priori assumptions about their temperature dependence. Here, we evaluate the rates for both continuous replica trajectories that visit different temperatures and for discontinuous data corresponding to each REMD temperature. While the binding-unbinding kinetic process is clearly Markovian, the conformational dynamics of the bound NNQQ dimer has a complex character. Our kinetic analysis allows us to discriminate between short-lived encounter pairs and strongly bound conformational states. The conformational dynamics of NNQQ dimers supports a kinetically driven aggregation mechanism, in agreement with the polymorphic character reported for amyloid aggregates such as microcrystals and fibrils.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aggregation mechanism", "Coarse Master Equations", "Complex character", "Conformational dynamics", "Conformational state", "Discontinuous data", "Replica exchange molecular dynamics", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979588260", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57190372465": {"Name": "Leahy C.", "AuthorID": "57190372465", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Complex and Adaptive Systems Laboratory, University College Dublin"}, "47961301900": {"Name": "Murphy R.", "AuthorID": "47961301900", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Complex and Adaptive Systems Laboratory, University College Dublin"}, "6602224414": {"Name": "Buchete N.", "AuthorID": "6602224414", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Complex and Adaptive Systems Laboratory, University College Dublin"}, "7006163675": {"Name": "Hummer G.", "AuthorID": "7006163675", "AffiliationID": "60020952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Theoretical Biophysics, Max Planck Institute of Biophysics"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}}}
