The p110? isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is mainly expressed in white blood cells. Here, we have investigated whether p110? PI3K is involved in the pathogenesis of restenosis in a mouse model of carotid injury, which mimics the damage following arterial grafts. We used mice in which p110? kinase activity has been disabled by a knockin (KI) point mutation in its ATP-binding site (p110?D910A/D910A PI3K mice). Wild-type (WT) and p110?D910A/D910A mice were subjected to longitudinal carotid injury. At 14 and 30 days after carotid injury, mice with inactive p110? showed strongly decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells (including T lymphocytes and macrophages) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), compared with WT mice. Likewise, PI-3065, a p110?-selective PI3K inhibitor, almost completely prevented restenosis after artery injury. Our data showed that p110? PI3K plays a main role in promoting neointimal thickening and inflammatory processes during vascular stenosis, with its inhibition providing significant reduction in restenosis following carotid injury. p110?-selective inhibitors, recently approved for the treatment of human B-cell malignancies, therefore, present a new therapeutic opportunity to prevent the restenosis upon artery injury.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carotid Arteries", "Carotid Artery Injuries", "Carotid Stenosis", "Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Inflammation", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neointima", "Point Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033775823", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6602483540": {"Name": "Bilancio A.", "AuthorID": "6602483540", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, University of Campania \u201cL.
