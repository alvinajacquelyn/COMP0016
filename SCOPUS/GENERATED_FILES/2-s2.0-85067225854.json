Here we show that Wnt signal activation in mammalian cells activates intracellular mobilization of connexin 43 (Cx43), which belongs to a gap junction protein family, a new target protein in response to extracellular Wnt signal activation. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the nuclear localization of Cx43 was increased by 8-to 10-fold in Wnt5A-and 9B-treated cells compared with controls; this Wnt-induced increase was negated in the cells where Cx43 and \u03b2-catenin were knocked down using shRNA. There was a significant (P < 0.001) and concomitant depletion of the cell membrane and cytosolic signal of Cx43 in Wnt-treated cells with an increase in the nuclear signal for Cx43; this was more obvious in cells where \u03b2-catenin was knocked down using shRNA. Conversely, Cx43 knockdown resulted in increased \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus in the absence of Wnt activation. Coimmunoprecipitation of Cx43 and \u03b2-catenin proteins with a casein kinase (CKI\u03b4) antibody showed that Cx43 interacts with \u03b2-catenin and may form part of the so-called destruction complex. Functionally, Wnt activation increased the rate of wound reepithelization in rat skin in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cx43", "Nuclear translocation", "Wnt", "Wound healing", "\u03b2-catenin"], "IndexKeywords": ["beta Catenin", "Cell Nucleus", "Cells, Cultured", "Connexin 43", "Gap Junctions", "Humans", "Male", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067225854", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57210216376": {"Name": "Hou X.", "AuthorID": "57210216376", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, The Centre for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, University College London"}, "56904385200": {"Name": "Ahmed A.", "AuthorID": "56904385200", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602690023": {"Name": "Thrasivoulou C.", "AuthorID": "6602690023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, The Centre for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, University College London"}, "7401884327": {"Name": "Becker D.L.", "AuthorID": "7401884327", "AffiliationID": "60078604, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR"}, "57210216216": {"Name": "Khan M.R.A.", "AuthorID": "57210216216", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}, "6701556011": {"Name": "Turmaine M.", "AuthorID": "6701556011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
