As an application, we estimate the size of a logarithmic resonance-free region for scattering by potentials of the form V., where Rd is a finite union of compact subsets of embedded hypersurfaces. In odd dimensions, we prove a resonance expansion for solutions to the wave equation with such a potential.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954305412", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"16401508800": {"Name": "Galkowski J.", "AuthorID": "16401508800", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Department, University of California"}, "57203377406": {"Name": "Smith H.F.", "AuthorID": "57203377406", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Department, University of Washington"}}}
