Researchers are beginning to question the robustness of the evidence base on which negative appraisals are based. The present study aimed to draw on data from a population-representative sample to describe the health, quality of life and impact of caring of informal caregivers of people with an intellectual disability. Informal carers of people with intellectual disability (N = 260) were identified among 2199 carers in the English Survey of Carers in Households 2009/10. Generalised estimating equations explored the association between socio-demographic and caring profile with quality of life, physical health status, and impact on psychological health and personal life. Compared to other caregivers, providing care to a person with intellectual disability was not associated with reduced quality of life. There was an 82% increased risk of reporting poorer health status, even though poorer health was not likely to be attributed to care-giving. A higher risk of negative impact on personal life was seen in comparison with the wider group of caregivers, but not in comparison with more similar-sized caregiver groups (mental health or dementia). Carers of people with intellectual disability were more likely to be struggling financially and have a high caring load. These factors were systematically related to lower well-being. A uniformly negative appraisal of caring for people with intellectual disability was not supported by these English population-representative data. Poverty and long care-giving hours may make caregivers more susceptible to negative well-being. Support for caregivers of people with intellectual disability should focus on alleviating those two factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health", "impact of caregiving", "informal carers", "intellectual disability", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Caregivers", "England", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992530943", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"12760208200": {"Name": "Totsika V.", "AuthorID": "12760208200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research (CEDAR), University of Warwick"}, "7102719472": {"Name": "Hastings R.P.", "AuthorID": "7102719472", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research (CEDAR), University of Warwick"}, "18038918700": {"Name": "Vagenas D.", "AuthorID": "18038918700", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland Institute of Technology"}}}
