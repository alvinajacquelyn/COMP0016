Yet this political commitment has been largely overlooked by scholars. This article offers the first synoptic account of Mill\u2019s writings against corruption. It argues that Mill\u2019s opposition to corruption was not accidental or temperamental, but sprung from fundamental principles of his political thought. It also shows that Mill\u2019s opposition to electoral corruption put him at odds with other leading liberal thinkers of his era, who thought that the existing ways in which wealth influenced elections had positive effects \u2013 or at the very least that they did not impede a healthy electoral contest from taking place. Mill\u2019s fervent intent to eliminate corruption also distinguishes him from many liberal theorists today, who either do not write about electoral corruption, or consider it an issue to be managed and lived-with. Reflecting on Mill\u2019s political thought alongside other liberal thinkers raises the question of whether liberal states can draw a definitive line between prevalent forms of corruption and legitimate modes of political action, and eliminate the former, or whether we must regard corruption as among the constitutive dilemmas of a liberal politics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corruption", "democracy", "elections", "John Stuart Mill", "liberalism", "representative government"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068228951", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"56021710200": {"Name": "Selinger W.", "AuthorID": "56021710200", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard University Committee on Degrees in Social Studies"}}}
