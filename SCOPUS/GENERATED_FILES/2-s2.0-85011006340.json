Complex treatment planning is required to ensure that enough radiation is given to the tumour, and little to other sensitive structures (known as organs at risk) such as the eyes and nerves which might otherwise be damaged. This is especially difficult in the head and neck, where multiple at-risk structures often lie in extremely close proximity to the tumour. It can take radiotherapy experts four hours or more to pick out the important areas on planning scans (known as segmentation). This research will focus on applying machine learning algorithms to automatic segmentation of head and neck planning computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust patients. Through analysis of the images used in radiotherapy DeepMind Health will investigate improvements in efficiency of cancer treatment pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011006340", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"22978962700": {"Name": "Chu C.", "AuthorID": "22978962700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57192163991": {"Name": "De Fauw J.", "AuthorID": "57192163991", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "23092209100": {"Name": "Tomasev N.", "AuthorID": "23092209100", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57192557765": {"Name": "Paredes B.R.", "AuthorID": "57192557765", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56351939700": {"Name": "Hughes C.", "AuthorID": "56351939700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57195333840": {"Name": "Ledsam J.", "AuthorID": "57195333840", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57193128349": {"Name": "Back T.", "AuthorID": "57193128349", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "6505888134": {"Name": "Ronneberger O.", "AuthorID": "6505888134", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "14031214500": {"Name": "Cornebise J.", "AuthorID": "14031214500", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alexandra House, University College London, Bloomsbury Campus"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "36991775200": {"Name": "Sullivan K.", "AuthorID": "36991775200", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "37063598300": {"Name": "Moinuddin S.", "AuthorID": "37063598300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "7006409607": {"Name": "D'Souza D.", "AuthorID": "7006409607", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "7102615127": {"Name": "Mendes R.", "AuthorID": "7102615127", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}}}
