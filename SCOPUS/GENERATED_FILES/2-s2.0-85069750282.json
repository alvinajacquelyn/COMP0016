While land use intensification has resulted in steep declines of wild bee diversity across agricultural landscapes, the creation of semi-natural habitats has been proposed as a counter-measure. However, the relative value of semi-natural and natural habitats in promoting wild bees has rarely been studied, especially for China that harbors the world's largest plantation forest area, characterized by intensively managed, mono-dominant stands of wind-pollinated tree species. We sampled wild bees in apple orchards to assess how their assemblages were influenced by semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape and the local flowering ground-cover. Bee abundance declined with increasing isolation from natural shrubland. In contrast, wild bee diversity and abundance were negatively linked to plantation forests. For the abundance of large bees, this effect was partly ameliorated by local flowering ground-cover. Maintaining or restoring wild bee assemblages in agricultural landscapes therefore requires careful evaluations of restoration measures such as forest planting. Availability of local flower resources and nearby natural shrubland appeared particularly important to enhance wild bees and their potential services in apple orchards.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dispersal ability", "Flowering ground-cover", "Habitat restoration", "Landscape composition", "Pollinator"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069750282", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"57204018143": {"Name": "Wu P.", "AuthorID": "57204018143", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Organic Farming, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University"}, "57200965198": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57200965198", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Organic Farming, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University"}, "57200819843": {"Name": "Song X.", "AuthorID": "57200819843", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Organic Farming, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University"}, "57204310837": {"Name": "Yu Z.", "AuthorID": "57204310837", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Organic Farming, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University"}, "55742019300": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "55742019300", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Organic Farming, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University"}, "15062311900": {"Name": "Axmacher J.C.", "AuthorID": "15062311900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}, "8258050800": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "8258050800", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University"}, "57217798989": {"Name": "Tscharntke T.", "AuthorID": "57217798989", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Agroecology, Department of Crop Sciences, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "7004498228": {"Name": "Westphal C.", "AuthorID": "7004498228", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Functional Agrobiodiversity, Department of Crop Sciences, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}}}
