The artefact is a very rare and highly significant find in East Africa, with only one other example being found previously (also at the same site), and likely represents early contact between coastal East Africa and the Indian Ocean world. Chemical analysis of the residue adhering to this artefact was undertaken to confirm its use to burn incense, and to determine whether the resin used was local or exotic to East Africa and thus likely acquired through long-distance trade. The residue extract was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and identified as Zanzibar copal (. Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.), a local species that rose to major importance in colonial period trade. The results obtained from this study provide the first direct archaeological evidence for the ancient use of this East African species as an aromatic, suggesting that it might have had a much earlier role in long-distance incense trade than previously demonstrated. This finding also provides insights into local East African engagement with the material culture of the Indian Ocean world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["East africa", "GC-MS", "Hymenaea verrucosa", "Incense burner", "Indian ocean trade", "Residue analysis", "Zanzibar copal"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912003179", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"51565679900": {"Name": "Crowther A.", "AuthorID": "51565679900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Science, The University of Queensland"}, "7003292392": {"Name": "Matheson C.D.", "AuthorID": "7003292392", "AffiliationID": "60025949", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Lakehead University"}, "55497195400": {"Name": "Veall M.A.", "AuthorID": "55497195400", "AffiliationID": "60025949", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Lakehead University"}, "16038509400": {"Name": "Boivin N.", "AuthorID": "16038509400", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology, University of Oxford"}, "56103778400": {"Name": "Kotarba-Morley A.", "AuthorID": "56103778400", "AffiliationID": "60189147, 60011664", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Archaeological Science, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Wollongong"}, "7101897861": {"Name": "Horton M.", "AuthorID": "7101897861", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Bristol"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College of London"}, "55189835400": {"Name": "Fenn T.", "AuthorID": "55189835400", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale Center for the Study of Ancient Pyro-Technology, The Council on Archaeological Studies, Department of Anthropology, Yale University"}, "56427970600": {"Name": "Haji O.", "AuthorID": "56427970600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Museums and Antiquities"}}}
