Its performance is not affected by large frequency offsets. This leads to greatly reduced waiting times compared with previous coherent optical packet receivers, which in turn can significantly increase throughput in the coherent optical packet switched networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burst switching", "Differential phase shift keying", "Optical fiber communication", "Phase modulation", "Polarization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Burst-switching", "Differential phase-shift keying", "Doubly differential", "Dual-polarizations", "Energy efficient", "Frequency offsets", "Polarization demultiplexing", "Reconfigurable network"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962339526", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"54396346200": {"Name": "Walsh A.J.", "AuthorID": "54396346200", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "Rince Institute, Dublin City University"}, "7005909566": {"Name": "Barry L.P.", "AuthorID": "7005909566", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "Rince Institute, Dublin City University"}, "55710770700": {"Name": "Mountjoy J.", "AuthorID": "55710770700", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Electronic and Communications Engineering"}, "7006947452": {"Name": "Fagan A.", "AuthorID": "7006947452", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Electronic and Communications Engineering"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7201547136": {"Name": "Ellis A.D.", "AuthorID": "7201547136", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science"}}}
