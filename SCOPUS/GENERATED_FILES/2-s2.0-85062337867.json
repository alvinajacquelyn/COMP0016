KGaA, WeinheimLiquid\u2013fluid interfaces provide a platform both for structuring liquids into complex shapes and assembling dimensionally confined, functional nanomaterials. Historically, attention in this area has focused on simple emulsions and foams, in which surface-active materials such as surfactants or colloids stabilize structures against coalescence and alter the mechanical properties of the interface. In recent decades, however, a growing body of work has begun to demonstrate the full potential of the assembly of nanomaterials at liquid\u2013fluid interfaces to generate functionally advanced, biomimetic systems. Here, a broad overview is given, from fundamentals to applications, of the use of liquid\u2013fluid interfaces to generate complex, all-liquid devices with a myriad of potential applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colloids", "complex fluids", "interfacial assembly", "nanomaterials", "structured liquids"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomimetic systems", "Complex fluids", "Fluid interface", "Functional Nano materials", "Interfacial assembly", "Reconfigurable devices", "Structured liquids", "Surface active materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062337867", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56153052900": {"Name": "Forth J.", "AuthorID": "56153052900", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "55933578200": {"Name": "Kim P.Y.", "AuthorID": "55933578200", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "57217700045": {"Name": "Xie G.", "AuthorID": "57217700045", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Science and Engineering Department, University of Massachusetts"}, "57195217803": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57195217803", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57204368153": {"Name": "Helms B.A.", "AuthorID": "57204368153", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "The Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "57203198687": {"Name": "Russell T.P.", "AuthorID": "57203198687", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "WPI\u2014Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR), Tohoku University"}}}
