OAM is a new degree of freedom in EM waves and is promising for channel multiplexing in the communication system. Although the OAM-carrying EM wave attracts more and more attention, the method of OAM generation at microwave frequencies still faces challenges, such as efficiency and simulation time. In this communication, by using the circuit theory and equivalence principle, we build two simplified models, one for a single scatter and one for the whole metasurface to predict their EM responses. Both of the models significantly simplify the design procedure and reduce the simulation time. In this communication, we propose an ultrathin complementary metasurface that converts a left-handed (right-handed) circularly polarized plane wave without OAM to a right-handed (left-handed) circularly polarized wave with OAM of arbitrary orders, and a high transmission efficiency can be achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Babinet's principle", "circuit theory", "equivalence principle", "orbital angular momentum (OAM)", "ultrathin complementary metasurface"], "IndexKeywords": ["Babinet's principle", "Channel multiplexing", "Circularly polarized", "Circularly polarized waves", "Equivalence principles", "Helical wave fronts", "Metasurface", "Orbital angular momentum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009144993", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57116687500": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57116687500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
