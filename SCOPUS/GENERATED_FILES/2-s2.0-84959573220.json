Objective To report medium-term outcomes in men receiving primary whole-gland HIFU from a national multi-centre registry cohort. Design, setting, and participants Five-hundred and sixty-nine patients at eight hospitals were entered into an academic registry. Intervention Whole-gland HIFU (Sonablate 500) for primary nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Redo-HIFU was permitted as part of the intervention. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Our primary failure-free survival outcome incorporated no transition to any of the following: (1) local salvage therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), (2) systemic therapy, (3) metastases, or (4) prostate cancer-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and genitourinary function. Results and limitations Mean age was 65 yr (47\u201387 yr). Median prostate-specific antigen was 7.0 ng/ml (interquartile range 4.4\u201310.2). National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease was 161 (28%), 321 (56%), and 81 (14%), respectively. One hundred and sixty three of 569 (29%) required a total of 185 redo-HIFU procedures. Median follow-up was 46 (interquartile range 23\u201361) mo. Failure-free survival at 5 yr after first HIFU was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64\u201374). This was 87% (95% CI: 78\u201393), 63% (95% CI: 56\u201370), and 58% (95% CI: 32\u201377) for National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Fifty eight of 754 (7.7%) had one urinary tract infection, 22/574 (2.9%) a recurrent urinary tract infection, 22/754 (3%) epididymo-orchitis, 227/754 (30%) endoscopic interventions, 1/754 (0.13%) recto-urethral fistula, and 1/754 (0.13%) osteitis pubis. Of 206 known to be pad-free pre-HIFU, 183/206 (88%) remained pad free, and of 236 with good baseline erectile function, 91/236 (39%) maintained good function. The main limitation is lack of long-term data. Conclusions Whole-gland HIFU is a repeatable day-case treatment that confers low rates of urinary incontinence. Disease control at a median of just under 5 yr of follow-up demonstrates its potential as a treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Endoscopic interventions and erectile dysfunction rates are similar to other whole-gland treatments. Patient summary In this report we looked at the 5-yr outcomes following whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment for prostate cancer and found that cancer control was acceptable with a low risk of urine leakage. However, risk of erectile dysfunction and further operations was similar to other whole-gland treatments like surgery and radiotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High-intensity focused ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biopsy", "Disease-Free Survival", "Follow-Up Studies", "High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostate", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Registries", "Retreatment", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959573220", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"36460725700": {"Name": "Dickinson L.", "AuthorID": "36460725700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60026336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "54382137700": {"Name": "McCartan N.", "AuthorID": "54382137700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "9739106900": {"Name": "Cathcart P.", "AuthorID": "9739106900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "56545193700": {"Name": "Nathan S.", "AuthorID": "56545193700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "56527939200": {"Name": "Weir S.", "AuthorID": "56527939200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7006158288": {"Name": "Afzal N.", "AuthorID": "7006158288", "AffiliationID": "60013485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "6603340376": {"Name": "Cornaby A.", "AuthorID": "6603340376", "AffiliationID": "60013485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7004357370": {"Name": "Charman S.C.", "AuthorID": "7004357370", "AffiliationID": "60008659", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Unit"}, "7102799145": {"Name": "van der Meulen J.", "AuthorID": "7102799145", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy"}, "6603779879": {"Name": "Hindley R.G.", "AuthorID": "6603779879", "AffiliationID": "60170281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7004649709": {"Name": "Lewi H.", "AuthorID": "7004649709", "AffiliationID": "60004202", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7005808886": {"Name": "Ogden C.", "AuthorID": "7005808886", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Urology"}, "35467356700": {"Name": "Persad R.", "AuthorID": "35467356700", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}}}
