A novel concept of solar receiver for combined heat and power (CHP) generation consisting of a compartmented dense gas fluidized bed has been proposed to effectively accomplish three complementary tasks: collection of incident solar radiation, heat transfer to the working fluid of the thermodynamic cycle and thermal energy storage. A dynamical model of the system laid the basis for optimizing collection of incident radiative power, heat transfer to the steam cycle, storage of energy as sensible heat of bed solids providing the ground for the basic design of a 700kWth demonstration CSP plant.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023626637", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603202600": {"Name": "Solimene R.", "AuthorID": "6603202600", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto di Ricerche sulla Combustione, Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche"}, "57188744930": {"Name": "Chirone R.", "AuthorID": "57188744930", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto di Ricerche sulla Combustione, Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche"}, "56971018600": {"Name": "Chirone R.", "AuthorID": "56971018600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}, "57204840732": {"Name": "Salatino P.", "AuthorID": "57204840732", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}}}
