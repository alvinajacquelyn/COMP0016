We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies evaluating the influence of voluntary weight loss on cognitive function in obese/overweight individuals. Articles were acquired from a systematic search of major databases from inception till 01/2016. A random effect meta-analysis of weight loss interventions (diet, physical activity, bariatric surgery) on different cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive functions, language and motor speed) was conducted. Twenty studies (13 longitudinal studies = 551 participants; 7 RCTs = 328 treated vs. 140 controls) were included. Weight loss was associated with a significant improvement in attention and memory in both longitudinal studies and RCTs, whereas executive function and language improved in longitudinal and RCT studies, respectively. In conclusion, intentional weight loss in obese/overweight people is associated with improvements in performance across various cognitive domains. Future adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm/refute these findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Cognition", "Memory", "Meta-analysis", "Nutrition", "Obesity", "Physical activity", "Weight loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Exercise", "Humans", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999277949", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "116531760", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Research and Education in Medicine (IREM)"}, "55322381300": {"Name": "Facchini S.", "AuthorID": "55322381300", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, DIMED, University of Padova"}, "24547168700": {"Name": "Manzato E.", "AuthorID": "24547168700", "AffiliationID": "100614454", "AffiliationName": "Aging Section, Institute of Neurosciences, Italian Research Council"}, "7004676852": {"Name": "Sergi G.", "AuthorID": "7004676852", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, DIMED, University of Padova"}, "6507233742": {"Name": "Solmi M.", "AuthorID": "6507233742", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60170475, 60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "55932815600": {"Name": "Luchini C.", "AuthorID": "55932815600", "AffiliationID": "60060733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, Verona University and Hospital Trust"}, "57203083453": {"Name": "Maggi S.", "AuthorID": "57203083453", "AffiliationID": "100614454", "AffiliationName": "Aging Section, Institute of Neurosciences, Italian Research Council"}, "55948960700": {"Name": "Cosco T.", "AuthorID": "55948960700", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing"}, "57197469273": {"Name": "Fontana L.", "AuthorID": "57197469273", "AffiliationID": "60159407", "AffiliationName": "CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate"}}}
