Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that regulates a variety of cellular functions. Here, we demonstrate that endothelial PKA activity is essential for vascular development, specifically regulating the transition from sprouting to stabilization of nascent vessels. Inhibition of endothelial PKA by endothelial cell-specific expression of dominant-negative PKA in mice led to perturbed vascular development, hemorrhage and embryonic lethality at mid-gestation. During perinatal retinal angiogenesis, inhibition of PKA resulted in hypersprouting as a result of increased numbers of tip cells. In zebrafish, cell autonomous PKA inhibition also increased and sustained endothelial cell motility, driving cells to become tip cells. Although these effects of PKA inhibition were highly reminiscent of Notch inhibition effects, our data demonstrate that PKA and Notch independently regulate tip and stalk cell formation and behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Notch", "Retina", "Signal transduction", "Sprouting", "Vascular development"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Movement", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Endothelial Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Receptors, Notch", "Retina", "Signal Transduction", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991325322", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"6602734227": {"Name": "Nedvetsky P.I.", "AuthorID": "6602734227", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Patterning Laboratory, Vesalius Research Center, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven"}, "57191529270": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "57191529270", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Patterning Laboratory, Vesalius Research Center, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven"}, "6507581379": {"Name": "Mathivet T.", "AuthorID": "6507581379", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Patterning Laboratory, Vesalius Research Center, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven"}, "6506601314": {"Name": "Stanchi F.", "AuthorID": "6506601314", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Patterning Laboratory, Vesalius Research Center, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven"}, "8265989400": {"Name": "Gerhardt H.", "AuthorID": "8265989400", "AffiliationID": "60126120", "AffiliationName": "Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"}, "36491288700": {"Name": "Aspalter I.M.", "AuthorID": "36491288700", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Biology Laboratory, London Research Institute \u2013 Cancer Research UK, Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields Laboratories"}, "7102961726": {"Name": "Metzger R.J.", "AuthorID": "7102961726", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco"}, "7006012105": {"Name": "Mostov K.E.", "AuthorID": "7006012105", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco"}}}
