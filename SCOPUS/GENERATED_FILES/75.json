Method: Using conversation analytic methods, a video collection of five naturally occurring problematic topic transitions was identified, transcribed and analysed. These were extracted from a main collection of over 200 other-initiated repair sequences and a sub-set of 15 problematic topic transition sequences. The sequences were analysed with reference to how the participants both identified and resolved the problems. Result: Analysis revealed that topic transition by people with dysarthria can prove problematic. Conversation partners may find transitions problematic not only because of speech intelligibility but also because of a sequential disjuncture between the dysarthric speech turn and whatever topic has come prior. In addition the treatment of problematic topic transition as a complaint reveals the potential vulnerability of people with dysarthria to judgements of competence. Conclusion: These findings have implications for how dysarthria is conceptualized and how specific actions in conversation, such as topic transition, might be suitable targets for clinical intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conversation analysis", "Dysarthria", "neurodegenerative diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Dysarthria", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Neuron Disease", "Speech Intelligibility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942765037", "SubjectAreas": [["Research and Theory", "NURS", "2922"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["LPN and LVN", "NURS", "2912"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"15030938100": {"Name": "Bloch S.", "AuthorID": "15030938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language and Communication, University College London, 2 Chandler House"}, "18134452300": {"Name": "Saldert C.", "AuthorID": "18134452300", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Division of Speech and Language Pathology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "8238429400": {"Name": "Ferm U.", "AuthorID": "8238429400", "AffiliationID": "60008841, 60031699", "AffiliationName": "DART-Centre for AAC and at, Regional Rehabilitation Centre, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
