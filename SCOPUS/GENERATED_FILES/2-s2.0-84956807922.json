The objective of this study was to develop a composite response index in dcSSc (CRISS) for use in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We developed 150 paper patient profiles with standardized clinical outcome elements (core set items) using patients with dcSSc. Forty scleroderma experts rated 20 patient profiles each and assessed whether each patient had improved or not improved over a period of 1 year. Using the profiles for which raters had reached a consensus on whether the patients were improved versus not improved (79% of the profiles examined), we fit logistic regression models in which the binary outcome referred to whether the patient was improved or not, and the changes in the core set items from baseline to followup were entered as covariates. We tested the final index in a previously completed RCT. Results Sixteen of 31 core items were included in the patient profiles after a consensus meeting and review of test characteristics of patient-level data. In the logistic regression model in which the included core set items were change over 1 year in the modified Rodnan skin thickness score, the forced vital capacity, the patient and physician global assessments, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, sensitivity was 0.982 (95% confidence interval 0.982-0.983) and specificity was 0.931 (95% confidence interval 0.930-0.932), and the model with these 5 items had the highest face validity. Subjects with a significant worsening of renal or cardiopulmonary involvement were classified as not improved, regardless of improvements in other core items. With use of the index, the effect of methotrexate could be differentiated from the effect of placebo in a 1-year RCT (P = 0.02). Conclusion We have developed a CRISS that is appropriate for use as an outcome assessment in RCTs of early dcSSc.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Reproducibility of Results", "Rheumatology", "Scleroderma, Diffuse", "Societies, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956807922", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"24066781200": {"Name": "Khanna D.", "AuthorID": "24066781200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "6505532807": {"Name": "Berrocal V.J.", "AuthorID": "6505532807", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "35113994200": {"Name": "Schiopu E.", "AuthorID": "35113994200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "7201518031": {"Name": "Phillips K.", "AuthorID": "7201518031", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "7101771475": {"Name": "Giannini E.H.", "AuthorID": "7101771475", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Cincinnati Children's Hospital"}, "7006621337": {"Name": "Seibold J.R.", "AuthorID": "7006621337", "AffiliationID": "112590420", "AffiliationName": "Scleroderma Research Consultants"}, "7005329470": {"Name": "Merkel P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005329470", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania"}, "7005129971": {"Name": "Mayes M.D.", "AuthorID": "7005129971", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60032211", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston"}, "8907543700": {"Name": "Assassi S.", "AuthorID": "8907543700", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60032211", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston"}, "25952078200": {"Name": "Baron M.", "AuthorID": "25952078200", "AffiliationID": "60018916, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Jewish General Hospital, McGill University"}, "7103297401": {"Name": "Clements P.J.", "AuthorID": "7103297401", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "7403972488": {"Name": "Wong W.K.", "AuthorID": "7403972488", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "7102326195": {"Name": "Furst D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102326195", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "7005011211": {"Name": "Steen V.", "AuthorID": "7005011211", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60019163, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University, Cochin Hospital, AP-HP"}, "7003519327": {"Name": "Allanore Y.", "AuthorID": "7003519327", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60019163, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University, Cochin Hospital, AP-HP"}, "7006880659": {"Name": "Simms R.W.", "AuthorID": "7006880659", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University, College London Medical School"}, "7003679934": {"Name": "Distler O.", "AuthorID": "7003679934", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Zurich"}, "35614096500": {"Name": "Johnson S.R.", "AuthorID": "35614096500", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60002401", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "7005642558": {"Name": "Matucci-Cerinic M.", "AuthorID": "7005642558", "AffiliationID": "60021921, 60021859", "AffiliationName": "Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi (AOUC), University of Florence"}, "57203074234": {"Name": "Pope J.E.", "AuthorID": "57203074234", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60008242, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Schulich School of Medicine, Western University, London Campus, and St. Joseph's Health Care"}, "6602841697": {"Name": "Proudman S.M.", "AuthorID": "6602841697", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60031564", "AffiliationName": "Royal Adelaide Hospital, University of Adelaide"}, "7403199141": {"Name": "Siegel J.", "AuthorID": "7403199141", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech/Roche"}, "7202097828": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "7202097828", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital"}}}
