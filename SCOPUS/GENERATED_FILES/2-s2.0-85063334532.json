The study and the dissection of FTLD is complex due to its clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity. In this review, we survey the state-of-the-art genetics of familial FTLD and recapitulate our current understanding of the genetic architecture of sporadic FTLD by summarizing results of genome-wide association studies performed in FTLD to date. We then discuss the challenges of translating these heterogeneous genetic features into the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of FTLD pathogenesis. We particularly highlight a number of susceptibility processes that appear to be conserved across familial and sporadic cases (e.g., and the cellular waste disposal pathways, and immune system signaling) and finally describe cutting-edge approaches, based on mathematical prediction tools, highlighting novel intriguing risk pathways such as DNA damage response as an emerging theme in FTLD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disease mechanism", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration", "FTD\u2013GWAS", "Genetics", "Mendelian FTD", "Pathways", "Sporadic FTD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "DNA Damage", "Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport", "Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Progranulins", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063334532", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57207946473": {"Name": "Raffaele F.", "AuthorID": "57207946473", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "57207949447": {"Name": "Claudia M.", "AuthorID": "57207949447", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Reading"}, "57207944814": {"Name": "John H.", "AuthorID": "57207944814", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}}}
