The doped films showed a remarkable morphology and enhanced photoactivity when compared to their undoped analogues. The TiO2:B films also presented enhanced conductivity and electron mobility as measured by a Hall effect probe as well as a high adherence to the substrate, stability and extended lifetime. The structure and composition of the different samples of TiO2:B films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (D-SIMS). Hybrid density functional theory was used to explore the defect chemistry of B-doped anatase and to understand the experimental results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition", "Defect chemistry", "Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry", "Enhanced conductivity", "Extended lifetime", "Float glass substrates", "Hybrid density functional theory", "Interstitial boron"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040512567", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57191366242": {"Name": "Quesada-Gonzalez M.", "AuthorID": "57191366242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building, University College London"}, "56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.A.D.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "56119704200": {"Name": "Sotelo-Vazquez C.", "AuthorID": "56119704200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building, University College London"}, "16744209400": {"Name": "Quesada-Cabrera R.", "AuthorID": "16744209400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building, University College London"}, "12139371400": {"Name": "Boscher N.D.", "AuthorID": "12139371400", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Research and Technology, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "26039181400": {"Name": "Kafizas A.", "AuthorID": "26039181400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}}}
