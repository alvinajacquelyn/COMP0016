However, growing concerns over gemcitabine resistance mean that new combinatory therapies are required to prevent loss of efficacy with prolonged treatment. Here, we suggest that this could be achieved through co-administration of RNA interference agents targeting the ubiquitin ligase ITCH. Stable anti-ITCH siRNA and shRNA dendriplexes with a desirable safety profile were prepared using generation 3 poly(propylenimine) dendrimers (DAB-Am16). The complexes were efficiently taken up by human pancreatic cancer cells and produced a 40-60% decrease in ITCH RNA and protein expression in vitro (si/shRNA) and in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer (shRNA). When co-administered with gemcitabine (100. mg/kg/week) at a subtherapeutic dose, treatment with ITCH-shRNA (3x 50. mg/week) was able to fully suppress tumour growth for 17. days, suggesting that downregulation of ITCH mediated by DAB-Am16/shRNA sensitizes pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine in an efficient and specific manner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dendrimer", "Dendriplex", "ITCH", "P73", "Pancreatic Cancer", "Polypropylenimine", "ShRNA", "SiRNA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dendriplexes", "ITCH", "Pancreatic cancers", "Polypropylenimine", "ShRNA", "SiRNA", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Deoxycytidine", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Polypropylenes", "Repressor Proteins", "RNA Interference", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922768824", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"35600693200": {"Name": "de la Fuente M.", "AuthorID": "35600693200", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Nano-oncologicals lab, Translational Medical Oncology group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Clinical University Hospital of Santiago de Compostela (CHUS)"}, "55491027300": {"Name": "Jones M.C.", "AuthorID": "55491027300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy and Therapeutics section, School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "14519630700": {"Name": "Santander-Ortega M.J.", "AuthorID": "14519630700", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Castilla-La Mancha"}, "56369232600": {"Name": "Mirenska A.", "AuthorID": "56369232600", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Pneumology, Allergology and Neonatology, Hannover Medical School"}, "55007038100": {"Name": "Marimuthu P.", "AuthorID": "55007038100", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7004524463": {"Name": "Uchegbu I.", "AuthorID": "7004524463", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "6604050498": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4tzlein A.", "AuthorID": "6604050498", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
