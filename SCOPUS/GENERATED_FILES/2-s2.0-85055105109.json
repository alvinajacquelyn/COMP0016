Using in-line phase contrast synchrotron X-ray tomography, we capture the rapid evolution of the ice cream microstructure during heat shock conditions in situ and operando, on a time scale of minutes. The further evolution of the ice cream microstructure during storage and abuse was captured using ex situ tomography on a time scale of days. The morphology of the ice crystals and unfrozen matrix during these thermal cycles was quantified as an indicator for the texture and oral sensory perception. Our results reveal that the coarsening is due to both Ostwald ripening and physical agglomeration, enhancing our understanding of the microstructural evolution of ice cream during both manufacturing and storage. The microstructural evolution of this complex material was quantified, providing new insights into the behavior of soft-solids and semi-solids, including many foodstuffs, and invaluable data to both inform and validate models of their processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coarsening", "Ice cream", "Ice crystals", "Microstructure", "Soft solids", "Tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex materials", "Ice creams", "Ice crystals", "In-line phase contrast", "Sensory experiences", "Soft-solid", "Synchrotron X-ray tomography", "Three-dimensional microstructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055105109", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57202777094": {"Name": "Mo J.", "AuthorID": "57202777094", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "57204285607": {"Name": "Graham McCartney D.", "AuthorID": "57204285607", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "57203258355": {"Name": "Rockett P.", "AuthorID": "57203258355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "16309781600": {"Name": "Eastwood D.S.", "AuthorID": "16309781600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "The Manchester X-ray Imaging Facility, School of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "54915253600": {"Name": "Guo E.", "AuthorID": "54915253600", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}, "7004950219": {"Name": "Bent J.", "AuthorID": "7004950219", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever R and D"}, "6603020581": {"Name": "Van Dalen G.", "AuthorID": "6603020581", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever R and D"}, "6602192495": {"Name": "Schuetz P.", "AuthorID": "6602192495", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever R and D"}}}
