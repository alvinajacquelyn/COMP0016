An important question, however, is that of directly linking the signals coming from Twitter with other sources of evidence about average mood changes. Specifically we compare Twitter signals relative to anxiety, sadness, anger, and fatigue with purchase of items related to anxiety, stress and fatigue at a major UK Health and Beauty retailer. Results show that all of these signals are highly correlated and strongly seasonal, being under-expressed in the summer and over-expressed in the other seasons, with interesting differences and similarities across them. Anxiety signals, extracted from both Twitter and from Health product purchases, peak in spring and autumn, and correlate also with the purchase of stress remedies, while Twitter sadness has a peak in the Winter, along with Twitter anger and remedies for fatigue. Surprisingly, purchase of remedies for fatigue do not match the Twitter fatigue, suggesting that perhaps the names we give to these indicators are only approximate indications of what they actually measure. This study contributes both to the clarification of the mood signals contained in social media, and more generally to our understanding of seasonal cycles in collective mood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational neuroscience", "Emotions", "Human behaviour", "Periodic patterns", "Social media mining"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational neuroscience", "Emotions", "Human behaviours", "Periodic pattern", "Social media minings"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032711530", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36631655800": {"Name": "Dzogang F.", "AuthorID": "36631655800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Systems Laboratory, University of Bristol"}, "55892899100": {"Name": "Cristianini N.", "AuthorID": "55892899100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Systems Laboratory, University of Bristol"}, "6701633840": {"Name": "Goulding J.", "AuthorID": "6701633840", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "N-LAB, University of Nottingham"}, "36067479700": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "36067479700", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
