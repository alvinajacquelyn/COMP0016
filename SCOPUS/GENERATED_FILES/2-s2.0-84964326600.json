In this article we provide a carefully formulated asymptotic theory for a class of such adaptive SMC methods. The theoretical framework developed here will cover, under assumptions, several commonly used SMC algorithms [Chopin, Biometrika 89 (2002) 539-551; Jasra et al., Scand. J. Stat. 38 (2011) 1-22; Sch\u00e4fer and Chopin, Stat. Comput. 23 (2013) 163- 184]. There are only limited results about the theoretical underpinning of such adaptive methods: We will bridge this gap by providing a weak law of large numbers (WLLN) and a central limit theorem (CLT) for some of these algorithms. The latter seems to be the first result of its kind in the literature and provides a formal justification of algorithms used in many real data contexts [Jasra et al. (2011); Sch\u00e4fer and Chopin (2013)]. We establish that for a general class of adaptive SMC algorithms [Chopin (2002)], the asymptotic variance of the estimators from the adaptive SMC method is identical to a \"limiting\" SMC algorithm which uses ideal proposal kernels. Our results are supported by application on a complex high-dimensional posterior distribution associated with the Navier-Stokes model, where adapting highdimensional parameters of the proposal kernels is critical for the efficiency of the algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive sequential monte carlo", "CLT", "MCMC"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964326600", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"11539098100": {"Name": "Beskos A.", "AuthorID": "11539098100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "14035658500": {"Name": "Jasra A.", "AuthorID": "14035658500", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, National University of Singapore"}, "55780359100": {"Name": "Thiery A.", "AuthorID": "55780359100", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, National University of Singapore"}, "24477373900": {"Name": "Kantas N.", "AuthorID": "24477373900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}}}
