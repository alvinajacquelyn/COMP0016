The role of the physical environment in this biological revolution, such as changes to oxygen levels and nutrient availability, has been the focus of longstanding debate. Seemingly contradictory data from geochemical redox proxies help to fuel this controversy. As an essential nutrient, nitrogen can help to resolve this impasse by establishing linkages between nutrient supply, ocean redox, and biological changes. Here we present a comprehensive N-isotope dataset from the Yangtze Basin that reveals remarkable coupling between \u03b415N, \u03b413C, and evolutionary events from circa 551 to 515 Ma. The results indicate that increased fixed nitrogen supply may have facilitated episodic animal radiations by reinforcing ocean oxygenation, and restricting anoxia to near, or even at the sediment-water interface. Conversely, sporadic ocean anoxic events interrupted ocean oxygenation, and may have led to extinctions of the Ediacaran biota and small shelly animals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049539036", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57198729089": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57198729089", "AffiliationID": "60012060, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Lab. of Palaeobiology and Stratigr. and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7406185291": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "7406185291", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "MNR Key Laboratory of Isotope Geology, MNR Key Laboratory of Deep-Earth Dynamics, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "7202062675": {"Name": "Ling H.", "AuthorID": "7202062675", "AffiliationID": "60012060, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Lab. of Palaeobiology and Stratigr. and Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55641233200": {"Name": "Struck U.", "AuthorID": "55641233200", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "56688456600": {"Name": "Gamper A.", "AuthorID": "56688456600", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "18042674000": {"Name": "Zhu M.", "AuthorID": "18042674000", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57190178443": {"Name": "He T.", "AuthorID": "57190178443", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "55798835500": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "55798835500", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "MNR Key Laboratory of Stratigraphy and Palaeontology, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "14626549300": {"Name": "Shields G.", "AuthorID": "14626549300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
