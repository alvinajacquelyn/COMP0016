Few have explored the extent of utilization of communication technology in exploring risk perception by patients enrolled in substance abuse services.The Overdose RIsk InfOrmatioN (ORION) project is a European Commission funded programme, aimed to develop and pilot an e-health psycho-educational tool to provide information to drug using individuals about the risks of suffering a drug overdose. Methods: In this article, we report on phase 1 (risk estimation), phase 2 (design), and phase 3 (feasibility) of the ORION project. Results: The development of ORION e-health tool underlined the importance of an evidence-based intervention aimed in obtaining reliable evaluation of risk. The ORION tool supported a decision making process aimed at influencing the substance users' self-efficacy and the degree to which the substance users' understand risk factors. Therefore, its innovative power consisted in translating risks combination into a clear estimation for the user who will then appear more likely to be interested in his/her risk perception. Conclusion: Exploratory field testing and validation confirmed the next stage of evaluation, namely, collection of routine patient samples in study clinics. The associations between risk perception of overdose, engagement with the ORION tool and willingness to alter overdose risk factors, in a clinical setting across various EU member states will further confirm the ORION tool's generalisability and effectiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision making", "Opioids", "Risk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical settings", "Communication technologies", "Decision making process", "Decision supports", "Educational tools", "European Commission", "Opioids", "Risk information", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Decision Support Techniques", "Drug Overdose", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Assessment", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985037115", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"6603786612": {"Name": "Baldacchino A.", "AuthorID": "6603786612", "AffiliationID": "60009979, 60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Medical and Biological Sciences Building North Haugh, University of St Andrews"}, "35576919100": {"Name": "Humphris G.", "AuthorID": "35576919100", "AffiliationID": "60009979, 60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Medical and Biological Sciences Building North Haugh, University of St Andrews"}, "57213664026": {"Name": "Neufeind J.", "AuthorID": "57213664026", "AffiliationID": "60117122", "AffiliationName": "Playfield Institute, Startheden Hospital"}, "55634683100": {"Name": "Crocamo C.", "AuthorID": "55634683100", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia, Unit of Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology"}, "57203670055": {"Name": "Frisher M.", "AuthorID": "57203670055", "AffiliationID": "116794420", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, School of Pharmacy"}, "7004109625": {"Name": "Scherbaum N.", "AuthorID": "7004109625", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Addictive Behaviour and Addiction Medicine, LVR-Hospital Essen, Hospital of the University of Duisburg-Essen"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carra G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, San Gerardo University Hospital"}}}
