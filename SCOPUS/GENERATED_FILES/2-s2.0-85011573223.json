All rights reserved.Inverse problems in cardiovascular modelling have become increasingly important to assess each patient individually. These problems entail estimation of patient-specific model parameters from uncertain measurements acquired in the clinic. In recent years, the method of data assimilation, especially the unscented Kalman filter, has gained popularity to address computational efficiency and uncertainty consideration in such problems. This work highlights and presents solutions to several challenges of this method pertinent to models of cardiovascular haemodynamics. These include methods to (i) avoid ill-conditioning of the covariance matrix, (ii) handle a variety of measurement types, (iii) include a variety of prior knowledge in the method, and (iv) incorporate measurements acquired at different heart rates, a common situation in the clinic where the patient state differs according to the clinical situation. Results are presented for two patient-specific cases of congenital heart disease. To illustrate and validate data assimilation with measurements at different heart rates, the results are presented on a synthetic dataset and on a patient-specific case with heart valve regurgitation. It is shown that the new method significantly improves the agreement between model predictions and measurements. The developed methods can be readily applied to other pathophysiologies and extended to dynamical systems which exhibit different responses under different sets of known parameters or different sets of inputs (such as forcing/excitation frequencies).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data assimilation", "Haemodynamics", "Heart rate", "Parameter estimation", "Singleventricle physiology", "Unscented Kalman filter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular modelling", "Congenital heart disease", "Data assimilation", "Haemodynamics", "Heart rate variability", "Heart rates", "Uncertain measurements", "Unscented Kalman Filter", "Heart Rate", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Models, Cardiovascular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011573223", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56121134700": {"Name": "Pant S.", "AuthorID": "56121134700", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60072945", "AffiliationName": "Inria Paris and Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s UPMC Paris 6, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions"}, "13004394100": {"Name": "Vignon-Clementel I.E.", "AuthorID": "13004394100", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60072945", "AffiliationName": "Inria Paris and Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s UPMC Paris 6, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions"}, "54882677100": {"Name": "Corsini C.", "AuthorID": "54882677100", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering 'Giulio Natta', Politecnico di Milano"}, "7004162794": {"Name": "Pennati G.", "AuthorID": "7004162794", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering 'Giulio Natta', Politecnico di Milano"}, "57198875486": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "57198875486", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Unit, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "54883432300": {"Name": "Hsia T.Y.", "AuthorID": "54883432300", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Unit, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
