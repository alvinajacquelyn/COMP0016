Overall, 58% of 12- and 45% of 15-year-olds reported at least one oral impact in the past three months. The most prevalent oral impact was feeling embarrassed to smile or laugh, followed by difficulty eating. These symptoms and oral impacts were disproportionately high among children eligible for free school meals. Furthermore, one fifth to one third of parents reported that their children's oral conditions had some impact on their family life.Conclusion Oral symptoms were common and oral conditions had a negative impact on the quality of life of large proportions of children. There were clear and marked socioeconomic inequalities, with considerably worse oral health perceptions and higher levels of oral impacts among the more deprived children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dental Caries", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Northern Ireland", "Oral Health", "Quality of Life", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984614688", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"37004773100": {"Name": "Ravaghi V.", "AuthorID": "37004773100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham"}, "24759167000": {"Name": "Holmes R.D.", "AuthorID": "24759167000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Health Research, School of Dental Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "7402403867": {"Name": "Steele J.G.", "AuthorID": "7402403867", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Health Research, School of Dental Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
