{"Title": "Four-year stability of anthropometric and cardio-metabolic parameters in a prospective cohort of older adults", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Biomarkers Med.", "Volume": "9", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 109, "PageEnd": 122, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.2217/BMM.14.78", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84923492193&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Future Medicine Ltd.Aim: To examine the medium-term stability of anthropometric and cardio-metabolic parameters in the general population. Materials & methods: Participants were 5160 men and women from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (age \u226550 years) assessed in 2004 and 2008. Anthropometric data included height, weight, BMI and waist circumference. Cardio-metabolic parameters included blood pressure, serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides), hemoglobin, fasting glucose, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein. Results: Stability of anthropometric variables was high (all intraclass correlations >0.92), although mean values changed slightly (-0.01 kg weight, +1.33 cm waist). Cardio-metabolic parameters showed more variation: correlations ranged from 0.43 (glucose) to 0.81 (HDL). The majority of participants (71-97%) remained in the same grouping relative to established clinical cut-offs. Conclusion: Over a 4-year period, anthropometric and cardio-metabolic parameters showed good stability. These findings suggest that when no means to obtain more recent data exist, a one-time sample will give a reasonable approximation to average levels over the medium-term, although reliability is reduced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropometric", "Cardio-metabolic", "Reliability", "Reproducibility", "Stability", "Variability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Analysis of Variance", "Anthropometry", "Biomarkers", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Pressure", "Body Height", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cholesterol", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Female", "Humans", "Lipids", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Triglycerides", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923492193", "SubjectAreas": [["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603929009": {"Name": "Van Jaarsveld C.H.M.", "AuthorID": "6603929009", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.J.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8245299200": {"Name": "Gunter M.J.", "AuthorID": "8245299200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychobiology Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
