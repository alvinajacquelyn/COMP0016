The methods employed to correct for the impact of pile-up on jet energy, shapes and multiplicity with the ATLAS detector are presented here. They include energy correction techniques based on estimates of the average pile-up energy density and jet-to-vertex association techniques. Extensions of these methods to reduce the impact of pile-up on jet shapes use both subtraction and grooming procedures. Prospects for pile-up suppression at the HL-LHC are also shown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATLAS", "HL-LHC", "Jets", "LHC", "Pile-up"], "IndexKeywords": ["ATLAS", "ATLAS detectors", "Energy correction", "HL-LHC", "Large Hadron Collider", "Mitigation techniques", "Pile-ups", "Proton interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977892671", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"35313615100": {"Name": "Testa M.", "AuthorID": "35313615100", "AffiliationID": "60016340", "AffiliationName": "LNF, INFN"}}}
