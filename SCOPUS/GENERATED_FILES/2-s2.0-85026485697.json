I argue that the version of the problem of generality developed by Brandom doesn\u2019t undermine a truth-tracking account of noninferential knowledge that construes truth-tacking in terms of conditional probabilities. I then consider Sherrilyn Roush\u2019s claim that an account of knowledge based on probabilistic tracking faces a version of the problem of generality. I argue that the problems she raises are specific to her account, and do not affect the version of the view that I have advanced. I then consider Brandom\u2019s argument that the cases that motivate reliabilist epistemologies are in principle exceptional. I argue that he has failed to make a cogent case for this claim. I close with the suggestion that the representationalist approach to knowledge that I endorse and Brandom rejects is in principle compatible with the kind of pragmatist approach to belief and truth that both Brandom and I endorse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belief", "Inferentialism", "Knowledge", "Pragmatism", "Probabilistic tracking", "Problem of generality", "Reliabilism", "Representationalism", "Robert Brandom", "Truth", "Truth tracking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026485697", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"12765226500": {"Name": "Zalabardo J.", "AuthorID": "12765226500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Philosophy Department, University College London"}}}
