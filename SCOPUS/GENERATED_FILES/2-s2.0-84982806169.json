Scientific knowledge about behavior change could be more effectively accumulated using \u201contologies.\u201d In information science, an ontology is a systematic method for articulating a \u201ccontrolled vocabulary\u201d of agreed-upon terms and their inter-relationships. It involves three core elements: (1) a controlled vocabulary specifying and defining existing classes; (2) specification of the inter-relationships between classes; and (3) codification in a computer-readable format to enable knowledge generation, organization, reuse, integration, and analysis. This paper introduces ontologies, provides a review of current efforts to create ontologies related to behavior change interventions and suggests future work. This paper was written by behavioral medicine and information science experts and was developed in partnership between the Society of Behavioral Medicine\u2019s Technology Special Interest Group (SIG) and the Theories and Techniques of Behavior Change Interventions SIG. In recent years significant progress has been made in the foundational work needed to develop ontologies of behavior change. Ontologies of behavior change could facilitate a transformation of behavioral science from a field in which data from different experiments are siloed into one in which data across experiments could be compared and/or integrated. This could facilitate new approaches to hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery in behavioral science.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior change interventions", "Behaviors", "Controlled vocabularies", "Mechanisms of action", "Ontologies", "Taxonomies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Medical Informatics Computing", "Semantics", "Software", "Vocabulary, Controlled"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982806169", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8207010500": {"Name": "Larsen K.R.", "AuthorID": "8207010500", "AffiliationID": "60093261, 60000221", "AffiliationName": "Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "23034393200": {"Name": "Hekler E.B.", "AuthorID": "23034393200", "AffiliationID": "60015864", "AffiliationName": "School of Nutrition and Health Promotion, Arizona State University"}, "55776568400": {"Name": "Gibson B.", "AuthorID": "55776568400", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah"}, "6603006948": {"Name": "Spruijt-Metz D.", "AuthorID": "6603006948", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Center for Economic and Social Research, University of Southern California"}, "7004450011": {"Name": "Ahern D.", "AuthorID": "7004450011", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "35558277500": {"Name": "Cole-Lewis H.", "AuthorID": "35558277500", "AffiliationID": "60010584", "AffiliationName": "Johnson and Johnson Health and Wellness Solutions"}, "55524145400": {"Name": "Ellis R.J.B.", "AuthorID": "55524145400", "AffiliationID": "60002829", "AffiliationName": "Indiana University School of Nursing"}, "9941929100": {"Name": "Hesse B.", "AuthorID": "9941929100", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "35501362100": {"Name": "Moser R.P.", "AuthorID": "35501362100", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral Research Program, National Cancer Institute"}, "9037019300": {"Name": "Yi J.", "AuthorID": "9037019300", "AffiliationID": "100358330", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutch"}}}
