These cross sections are based on ab initio R-matrix calculations augmented by other procedures. Cross sections are presented for elastic collisions, momentum transfer, dissociative electron attachment, electron impact dissociation, ionisation and dissociative ionisation. For NF process occurring via the metastable a 1\u0394 and b 1\u03a3+ states are also considered. A semi-empirical method of estimating the products of electron impact ionisation is proposed and tested for ammonia. The cross sections are extended to high energy where appropriate. The cross section set constructed is tested in a global model simulation of a low pressure, inductively coupled plasma based on a Ar/NF3/O2 initial gas mixture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron collisions", "Etching plasma", "Molecular data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dissociative electron attachment", "Electron collision", "Electron impact dissociation", "Etching plasma", "Molecular data", "R-matrix calculation", "Remote plasma sources", "Semi-empirical methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020899046", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57139414500": {"Name": "Hamilton J.R.", "AuthorID": "57139414500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College, London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College, London"}, "55879595800": {"Name": "Huang S.", "AuthorID": "55879595800", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan"}, "7101995586": {"Name": "Kushner M.J.", "AuthorID": "7101995586", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan"}}}
