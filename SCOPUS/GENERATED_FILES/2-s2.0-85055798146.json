One of these NtrC-activated genes is yeaG, which encodes a conserved bacterial kinase. Although it is known that YeaG is required for optimal survival under sustained N starvation, the molecular basis by which YeaG benefits N starved E. coli remains elusive. By combining transcriptomics with targeted metabolomics analyses, we demonstrate that the methionine biosynthesis pathway becomes transcriptionally dysregulated in \u2206yeaG bacteria experiencing sustained N starvation. It appears the ability of MetJ, the master transcriptional repressor of methionine biosynthesis genes, to effectively repress transcription of genes under its control is compromised in \u2206yeaG bacteria under sustained N starvation, resulting in transcriptional derepression of MetJ-regulated genes. Although the aberrant biosynthesis does not appear to be a contributing factor for the compromised viability of \u2206yeaG bacteria experiencing sustained N starvation, this study identifies YeaG as a novel regulatory factor in E. coli affecting the transcription of methionine biosynthesis genes under sustained N starvation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Escherichia coli", "Methionine biosynthesis", "MetJ", "Nitrogen starvation", "Transcription regulation", "Transcription repressor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apoproteins", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial", "Methionine", "Nitrogen", "PII Nitrogen Regulatory Proteins", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Repressor Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055798146", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"]], "AuthorData": {"56528525300": {"Name": "Switzer A.", "AuthorID": "56528525300", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "55204978000": {"Name": "Figueira R.", "AuthorID": "55204978000", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "56902725200": {"Name": "Brown D.", "AuthorID": "56902725200", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "57204263627": {"Name": "Wigneshweraraj S.", "AuthorID": "57204263627", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "36880628000": {"Name": "Evangelopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "36880628000", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacterial Metabolism and Antibiotic Research Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "8585947800": {"Name": "de Carvalho L.", "AuthorID": "8585947800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacterial Metabolism and Antibiotic Research Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
