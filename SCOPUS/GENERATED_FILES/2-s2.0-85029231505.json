This article builds on a particle-level view of collision events, in line with recently proposed subtraction methods. While conventional techniques in the field usually concentrate on probability distributions, our study is, to our knowledge, the first attempt at estimating the frequency distribution of background particles across the kinematic space inside individual collision events. In fact, while the probability distribution can generally be estimated given a model of low-energy strong interactions, the corresponding frequency distribution inside a single event typically deviates from the average and cannot be predicted a priori. We present preliminary results in this direction and establish a connection between our technique and the particle weighting methods that have been the subject of recent investigation at the Large Hadron Collider.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029231505", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57197399311": {"Name": "Colecchia F.", "AuthorID": "57197399311", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University London, Kingston Lane"}, "57111151100": {"Name": "Khan A.", "AuthorID": "57111151100", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University London, Kingston Lane"}}}
