Without metallic remnants, BRSs appear able to overcome several limitations of the existing metallic stents and provide a physiologic treatment of coronary artery pathology. Areas covered: BRS have different mechanical properties compared to the traditional metallic stents that should be taken into account during their implantation. Lesion selection, device sizing and satisfied pre-dilatation should be implemented prudently. Although intravascular imaging is not mandatory for the implantation of BRSs it may have a value in optimizing device deployment assess final results and reduce the risk of device related adverse events such as re-stenosis, or scaffold thrombosis. This review aims to reveal the crucial points about the methods of optimization in each steps of BRS implantation. Expert commentary: The target lesions for BRS should be selected meticulously. Pre-dilatation, post-dilatation and intra-vascular imaging techniques should be implemented appropriately to avoid undesirable events after scaffold implantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioresorbable scaffold", "intracoronary imaging", "intravascular ultrasound", "optical coherence tomography", "optimal stent implantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorbable Implants", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Stents", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983445043", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"23669358200": {"Name": "Tenekecioglu E.", "AuthorID": "23669358200", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, ThoraxCentre, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "56454416400": {"Name": "Suwannasom P.", "AuthorID": "56454416400", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "12777569800": {"Name": "Tateishi H.", "AuthorID": "12777569800", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, ThoraxCentre, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "15051093400": {"Name": "Onuma Y.", "AuthorID": "15051093400", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, ThoraxCentre, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, Imperial College"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56878830000": {"Name": "Abdelghani M.", "AuthorID": "56878830000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57115149800": {"Name": "Sotomi Y.", "AuthorID": "57115149800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57216171274": {"Name": "Y\u0131lmaz M.", "AuthorID": "57216171274", "AffiliationID": "106703898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Bursa Postgraduate Research and Education Hospital"}}}
