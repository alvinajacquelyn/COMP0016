Aside from orthology, the lineage-specific order and orientation of these genes are also relevant. Here, we develop a database, Plastid-LCGbase (http://lcgbase. big.ac.cn/plastid-LCGbase/), which focuses on organizational variability of plastid genes and genomes from diverse taxonomic groups. The current Plastid-LCGbase contains information from 470 plastid genomes and exhibits several unique features. First, through a genome-overview page generated fromOrganellarGenomeDRAW, it displays general arrangement of all plastid genes (circular or linear). Second, it shows patterns and modes of all paired plastid genes and their physical distances across userdefined lineages, which are facilitated by a stepwise stratification of taxonomic groups. Third, it divides the paired genes into three categories (codirectionallypaired genes or CDPGs, convergentlypaired genes or CPGs and divergently-paired genes or DPGs) and three patterns (separation, overlap and inclusion) and provides basic statistics for each species. Fourth, the gene pairing scheme is expandable, where neighboring genes can also be included in species-/lineage-specific comparisons. We hope that Plastid-LCGbase facilitates gene variation (insertion-deletion, translocation and rearrangement) and transcription-level studies of plastid genomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Nucleic Acid", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genes", "Genome, Plastid", "Internet", "Plastids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941078561", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57198728898": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57198728898", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "8679878600": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "8679878600", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60102097", "AffiliationName": "CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
