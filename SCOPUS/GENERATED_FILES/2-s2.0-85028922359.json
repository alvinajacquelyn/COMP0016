The optimization of the reaction between VCl4 and ethyl acetate via atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) was shown to produce thin films of monoclinic VO2 with excellent thermochromic properties (\u0394Tsol = 12%). The tailoring of the thermochromic and visible light transmission was shown to be possible by altering the density and morphology of the deposited films. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic-force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, ellipsometry, and UV-vis spectrometry. This article provides useful design rules for the synthesis of high-quality VO2 thin films by APCVD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028922359", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57195577102": {"Name": "Malarde D.", "AuthorID": "57195577102", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "55839956500": {"Name": "Powell M.J.", "AuthorID": "55839956500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "16744209400": {"Name": "Quesada-Cabrera R.", "AuthorID": "16744209400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "57194147541": {"Name": "Wilson R.L.", "AuthorID": "57194147541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}}}
