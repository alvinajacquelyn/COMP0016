To this end, control over protein-protein and protein-surface interactions is essential. In this study, the authors probe the interaction of human peroxiredoxin 3 with gold surfaces, a protein that has been previously identified as having potential use in nanotechnology. Analytical ultracentrifugation and transmission electron microscopy revealed the pH mediated assembly of protein toroids into tubular structures across a small pH range. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation measurements showed differences in absorbed protein mass when pH is switched from pH 8.0 to 7.2, in line with the formation of supramolecular structures observed in solution studies. Scanning tunneling microscopy under ambient conditions showed that these protein tubes form on surfaces in a concentration dependent manner, with a tendency for protein adsorption and supramolecular assembly at the edges of Au(111) terraces. Finally, self-assembled monolayer modification of Au surfaces was explored as a means to control the adsorption and orientation of pH triggered protein structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gold", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Macromolecular Substances", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Microscopy, Scanning Tunneling", "Nanotubes", "Peroxiredoxin III", "Protein Multimerization", "Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques", "Ultracentrifugation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034452300", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"32367445900": {"Name": "Domigan L.", "AuthorID": "32367445900", "AffiliationID": "119787465", "AffiliationName": "Biomolecular Interaction Centre (BIC)"}, "56563151000": {"Name": "Ashmead H.", "AuthorID": "56563151000", "AffiliationID": "60105105", "AffiliationName": "Callaghan Innovation"}, "24365763400": {"Name": "Dimartino S.", "AuthorID": "24365763400", "AffiliationID": "119787465", "AffiliationName": "Biomolecular Interaction Centre (BIC)"}, "22135651100": {"Name": "Malmstrom J.", "AuthorID": "22135651100", "AffiliationID": "60093471", "AffiliationName": "The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology"}, "57213613843": {"Name": "Pearce F.", "AuthorID": "57213613843", "AffiliationID": "119787465", "AffiliationName": "Biomolecular Interaction Centre (BIC)"}, "7005204148": {"Name": "Blunt M.", "AuthorID": "7005204148", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24523892000": {"Name": "Williams D.", "AuthorID": "24523892000", "AffiliationID": "60093471", "AffiliationName": "The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology"}, "7103097425": {"Name": "Gerrard J.", "AuthorID": "7103097425", "AffiliationID": "60093471", "AffiliationName": "The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology"}}}
