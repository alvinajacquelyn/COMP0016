Our analysis of these optical interconnects employs the time domain Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion method for the statistical analysis of the optical signal and relies on a full theoretical model and its linearized form to describe the propagation of noisy optical signals in Si-PhCWs. These models incorporate all key linear and nonlinear optical effects and the mutual interaction between free-carriers and the optical field, as well as the influence of slow-light effects on the optical field and carriers dynamics. Using these tools and employing a 512-b pseudorandom bit sequence, we have studied the dependence of BER on the key system parameters, including group-velocity, input power, and signal-to-noise ratio.", "AuthorKeywords": ["integrated optics.", "nonlinear optical signal processing", "nonlinear optics", "Optical interconnects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bit error ratio (BER)", "Comparative studies", "Nonlinear optical effects", "Nonlinear optical signal processing", "Pseudo random bit sequences", "Silicon photonic crystals", "Slow and fast light", "Theoretical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025681718", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
