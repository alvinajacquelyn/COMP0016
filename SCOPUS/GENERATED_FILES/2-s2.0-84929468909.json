The extent to which childhood environment and early life cognitive function accounts for these associations is not clear. Methods: We investigated associations of adult trunk height and leg length with cognitive function in middle age, analysing data from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development: a cohort followed from birth to age 53, 1677 of whom had data on all covariates. The four cognitive tests measured verbal ability, word list memory, verbal fluency and speed/concentration. Early life environmental measures included parental education, poverty, parental divorce, physical health, cognitive ability at age 15, own education and own adult social class. Results: After adjusting for gender, shorter trunk length was associated with lower cognitive function on all four tests and shorter leg length with lower verbal intelligence and word list memory. These associations were only partially attenuated following adjustment for childhood adversity/health but were substantially accounted for by cognitive ability at age 15. Conclusions: Shorter stature was associated with lower cognitive function at age 53, the majority of this association being accounted for by cognitive function at age 15. Reduced cognitive reserve may well account for later associations between anthropometric measures and dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anthropometry", "Body Height", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Disease Susceptibility", "Educational Status", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Growth", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reading", "Social Conditions", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom", "Verbal Behavior", "Verbal Learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929468909", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35594617600": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "35594617600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London (Institute of Psychiatry)"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, MRC National Survey of Health and Development"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, MRC National Survey of Health and Development"}}}
