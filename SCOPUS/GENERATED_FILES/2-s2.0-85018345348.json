The mathematical formulation of the EIT problem is a nonlinear and severely ill-posed inverse problem for which direct D-bar methods have proved useful in providing noise-robust conductivity reconstructions. Recent advances in D-bar methods allow for conductivity reconstructions using EIT measurement data from only part of the domain (e.g., a patient lying on their back could be imaged using only data gathered on the accessible part of the body). However, D-bar reconstructions suffer from a loss of sharp edges due to a nonlinear low-pass filtering of the measured data, and this problem becomes especially marked in the case of partial boundary data. Including a priori data directly into the D-bar solution method greatly enhances the spatial resolution, allowing for detection of underlying pathologies or defects, even with no assumption of their presence in the prior. This work combines partial data D-bar with a priori data, allowing for noise-robust conductivity reconstructions with greatly improved spatial resolution. The method is demonstrated to be effective on noisy simulated EIT measurement data simulating both medical and industrial imaging scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A priori information", "D-bar method", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Neumannto-Dirichlet map", "Partial boundary data"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018345348", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57193278986": {"Name": "Alsaker M.", "AuthorID": "57193278986", "AffiliationID": "60033432", "AffiliationName": "Gonzaga University, Mathematics Department"}, "15834413100": {"Name": "Hamilton S.J.", "AuthorID": "15834413100", "AffiliationID": "60015720", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, Marquette University"}, "56180904900": {"Name": "Hauptmann A.", "AuthorID": "56180904900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
