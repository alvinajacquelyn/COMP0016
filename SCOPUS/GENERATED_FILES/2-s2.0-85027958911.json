Different ways of extracting suitable features from the spectrograms of the micro-Doppler signatures are discussed, particularly empirical features such as Doppler bandwidth, periodicity, and others, and features extracted from singular value decomposition (SVD) vectors. High classification accuracy of armed versus unarmed personnel (between 90% and 97% depending on the walking trajectory of the people) can be achieved with a single SVD-based feature, in comparison with using four empirical features. The impact on classification performance of different aspect angles and the benefit of combining multistatic information is also evaluated in this letter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Feature extractions", "Human detection", "Micro-Doppler", "Multistatic radar", "Singular value decomposition (SVD)", "Target classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aspect angles", "Classification accuracy", "Classification performance", "Empirical features", "Human detection", "Micro-Doppler", "Target Classification", "Walking trajectory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027958911", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
