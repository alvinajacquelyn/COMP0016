Recently, these two methods showed discrepancies with an increasing number of PCR undetectable RSV-B viruses. Objectives Establish if mismatches in the primer and probe binding sites could have reduced real-time RT-PCR sensitivity. Study design Nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes were sequenced for real-time RT-PCR positive and negative samples. Primer and probe binding regions in N gene were checked for mismatches and phylogenetic analyses done to determine molecular epidemiology of these viruses. New primers and probe were designed and tested on the previously real-time RT-PCR negative samples. Results N gene sequences revealed 3 different mismatches in the probe target site of PCR negative, IFAT positive viruses. The primers target sites had no mismatches. Phylogenetic analysis of N and G genes showed that real-time RT-PCR positive and negative samples fell into distinct clades. Newly designed primers-probe pair improved detection and recovered previous PCR undetectable viruses. Conclusions An emerging RSV-B variant is undetectable by a quite widely used real-time RT-PCR assay due to polymorphisms that influence probe hybridization affecting PCR accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mismatches", "Primer", "Probe", "Real-time", "RSV", "RT-PCR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "DNA Primers", "False Negative Reactions", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Kenya", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Nucleoproteins", "Oligonucleotide Probes", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Viruses", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Viral", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Viral Fusion Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009487628", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57192954963": {"Name": "Kamau E.", "AuthorID": "57192954963", "AffiliationID": "60066705, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) \u2013 Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "36489084300": {"Name": "Agoti C.N.", "AuthorID": "36489084300", "AffiliationID": "60107199", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Human Sciences, Pwani University"}, "56160112100": {"Name": "Lewa C.S.", "AuthorID": "56160112100", "AffiliationID": "60066705, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) \u2013 Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "57192957994": {"Name": "Oketch J.", "AuthorID": "57192957994", "AffiliationID": "60066705, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) \u2013 Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "57216912585": {"Name": "Owor B.E.", "AuthorID": "57216912585", "AffiliationID": "60066705, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) \u2013 Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "56897265600": {"Name": "Otieno G.P.", "AuthorID": "56897265600", "AffiliationID": "60066705, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) \u2013 Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "24342655600": {"Name": "Bett A.", "AuthorID": "24342655600", "AffiliationID": "60066705, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Demography Department, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) \u2013 Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "7006232828": {"Name": "Nokes D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006232828", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences and WIDER, University of Warwick"}, "7004646930": {"Name": "Cane P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004646930", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Salisbury"}}}
