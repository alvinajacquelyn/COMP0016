Epilepsia Open published by Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of International League Against Epilepsy.Reported incidents of challenging behavior over a 6-month period (December 2011\u2013May 2012) were systematically recorded in young people (8\u201323 years) with epilepsy (n = 125), and a comparison group of young people without epilepsy (n = 64) at a specialist epilepsy center in the United Kingdom. Factors associated with such incidents were analyzed via regression analysis. The presence of epilepsy was not a significant predictor of recorded challenging behavior. Factors associated with increases in recorded challenging behavior on multivariable analysis in the epilepsy sample were the use of medication for behavioral/psychiatric conditions (p < 0.05) and attending the center on a residential basis (p < 0.001). In the total sample, use of medication for behavioral/psychiatric conditions (p < 0.05), younger age (p < 0.01), IQ < 50 (p < 0.01), and residential status (p < 0.001) were associated with increases in recorded challenging behavior. The presence of depression was associated with reduced challenging behavior in the total sample (p < 0.05).The association between the use of psychopharmacology and increased challenging behavior in those with epilepsy and nonepilepsy could indicate a difficult to treat behavioral/psychiatric burden, lack of treatment efficacy, and/or an increased side effect profile and needs further examination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "Behavior", "Epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070610938", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, University of Vermont"}}}
