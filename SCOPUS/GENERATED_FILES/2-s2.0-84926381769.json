We determine primary nucleation rates and nucleation kinetic parameters for adipic acid solutions by using liquid/liquid segmented flow in capillary tubes in which the crystallizing medium is partitioned into small droplets. We do so by measuring the probability of crystal presence within individual droplets under stagnant (motionless droplets) and flow (moving droplets) conditions as a function of time, droplet volume, and supersaturation. Comparing the results of the experiments with the predictions of the classical nucleation theory model and of the mononuclear nucleation mechanism model, we conclude that adipic acid nucleates mainly via a heterogeneous mechanism under both fluid dynamic conditions. Furthermore, we show that the flow conditions enhance the primary nucleation rate by increasing the kinetic parameters of the process without affecting the thermodynamic parameters. In this regard, a possible mechanism is discussed on the basis of the enhancement of the attachment frequency of nucleation caused by the internal recirculation that occurs within moving droplets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical nucleation theory", "Individual droplets", "Internal recirculations", "Nucleation kinetics", "Nucleation mechanism", "Possible mechanisms", "Primary nucleation", "Thermodynamic parameter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926381769", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56581282600": {"Name": "Rossi D.", "AuthorID": "56581282600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "56581653100": {"Name": "Candel M.A.", "AuthorID": "56581653100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "57209334032": {"Name": "Jones A.G.", "AuthorID": "57209334032", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "11939698500": {"Name": "Mazzei L.", "AuthorID": "11939698500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "19638904700": {"Name": "Kuhn S.", "AuthorID": "19638904700", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "23068399500": {"Name": "Price C.", "AuthorID": "23068399500", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "University of Strathclyde, Department of Chemical Engineering"}}}
