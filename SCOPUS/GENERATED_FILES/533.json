This report summarizes the topics and activities of the fourth edition of the annual COMBINE meeting, held in Paris during September 16-20 2013, and attended by a total of 96 people. This edition pioneered a first day devoted to modeling approaches in biology, which attracted a broad audience of scientists thanks to a panel of renowned speakers. During subsequent days, discussions were held on many subjects including the introduction of new features in the various COMBINE standards, new software tools that use the standards, and outreach efforts. Significant emphasis went into work on extensions of the SBML format, and also into community-building. This year's edition once again demonstrated that the COMBINE community is thriving, and still manages to help coordinate activities between different standards in computational systems biology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954120958", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36471561200": {"Name": "Waltemath D.", "AuthorID": "36471561200", "AffiliationID": "60003615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Rostock"}, "57201570692": {"Name": "Bergmann F.T.", "AuthorID": "57201570692", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "6507020371": {"Name": "Hucka M.", "AuthorID": "6507020371", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "15832747700": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "15832747700", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "25925695500": {"Name": "Czauderna T.", "AuthorID": "25925695500", "AffiliationID": "60072195", "AffiliationName": "IPK Gatersleben"}, "7102481723": {"Name": "Schreiber F.", "AuthorID": "7102481723", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University"}, "8881504300": {"Name": "Chaouiya C.", "AuthorID": "8881504300", "AffiliationID": "60017104", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia - IGC"}, "16202455700": {"Name": "Gleeson P.", "AuthorID": "16202455700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7004072716": {"Name": "Goble C.", "AuthorID": "7004072716", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester"}, "16229843100": {"Name": "Golebiewski M.", "AuthorID": "16229843100", "AffiliationID": "60113322", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies"}, "14056059900": {"Name": "Krebs O.", "AuthorID": "14056059900", "AffiliationID": "60113322", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies"}, "35102303000": {"Name": "Juty N.", "AuthorID": "35102303000", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60026124", "AffiliationName": "EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "7003673076": {"Name": "Le Nov\u00e8re N.", "AuthorID": "7003673076", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus"}, "7006125505": {"Name": "Mi H.", "AuthorID": "7006125505", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of preventive medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "7005856531": {"Name": "Moraru I.I.", "AuthorID": "7005856531", "AffiliationID": "60000209", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling, University of Connecticut Health Center"}, "7202313819": {"Name": "Myers C.J.", "AuthorID": "7202313819", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah"}, "7005755956": {"Name": "Nickerson D.", "AuthorID": "7005755956", "AffiliationID": "60112777, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland"}, "7101797474": {"Name": "Olivier B.G.", "AuthorID": "7101797474", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Systems Bioinformatics, VU University Amsterdam"}, "36794180200": {"Name": "Rodriguez N.", "AuthorID": "36794180200", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus"}, "55495454200": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "55495454200", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Computational Biology Unit, Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH"}, "7005940887": {"Name": "Bonnet E.", "AuthorID": "7005940887", "AffiliationID": "60030506", "AffiliationName": "Mines ParisTech"}}}
