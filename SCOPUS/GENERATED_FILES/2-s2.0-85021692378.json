The coatings retained superhydrophobicity after UV radiation for at least 175 hours, heating up to 150 \u00b0C, exposure to strong acids and bases, and various mechanical durability tests such as knife scraping, hand kneading, and multiple cycles of tape peeling 100 times. In addition, the coating treated sponge was used for continuous oil-water separation through connection with a vacuum system, the separation efficiency was greater than 95% for various liquid hydrocarbons. This substrate-independent spray coating is believed to be useful for large-scale application for both outdoor and indoor applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical durability", "Large-scale applications", "Large-scale fabrication", "Mechanical durability", "Oil water separation", "Separation efficiency", "Substrate independents", "Superhydrophobic coatings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021692378", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57193343214": {"Name": "Zhi D.", "AuthorID": "57193343214", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Applied Technology of Hybrid Nanomaterials, Henan University"}, "55152871600": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "55152871600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
