The data, previously published in [1], have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession number: GSE70280).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942249198", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56343224400": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez S.", "AuthorID": "56343224400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6506068290": {"Name": "Smith-Zubiaga I.", "AuthorID": "6506068290", "AffiliationID": "60027856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology and Animal Cell Biology, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU"}, "7102615180": {"Name": "Alonso S.", "AuthorID": "7102615180", "AffiliationID": "60027856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU"}}}
