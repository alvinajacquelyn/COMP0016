As an ex-Jesuit living in exile after the expulsion of the Society of Jesus from all Spanish territories in 1767, Viscardo had a political as much as a personal motive in designing a project that would cut the colonial ties between Spain and the New World. His plans for emancipation included the instauration of a monarchical form of government, but his design was out of touch with reality and would have hardly been taken seriously by the inhabitants had a British-backed expeditionary force reached the coasts of Chile and Peru, as he had planned. While Viscardo\u2019s Letter may have stirred a sense of creole patriotism some years after his death, the political scruples of the ancien regime based on social privileges and racial distinctions were too strong to be dismantled by mere ideals of freedom, justice and equality. Thus, effective political participation was restricted to the creole elite, whom Viscardo saw as the legitimate guarantor of social order and economic prosperity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bourbon reforms", "Colonialism", "Natural rights", "Political emancipation", "Racial heterogeneity", "Viscardo y Guzm\u00e1n"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009286584", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"25026239500": {"Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez Faraco H.", "AuthorID": "25026239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies, University College London"}}}
