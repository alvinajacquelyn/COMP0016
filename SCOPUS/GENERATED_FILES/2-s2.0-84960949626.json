Recent research has explored the extent to which inequalities in education are due to primary effects (i.e., achievement differentials) versus secondary effects (i.e., choice behaviors net of achievement). We explore educational expectations in order to consider whether variations in primary and secondary effects are associated with country variation in curricular and ability stratification. We use evidence from the PISA 2003 database to test the hypothesis that (a) greater between-school academic stratification would be associated with stronger relationships between socioeconomic status and educational expectations and (b) when this effect is decomposed, achievement differentials would explain a greater proportion of this relationship in countries with greater stratification. Results supported these hypotheses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ability stratification", "curricular tracking", "educational expectations", "educational inequality", "primary and secondary effects"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960949626", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"23470098500": {"Name": "Parker P.", "AuthorID": "23470098500", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Australian Catholic University"}, "7201585638": {"Name": "Marsh H.", "AuthorID": "7201585638", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "King Saud University"}, "54418736800": {"Name": "Jerrim J.", "AuthorID": "54418736800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55954783800": {"Name": "Schoon I.", "AuthorID": "55954783800", "AffiliationID": "60008911", "AffiliationName": "Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin"}}}
