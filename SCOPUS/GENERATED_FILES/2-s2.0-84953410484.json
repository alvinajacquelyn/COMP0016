The method is based upon the first combination of Stokes/anti-Stokes light scattering measurements and the recently developed spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS). This approach has been conceptually demonstrated by measuring material-specific temperatures within a turbid sublayer of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) through a highly diffusely scattering overlayer of poly(oxymethylene) POM (3 mm thick). Root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 0.16-0.71 \u00b0C were achieved when measuring temperatures over ranges between 24 and 45 \u00b0C. This unique capability complements the array of existing, predominantly surface-based, temperature measurement techniques. It paves the way for a wide range of topical applications including subsurface, chemically specific, noninvasive temperature measurements within translucent media including the human body, subsurface monitoring of chemical or catalytic processes in manufacture quality and process control, and research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Light scattering measurement", "Measurement of temperature", "Measuring temperature", "Noninvasive measurements", "Root mean square errors", "Spatially offset raman spectroscopies", "Subsurface monitoring", "Subsurface temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953410484", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"56900691700": {"Name": "Gardner B.", "AuthorID": "56900691700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Physics, School of Physics, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "7202511172": {"Name": "Stone N.", "AuthorID": "7202511172", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Physics, School of Physics, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
