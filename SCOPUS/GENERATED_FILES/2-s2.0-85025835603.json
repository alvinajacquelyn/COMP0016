Assembling of hollow or porous particles with the diameter larger than 100 nm into hierarchically porous aerogels is efficient but challenging for achieving a high specific surface of aerogel. In this regard, submicron-sized carbon spheres with hollow cores and microporous shells are assembled into bulk aerogels, for the first time, in the presence of two-dimensional graphene sheets as special cross-linkers. The resulting bead-to-sheet polylithic aerogels show ultra-low density (51\u201367 mg cm\u22123), high conductivity (263\u2013695 S m\u22121) and high specific surface area (569\u2013609 m2 g\u22121). An application of thermocells is demonstrated with maximum output power of 1.05 W m\u22122 and maximum energy conversion efficiency of 1.4% relative to Carnot engine, outperforming the current simple U-shaped thermocells reported elsewhere.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerogel", "Graphene", "Hollow carbon sphere", "Thermocell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy storage and conversions", "Hierarchically porous", "High specific surface area", "High-specific surfaces", "Hollow carbon spheres", "Maximum output power", "Nanoscale building blocks", "Thermocell"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025835603", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57214385875": {"Name": "Dong D.", "AuthorID": "57214385875", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Nano Science and Technology Institute, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "56291967800": {"Name": "Guo H.", "AuthorID": "56291967800", "AffiliationID": "60117396, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56623528000": {"Name": "Li G.", "AuthorID": "56623528000", "AffiliationID": "60117396, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8229657900": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "8229657900", "AffiliationID": "60117396, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57193138296": {"Name": "Yan L.", "AuthorID": "57193138296", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7401655806": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
