The surface waves excited in finite-width slabs are numerically extracted by the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. The magnitudes and decay rates of surface waves are analyzed for different materials and geometries. A general homogenization method based on the analysis of appropriately defined macroscopic fields in metamaterial cells is proposed to retrieve the effective material parameters as functions of position. The effects of surface waves on effective material parameters are studied.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Decay rate", "Effective material parameters", "Finite width", "Macroscopic fields", "Rigorous coupled wave analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019764159", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"55510328500": {"Name": "Xiong X.", "AuthorID": "55510328500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
