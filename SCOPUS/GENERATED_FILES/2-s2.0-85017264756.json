There is currently no treatment for this inherited disorder and research can be challenging due to the rarity and variability of the disease. The UK Myotonic Dystrophy Patient Registry is a patient self-enrolling online database collecting clinical and genetic information. For this cross-sectional \u201csnapshot\u201d analysis, 556 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DM1 registered between May 2012 and July 2016 were included. An almost even distribution was seen between genders and a broad range of ages was present from 8 months to 78 years, with the largest proportion between 30 and 59 years. The two most frequent symptoms were fatigue and myotonia, reported by 79 and 78% of patients, respectively. The severity of myotonia correlated with the severity of fatigue as well as mobility impairment, and dysphagia occurred mostly in patients also reporting myotonia. Men reported significantly more frequent severe myotonia, whereas severe fatigue was more frequently reported by women. Cardiac abnormalities were diagnosed in 48% of patients and more than one-third of them needed a cardiac implant. Fifteen percent of patients used a non-invasive ventilation and cataracts were removed in 26% of patients, 65% of which before the age of 50 years. The registry\u2019s primary aim was to facilitate and accelerate clinical research. However, these data also allow us to formulate questions for hypothesis-driven research that may lead to improvements in care and treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials", "Myotonic dystrophy", "Patient Registries", "Trial readiness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Cataract", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electrocardiography", "Fatigue", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement Disorders", "Myotonic Dystrophy", "Myotonin-Protein Kinase", "Registries", "Sex Factors", "Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017264756", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56611325000": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "56611325000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57192235245": {"Name": "Cordts I.", "AuthorID": "57192235245", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, RWTH Aachen University"}, "16148349400": {"Name": "Atalaia A.", "AuthorID": "16148349400", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57214915325": {"Name": "Marini-Bettolo C.", "AuthorID": "57214915325", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7003355969": {"Name": "Straub V.", "AuthorID": "7003355969", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57193209075": {"Name": "Nikolenko N.", "AuthorID": "57193209075", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57193865145": {"Name": "Jimenez-Moreno A.C.", "AuthorID": "57193865145", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57204947308": {"Name": "Thompson R.", "AuthorID": "57204947308", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7005290364": {"Name": "Lochm\u00fcller H.", "AuthorID": "7005290364", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7006504257": {"Name": "Maddison P.", "AuthorID": "7006504257", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Queen\u2019s Medical Centre"}, "12142234900": {"Name": "Phillips M.", "AuthorID": "12142234900", "AffiliationID": "60172309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55730670600": {"Name": "Roberts M.", "AuthorID": "55730670600", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55584506800": {"Name": "Rogers M.", "AuthorID": "55584506800", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, University Hospital of Wales"}, "6701612206": {"Name": "Hammans S.", "AuthorID": "6701612206", "AffiliationID": "60021009, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Neurological Centre, University Hospital of Southampton"}, "7103153648": {"Name": "Petty R.", "AuthorID": "7103153648", "AffiliationID": "60023795, 60032803", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Southern General Hospital"}, "7005900136": {"Name": "Orrell R.", "AuthorID": "7005900136", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "25944598400": {"Name": "Monckton D.G.", "AuthorID": "25944598400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7004133355": {"Name": "Hilton-Jones D.", "AuthorID": "7004133355", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7402367317": {"Name": "Turner C.", "AuthorID": "7402367317", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Neurology"}}}
