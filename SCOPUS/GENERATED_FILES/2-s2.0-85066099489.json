Mammals have eight isoforms of PI3K, divided into three classes. The class I PI3Ks generate 3-phosphoinositide lipids, which directly activate signal transduction pathways. In addition to being frequently genetically activated in cancer, similar mutations in class I PI3Ks have now also been found in a human non-malignant overgrowth syndrome and a primary immune disorder that predisposes to lymphoma. The class II and class III PI3Ks are regulators of membrane traffic along the endocytic route, in endosomal recycling and autophagy, with an often indirect effect on cell signalling. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the different PI3K classes and isoforms, focusing on recently uncovered biological functions and the mechanisms by which these kinases are activated. Deeper insight into the PI3K isoforms will undoubtedly continue to contribute to a better understanding of fundamental cell biological processes and, ultimately, of human disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Transport, Active", "Endocytosis", "Endosomes", "Humans", "Isoenzymes", "Lymphoma", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066099489", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7801342545": {"Name": "Bilanges B.", "AuthorID": "7801342545", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "50262737600": {"Name": "Posor Y.", "AuthorID": "50262737600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
