Those three fuels were derived from the conventional diesel fuel (Finnish City diesel summer grade) by blending Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) or Diglyme and Butyl-Diglyme of different quantities to make their oxygen content to be 3%, 3%, and 9%, respectively. The experimental results with three fuels named Oxy1, Oxy2, and Oxy3 show that the fuel spray development was not affected apparently by the oxygenating. Compared with the base fuel, the ignition delay to main injection was shortened by 10%, 19% and 38%, respectively. Oxygen content in the three oxygenated fuels lowered the smoke and unburned hydrcoarbon emissions, with NOx and fuel consumption penalties", "AuthorKeywords": ["diesel engine combustion", "emissions", "fuel oxygenate", "ignition"], "IndexKeywords": ["DI diesel engine", "Diesel engine combustions", "Fuel oxygenates", "Ignition delays", "Oxygen content", "Oxygenated fuel", "Rapeseed methyl ester", "Single cylinders"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943539238", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"7404036974": {"Name": "Song H.", "AuthorID": "7404036974", "AffiliationID": "60032760, 60029798", "AffiliationName": "Ford Motor Company School of Engineering, University of Hertfordshire"}, "56895984000": {"Name": "Quinton K.S.", "AuthorID": "56895984000", "AffiliationID": "60032760, 60029798", "AffiliationName": "Ford Motor Company School of Engineering, University of Hertfordshire"}, "55541772200": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "55541772200", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60032760", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University School of Engineering, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7003607190": {"Name": "Ladommatos N.", "AuthorID": "7003607190", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032760", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Engineering, University of Hertfordshire"}, "10045977100": {"Name": "Peng Z.", "AuthorID": "10045977100", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
