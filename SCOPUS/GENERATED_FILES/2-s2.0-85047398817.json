These models are developed by different disciplines and against diverse contexts to capture extrasocietal state responses to neoliberalism and globalization but leave the intrasocietal preconditions for state evolution little explored. We elaborate the concept of state intrapreneurialism as one way of understanding the interrelationship between economic and state transformation\u2013one ingredient of the intrasocietal preconditions underpinning the responses to extrasocietal changes emphasized in the post-developmental state literature. Drawing on the case of Singapore's emergence in the field of smart/sustainable urban solutions, the subsidiary contributions of this paper are to suggest intrapreneurship as a specific and enduring advantage within the developmental state model, especially when set against its limitations signalled in the post-developmental state literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["developmental state", "entrepreneurial state", "intrapreneurialism", "Singapore", "smart and sustainable urban solutions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047398817", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57189269538": {"Name": "Miao J.T.", "AuthorID": "57189269538", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Urban Studies, University of Glasgow"}, "57203076068": {"Name": "Phelps N.A.", "AuthorID": "57203076068", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
