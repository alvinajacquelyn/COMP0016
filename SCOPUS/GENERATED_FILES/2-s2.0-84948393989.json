This paper describes a repeat study which included a greater number of test luminances, a third type of lamp, and an additional, shorter duration of observation (500 ms). Luminance and distance had significant effects on expression recognition; the effect of lamp was not significant and the effect of duration was suggested to be significant only within the escarpment region of the performance versus luminance relationship. The results were used to estimate appropriate light levels for outdoor lighting. A luminance of 1.0 cd/m2 permits facial expressions to be identified with a 50% probability of correct identification at a distance of 15 m.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Affect recognition", "Expression recognition", "Facial Expressions", "Light level", "Recognition of emotion", "Spectral power distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948393989", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56571783400": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56571783400", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Arts Tower"}, "6602873224": {"Name": "Fotios S.", "AuthorID": "6602873224", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Arts Tower"}}}
