In this study, the Rr was estimated from the same Final Directions of maximum projection (FD) used for multi lead ECG automatic delineation. Power spectral analysis over the directions based on QRS complex main peak and T wave onset, peak and end spatial loops was used for Rr estimation. On a subset of the Physionet MGH/MF dataset, the proposed method yielded more accurate Rr estimates (minimum mean absolute error (MAE), 2.82 bpm) than the frequency tracking algorithm (minimum MAE, 4.53 bpm) and Fourier-based frequency estimation (minimum MAE, 4.94 bpm) using each lead alone, outperforming also the weighted multi-signal oscillator-based algorithm estimates for two or three lead (minimum MAE, 3.04 bpm). It was also shown that the FD of the three orthogonalized leads from Principal Component algorithm, improve the performance of Rr estimation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Algorithms", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiration", "Respiratory Rate", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009113621", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"36717977200": {"Name": "Noriega M.", "AuthorID": "36717977200", "AffiliationID": "60061344", "AffiliationName": "Comunications and Electronical Departament of Oriente University"}, "57192917334": {"Name": "Maranon E.", "AuthorID": "57192917334", "AffiliationID": "117951684", "AffiliationName": "Studies's Center of Neuro-science and Signal and Image Processing (CENPIS)"}, "35767133300": {"Name": "Romero D.", "AuthorID": "35767133300", "AffiliationID": "60105589, 60030553", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1"}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57202657967": {"Name": "Almeida R.", "AuthorID": "57202657967", "AffiliationID": "114018425", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine"}}}
