The old paradigm of 'irreversibility' of cirrhosis had been challenged in major ways, and the validity of the usage of the term 'cirrhosis' has come into question. This paper addresses aetiology-based clinicopathological concepts and features that may deserve attention because they may determine disease outcome and, specifically, patterns of regression and remodelling. A variety of therapeutic interventions may influence remaining disease features after elimination of damaging agents (virus, alcohol, etc.), and determine the final clinical outcome including the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). New concepts create new responsibilities and opportunities for the pathologist to contribute to the understanding of liver pathology and communicate this with clinical colleagues and researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopsy", "End stage liver disease", "Fibrosis", "Liver cirrhosis", "Liver regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Biopsy", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Chronic Disease", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Diseases", "Liver Neoplasms", "Liver Regeneration", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parenchymal Tissue"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964709298", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"55357692500": {"Name": "Quaglia A.", "AuthorID": "55357692500", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital and King's College"}, "15845161000": {"Name": "Alves V.A.", "AuthorID": "15845161000", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Medicine"}, "7006941090": {"Name": "Balabaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006941090", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905, 60115930", "AffiliationName": "Inserm, U1053, Bordeaux University 2"}, "7004411044": {"Name": "Bhathal P.S.", "AuthorID": "7004411044", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Melbourne"}, "35398021800": {"Name": "Bioulac-Sage P.", "AuthorID": "35398021800", "AffiliationID": "60021564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, CHU Bordeaux"}, "35398356700": {"Name": "Crawford J.M.", "AuthorID": "35398356700", "AffiliationID": "60107658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine"}, "7101606450": {"Name": "Dhillon A.P.", "AuthorID": "7101606450", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, UCL Medical School"}, "7006046748": {"Name": "Ferrell L.", "AuthorID": "7006046748", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of California"}, "7005552862": {"Name": "Guido M.", "AuthorID": "7005552862", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine-DIMED, Pathology Unit, University of Padova"}, "35395877800": {"Name": "Hytiroglou P.", "AuthorID": "35395877800", "AffiliationID": "60015066", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Aristotle University Medical School"}, "36041241000": {"Name": "Nakanuma Y.", "AuthorID": "36041241000", "AffiliationID": "60024194", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Shizuoka Cancer Center"}, "7005731939": {"Name": "Paradis V.", "AuthorID": "7005731939", "AffiliationID": "60005915", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Department, Beaujon Hospital"}, "35876549000": {"Name": "Snover D.C.", "AuthorID": "35876549000", "AffiliationID": "60030760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Fairview Southdale Hospital"}, "7005139546": {"Name": "Theise N.D.", "AuthorID": "7005139546", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60027954", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pathology and Medicine (Division of Digestive Diseases), Beth Israel Medical Center of Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "35392441200": {"Name": "Thung S.N.", "AuthorID": "35392441200", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "16317773800": {"Name": "Tsui W.M.S.", "AuthorID": "16317773800", "AffiliationID": "60021808", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Caritas Medical Centre"}, "7006904452": {"Name": "van Leeuwen D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006904452", "AffiliationID": "60022969", "AffiliationName": "Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
