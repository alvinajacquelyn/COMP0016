The new species Ammobaculoides dhrumaensis n.sp. is described from the green shale of the D1 unit (also known as the Balum Member) of the Dhruma Formation, which has been assigned an early Bajocian age based on ammonites. Our new finding constitutes the oldest reported worldwide occurrence of the agglutinated foraminiferal genus Ammobaculoides Plummer, 1932.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040569373", "SubjectAreas": [["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"7202547764": {"Name": "Kaminski M.", "AuthorID": "7202547764", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, GeoSciences Department"}, "57200279910": {"Name": "Hammad Malik M.", "AuthorID": "57200279910", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, GeoSciences Department"}, "35307902700": {"Name": "Setoyama E.", "AuthorID": "35307902700", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Geoscience Institute, University of Utah"}}}
