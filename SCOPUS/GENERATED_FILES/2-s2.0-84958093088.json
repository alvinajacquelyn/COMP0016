All rights reserved.Objective: We hypothesised that abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) would predict outcome in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) better than current echocardiographic measures. Methods: Retrospective analysis of risk markers in relation to outcomes in 472 patients with HCM at a single tertiary institution (2006-2012). Exclusion criteria were left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of other origin, patients in atrial fibrillation, lost to follow-up and insufficient image quality to perform strain analysis. Standardised echocardiogram recordings were reviewed and standard variables and LV GLS were measured. The primary end-point included all cardiac deaths, appropriate defibrillator shocks and heart failure (HF) admissions. The secondary end-point was death by HF and admissions related to HF. Results: Mean age was 50.0\u00b115.0 years; 322 (68%) were men. At a median of 4.3 years (IQR 0.1-7.8) follow-up, 21 (4.4%) patients experienced cardiovascular death: 6 (1.3%) died from HF, 13 (2.7%) had sudden cardiac death and 2 (0.4%) died secondary to stroke. Four (0.8%) patients experienced appropriate defibrillator shock, and 13 (2.7%) were admitted for HF. On multivariate Fine-Gray proportional hazard analyses, GLS was significantly associated with the primary endpoint (HR=0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.98, p=0.018) independently of age, maximal provoked LV outflow-tract gradient and LV end-systolic volume. Moreover, GLS was particularly associated with the secondary end-point (HR=0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90, p<0.0001) independently of age, previous atrial fibrillation, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, LV end-systolic volume, E/E\u2032, and outflow-tract gradient. Survival curves confirmed that GLS was associated with HF events (GLS <15.6%, p=0.0035). Conclusions: In patients with HCM, reduced GLS is an independent factor associated with poor cardiac outcomes, and particularly HF outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Cause of Death", "Echocardiography, Doppler, Color", "Echocardiography, Doppler, Pulsed", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Contraction", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Mechanical", "Time Factors", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958093088", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6507624424": {"Name": "Reant P.", "AuthorID": "6507624424", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "University of Bordeaux, CHU de Bordeaux"}, "19337718800": {"Name": "Mirabel M.", "AuthorID": "19337718800", "AffiliationID": "60030857, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou"}, "55645073800": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "55645073800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56040042000": {"Name": "Lopez Ayala J.M.", "AuthorID": "56040042000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6602439377": {"Name": "Dickie S.", "AuthorID": "6602439377", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "24481305600": {"Name": "Guttmann O.", "AuthorID": "24481305600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "24177947000": {"Name": "Demetrescu C.", "AuthorID": "24177947000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6508359030": {"Name": "Pantazis A.", "AuthorID": "6508359030", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8786523100": {"Name": "Tome-Esteban M.", "AuthorID": "8786523100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56672467900": {"Name": "McKenna W.J.", "AuthorID": "56672467900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "23971177600": {"Name": "Peyrou J.", "AuthorID": "23971177600", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "University of Bordeaux, CHU de Bordeaux"}, "7004141972": {"Name": "Lafitte S.", "AuthorID": "7004141972", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "University of Bordeaux, CHU de Bordeaux"}}}
