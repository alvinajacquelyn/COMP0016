Research in code review is highly dependant on real-world data, and although existing researchers have attempted to provide code review datasets, there is still no dataset that links code reviews with complete versions of the system's code base mainly because reviewed versions are not kept in the system's version control repository. Thus, we present CROP, the Code Review Open Platform, the first curated code review repository that links review data with isolated complete versions (snapshots) of the source code at the time of review. CROP currently provides data for 8 software systems, 48,975 reviews and 112,617 patches, including versions of the systems that are inaccessible in the systems' original repositories. Moreover, CROP is extensible, and it will be continuously curated and extended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["code review", "platform", "repository", "software change analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Code review", "Open platforms", "platform", "repository", "Software change", "Software systems", "Source code changes", "Version control"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051661303", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55837555300": {"Name": "Paixao M.", "AuthorID": "55837555300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603760534": {"Name": "Krinke J.", "AuthorID": "6603760534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55892312600": {"Name": "Han D.", "AuthorID": "55892312600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook, University College London"}}}
