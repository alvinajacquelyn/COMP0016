These systems represent nontrivial examples of integrable dynamics and are analysed from the point of view of the energy-momentum mapping from the phase space to the space of the integration constants. In this setting, we describe the structure of the scattering trajectories in phase space and derive an explicit description of the bifurcation diagram, i.e., the set of critical value of the energy-momentum map.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923803575", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"]], "AuthorData": {"36167084600": {"Name": "Seri M.", "AuthorID": "36167084600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
