There is also increasing awareness of the importance of greater patient activation. Patients may use various types of patient-held information about medication (PHIMed) to facilitate medication transfer, which may be paper or electronic. However, it is not known how PHIMed should best be used, whether it improves patient outcomes, nor is its key \u20ac active ingredients' known. Discussion with patients and carers has highlighted this as a priority for research. We aim to identify how PHIMed is used in practice, barriers and facilitators to its use and key features of PHIMed that support medicines optimisation in practice. Methods and analysis This study will take place in Greater London, England. We will include patients with long-term conditions, carers and healthcare professionals. The study has four work packages (WPs). WP1 involves qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals (n=16) and focus groups with patients and carers (n=20), including users and non-users of PHIMed, to study perceptions around its role, key features, barriers and facilitators, and any unintended consequences. WP2 will involve documentary analysis of how PHIMed is used, what is documented and read, and by whom, in a stratified sample of 60 PHIMed users. In WP3, we will carry out a descriptive analysis of PHIMed tools used/available, both electronic and paper, and categorise their design and key features based on those identified in WP1/2. Finally, in WP4, findings from WPs 1-3 will be integrated and analysed using distributed cognition as a theoretical framework to explore how information is recorded, transformed and propagated among different people and artefacts. Ethics and dissemination The study has National Health Service ethics approval. It will provide initial recommendations around the present use of PHIMed to optimise patient care for patients, carers and healthcare professionals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["medication", "patient activation", "patient held records", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Caregivers", "Electronic Health Records", "England", "Focus Groups", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Medication Reconciliation", "Patients", "Qualitative Research", "Research Design", "Transitional Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049137555", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7006508035": {"Name": "Garfield S.", "AuthorID": "7006508035", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57189212199": {"Name": "Husson F.", "AuthorID": "57189212199", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medication Safety and Service Quality, Imperial College, Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57202729196": {"Name": "Turley M.", "AuthorID": "57202729196", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medication Safety and Service Quality, Imperial College, Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57196257915": {"Name": "Dean Franklin B.", "AuthorID": "57196257915", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "36165110400": {"Name": "Furniss D.", "AuthorID": "36165110400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College London"}}}
