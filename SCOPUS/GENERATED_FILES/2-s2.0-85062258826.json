We then review the implications for the star's physical parameters and the consequences for the interpretation of P phot, the 1.78-d photometric period. Theinferred mass, radius, and luminosity are securely established to be less than canonical values for the spectral type and are not in agreement with single-star evolution models. The runaway status, rapid rotation, and anomalous physical properties are all indicative of an evolutionary history involving binary (or multiple-star) interaction. The equatorial rotation period is <3.7 d (with 95 per cent confidence), ruling out a proposed 1/45.1-d value. If the photometric period is the rotation period then i, the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight, is 33 rm d-.g2 \u00b1 1 rm d-.g8. We perform simple star-spot modelling to show that the low axial inclination required if P rot = 1.78 d has testable spectroscopic consequences, which have not been identified in existing time series. If P phot is directly related to drivers of systematic, high-velocity stellar-wind variability ('discrete absorption components') in Pup, antisolar differential rotation is required. Model line profiles calculated on that basis are at variance with observations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["stars: distances", "stars: fundamental parameters", "stars: individual: Pup", "stars: rotation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062258826", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7004055028": {"Name": "Howarth I.D.", "AuthorID": "7004055028", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7103403300": {"Name": "Van Leeuwen F.", "AuthorID": "7103403300", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}}}
