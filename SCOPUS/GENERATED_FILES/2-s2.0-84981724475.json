This approach, I argue, overlooks the essential role of cognitive phenomenology in the mastery of the concept of self. I suggest that a better model is to be found in a different kind of representation: phenomenal concepts or more generally phenomenally grounded concepts. I start with what I take to be the defining feature of the concept of self, namely its \u201csuper-reflexivity\u201d: to use this concept is not just to think of oneself, but to think of oneself as the thinker of the present thought. I call this familiar observation the \u201cThinker Intuition\u201d. I review some shortcomings of the indexical model of the concept of self, which is the classical account of the Thinker Intuition. I go on to propose a different account, the \u201cphenomenal model\u201d, according to which the concept of self is a phenomenally grounded concept, anchored in a generic kind of cognitive phenomenology: the phenomenology of intellection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive phenomenology", "indexicality", "phenomenal concepts", "super-reflexivity", "the concept of self", "the phenomenology of intellection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981724475", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57190616914": {"Name": "Guillot M.", "AuthorID": "57190616914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
