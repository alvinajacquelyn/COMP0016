Augmentation index (AIx) reflects adverse loading exerted on the heart and large arteries and predicts future cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to establish whether endurance athletes possess lower AIx and aortic blood pressure compared to healthy controls, and to determine the association between AIx and cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods: Forty-six endurance athletes and 43 healthy controls underwent central BP and AIx measurements by non-invasive applanation tonometry before a maximal exercise test. Peak oxygen uptake (V\u02d9 O 2 peak) was assessed by pulmonary analysis. Results: Relative to controls, athletes had significantly lower brachial diastolic blood pressure (BP, \u22124.8 mmHg, p < 0.01), central systolic BP (\u22123.5 mmHg, p = 0.07), and AIx at a heart rate of 75 beats min\u22121 (AIx@75, \u221211.9 %, p < 0.001). No AIx@75 differences were observed between athletes and controls when adjusted for age and V\u02d9 O 2 peak [athletes vs controls mean (%) \u00b1 SE: \u22126.9 \u00b1 2.2 vs \u22125.7 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.76]. Relative to men with low V\u02d9 O 2 peak, those with moderate and high V\u02d9 O 2 peak had lower age-adjusted AIx@75 (p < 0.001). In women, those with high V\u02d9 O 2 peak had lower AIx@75 than those with low and moderate V\u02d9 O 2 peak (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The lower AIx@75 in endurance athletes is partly mediated by V\u02d9 O 2 peak. While an inverse relationship between AIx@75 and V\u02d9 O 2 peak was found in men, women with the highest V\u02d9 O 2 peak possessed lowest AIx@75 compared to females with moderate or poor cardiorespiratory fitness. We recommend aerobic training aimed at achieving a minimum V\u02d9 O 2 peak of 45 ml kg\u22121 min\u22121 to decrease the risk of future cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial stiffness", "Cardiovascular health", "Central blood pressure", "VO2max"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aorta", "Arterial Pressure", "Athletic Performance", "Cardiorespiratory Fitness", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxygen Consumption", "Physical Endurance", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sports", "Vascular Stiffness", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976315207", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55813337000": {"Name": "Denham J.", "AuthorID": "55813337000", "AffiliationID": "60010859", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Federation University Australia"}, "57189336002": {"Name": "Brown N.J.", "AuthorID": "57189336002", "AffiliationID": "60010859", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Federation University Australia"}, "13005675300": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien B.J.", "AuthorID": "13005675300", "AffiliationID": "60010859", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Federation University Australia"}, "7006672694": {"Name": "Tomaszewski M.", "AuthorID": "7006672694", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences University College London (UCL) and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) UCL/UCL Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6602114776": {"Name": "Charchar F.J.", "AuthorID": "6602114776", "AffiliationID": "60010859", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Federation University Australia"}}}
