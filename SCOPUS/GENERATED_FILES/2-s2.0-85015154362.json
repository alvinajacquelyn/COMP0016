Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors, with >50% of cases involving the gastrointestinal system or pancreas. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are used for treating NET-related secretory syndromes and, more recently, for their antiproliferative effects. We conducted a systematic review of published literature on the antiproliferative efficacy and safety of the SSA lanreotide Autogel in the management of NETs to gain a fuller understanding of the evidence and identify future areas of research. Methods. Searches were conducted in PubMed up to March 16, 2016, and in the proceedings of four congresses from 2013 to 2016. Results. Screening of 1,132 publications identified in the searches found 40 relevant publications, including 27 fulllength publications and 13 congress abstracts. Twenty-four of these publications reported antiproliferative efficacy data for lanreotide Autogel. The CLARINET study showed that 120 mg lanreotide Autogel every 4 weeks improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NETs, with grade 1 or grade 2 (Ki-67 <10%) disease, providing class I evidence of its antiproliferative effects. The CLARINET open-label extension study reported a median PFS of 32.8 months with lanreotide Autogel. Other smaller studies generally support CLARINET. Conclusion. Current clinical evidence shows that lanreotide Autogel has good antiproliferative activity with favorable safety and tolerability in patients with GEP-NETs, suggesting it should be considered as an early first-line treatment in this population. Further studies are needed to assess the potential benefits of higher doses and the use of lanreotide Autogel in combination therapy and as maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression following other therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Proliferation", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Disease-Free Survival", "Humans", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Peptides, Cyclic", "Somatostatin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015154362", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57211284397": {"Name": "Michael M.", "AuthorID": "57211284397", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Neuorendocrine Service and Division of Cancer Medicine, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre"}, "6603544256": {"Name": "Garcia-Carbonero R.", "AuthorID": "6603544256", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre"}, "35444997000": {"Name": "Weber M.M.", "AuthorID": "35444997000", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Mainz"}, "6603779508": {"Name": "Lombard-Bohas C.", "AuthorID": "6603779508", "AffiliationID": "60018139", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital \u00c9douard-Herriot, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s digestives"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7401608614": {"Name": "Hicks R.J.", "AuthorID": "7401608614", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Imaging and Neuroendocrine Service and Molecular Imaging and Targeted Therapeutics Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre"}}}
