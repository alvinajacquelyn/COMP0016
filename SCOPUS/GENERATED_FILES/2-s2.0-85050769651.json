Here we report, using murine models of breast cancer, that TAMs expressing fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) and haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which are also found in human breast cancer, represent a macrophage phenotype similar to that observed during the wound healing response. Importantly, the expression of a wound-like cytokine response within the tumour is clinically associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. We show that co-expression of FAP and HO-1 in macrophages results from an innate early regenerative response driven by IL-6, which both directly regulates HO-1 expression and licenses FAP expression in a skin-like collagen-rich environment. We show that tumours can exploit this response to facilitate transendothelial migration and metastatic spread of the disease, which can be pharmacologically targeted using a clinically relevant HO-1 inhibitor.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Collagen", "Cytokines", "Female", "Gelatinases", "Gene Expression
