Echographic characteristics of the lymph nodes were collected in both categories. In the EBUS-elastography group elastographic data were also determined.Results:A total of 100 lymph nodes were evaluated. Group 1 (EBUS) consisted of 57 lymph nodes. Group 2 (EBUS-elastography) included 43 lymph nodes. In group 2 lymph nodes with predominantly blue pattern were associated with a pathologic determination of malignancy and the probability of presenting malignant infiltration with this color pattern was 86.7% (P=0.00004). Malignant lymph nodes presented less color dispersion (48.8 vs. 94.8 P=0.00013) higher ratio of blue pixels (66% vs. 32.5% P=0.016) and higher strain ratio (7.1 vs. 2.48 P=0.005). The cut-off points to distinguish between benign and malignant lymph nodes were 4 for strain ratio 61 for frequency histograms and 52 for blue pixel ratio. The area under the curve of the ROC curves were 0.75 0.83 and 0.87 respectively. Group 2 presented a lower number of nondiagnostic samples (2.3% vs. 21% P=0.001) and a higher rate of malignant results (42% vs. 16% P=0.005).Conclusion:EBUS-elastography is feasible during EBUS and may be helpful in predicting malignant lymph node infiltration. It could improve anatomopathologic sample collection and increase diagnostic efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elastography", "endobronchial ultrasound", "hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Area Under Curve", "Bronchoscopy", "Color", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Endosonography", "False Negative Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "Lung", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Mediastinum", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054989178", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57204213971": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez Roca M.", "AuthorID": "57204213971", "AffiliationID": "121467539", "AffiliationName": "Rafael M\u00e9ndez General University Hospital"}, "57204211576": {"Name": "Lozano VICente D.", "AuthorID": "57204211576", "AffiliationID": "121467539", "AffiliationName": "Rafael M\u00e9ndez General University Hospital"}, "57197747026": {"Name": "Wasniewski S.", "AuthorID": "57197747026", "AffiliationID": "121467539", "AffiliationName": "Rafael M\u00e9ndez General University Hospital"}, "57204213670": {"Name": "El\u00edas Torregrosa C.", "AuthorID": "57204213670", "AffiliationID": "121467539", "AffiliationName": "Rafael M\u00e9ndez General University Hospital"}, "35786651200": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez Pallar\u00e9s J.", "AuthorID": "35786651200", "AffiliationID": "115364967", "AffiliationName": "Santa Luc\u00eda General University Hospital"}, "13613417700": {"Name": "Valdivia Salas M.D.M.", "AuthorID": "13613417700", "AffiliationID": "115364967", "AffiliationName": "Santa Luc\u00eda General University Hospital"}, "6603472216": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Solano J.", "AuthorID": "6603472216", "AffiliationID": "115364967", "AffiliationName": "Santa Luc\u00eda General University Hospital"}, "57212911956": {"Name": "Santa Cruz Siminiani A.", "AuthorID": "57212911956", "AffiliationID": "115364967", "AffiliationName": "Santa Luc\u00eda General University Hospital"}, "24478918700": {"Name": "Prieto Merino D.", "AuthorID": "24478918700", "AffiliationID": "60109394", "AffiliationName": "San Antonio Catholic University"}, "57204216990": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez J.", "AuthorID": "57204216990", "AffiliationID": "60002467", "AffiliationName": "Morales Meseguer General University Hospital"}, "57188660867": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez D\u00edaz J.J.", "AuthorID": "57188660867", "AffiliationID": "122818815", "AffiliationName": "Almansa General Hospital Almansa Albacete"}}}
