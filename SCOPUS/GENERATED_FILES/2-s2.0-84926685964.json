Aims: To examine whether longer-term (maintenance) CST is cost-effective when added to usual care. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis within multicenter, single-blind, pragmatic randomized controlled trial; subgroup analysis for people taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACHEIs). A total of 236 participants with mild-to-moderate dementia received CST for 7weeks. They were randomized to either weekly maintenance CST added to usual care or usual care alone for 24weeks. Results: Although outcome gains were modest over 6months, maintenance CST appeared cost-effective when looking at self-rated quality of life as primary outcome, and cognition (MMSE) and proxy-rated quality-adjusted life years as secondary outcomes. CST in combination with ACHEIs offered cost-effectiveness gains when outcome was measured as cognition. Conclusions: Continuation of CST is likely to be cost-effective for people with mild-to-moderate dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors", "Cognitive stimulation therapy", "Cost", "Cost-effectiveness", "Dementia", "Randomized controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Cognitive Therapy", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Quality of Life", "Single-Blind Method", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926685964", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57191998352": {"Name": "D'Amico F.", "AuthorID": "57191998352", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "56586242200": {"Name": "Rehill A.", "AuthorID": "56586242200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7202388606": {"Name": "Knapp M.", "AuthorID": "7202388606", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "36088851100": {"Name": "Aguirre E.", "AuthorID": "36088851100", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Care Research Centre, Research and Development Department, Goodmayes Hospital, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54405136100": {"Name": "Streater A.", "AuthorID": "54405136100", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Care Research Centre, Research and Development Department, Goodmayes Hospital, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56193592300": {"Name": "Donovan H.", "AuthorID": "56193592300", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychology Service, South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12242711600": {"Name": "Hoare Z.", "AuthorID": "12242711600", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "North Wales Organisation for Randomised Trials in Health (NWORTH), Institute of Medical and Social Care Research"}, "7007047838": {"Name": "Whitaker C.", "AuthorID": "7007047838", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "North Wales Organisation for Randomised Trials in Health (NWORTH), Institute of Medical and Social Care Research"}, "6603687595": {"Name": "Hoe J.", "AuthorID": "6603687595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7201981270": {"Name": "Russell I.", "AuthorID": "7201981270", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Swansea University"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7101638963": {"Name": "Woods R.T.", "AuthorID": "7101638963", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "DSDC Wales, Bangor University"}}}
