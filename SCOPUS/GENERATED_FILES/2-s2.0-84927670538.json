Methods: Participants (n = 229, 46.7% female) were young people (mean 8.8 years [SD \u00b1 2.2]) from the borough of Camden, UK. Daily sedentary time, moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA) and light exposure were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer with an ambient light sensor during the summer. Multiple linear regression models examined associations between average daily light exposure, sedentary time and time in MVPA. Models were repeated investigating weekdays and weekend days separately. Analyses were adjusted for pre-specified covariables, including age, sex, device wear time, ethnic group, school and body fat. Results: There were significant associations between average daily light exposure and time sedentary (\u03b2 coefficient = \u221211.2, 95% CI, \u221219.0 to \u22123.4) and in MVPA (\u03b2 coefficient = 3.5, 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.9). Light exposure was significantly associated with weekend sedentary time (\u03b2 coefficient = \u221210.0, 95% CI, \u221217.6, \u22122.4), weekend MVPA (\u03b2 coefficient = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.7, 5.7), weekday sedentary time (\u03b2 coefficient = \u221215.0, 95% CI, \u221222.7 to \u22127.2), but not weekday MVPA (\u03b2 coefficient = 2.0, 95% CI, \u22120.5 to 4.5). Conclusion: Average daily light exposure is positively associated with time in MVPA and negatively associated with sedentary time. Increasing daylight exposure may be a useful intervention strategy for promoting physical activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Adolescents", "Children", "Outdoors", "Sitting time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Photoperiod", "Schools", "Sedentary Lifestyle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927670538", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"55219956400": {"Name": "Aggio D.", "AuthorID": "55219956400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56660238600": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "56660238600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
