Methods: In time-mated pregnant does a left diaphragmatic defect was created at d23 (term=31). At d28, previously operated fetuses were assigned to either TO and injection with 70\u03bcL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 1.0\u00d7106 c-Kit positive hAFSC expressing LacZ or were left untouched (CDH). Harvesting was done at d31 to obtain their lung-to-body weight ratio (LBWR), airway and vascular lung morphometry, X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and surfactant protein-B (SP-B). Results: CDH-induced pulmonary hypoplasia is countered by TO+PBS, this reverses LBWR, mean terminal bronchiole density (MTBD) and medial thickness to normal. The additional injection of hAFSC decreases MTBD and results in a non-significant decrease in muscularization of intra-acinary vessels. There were no inflammatory changes and LacZ positive hAFSC were dispersed throughout the lung parenchyma 4days after injection. Conclusion: HAFSC exert an additional effect on TO leading to a decrease in MTBD, a measure of alveolar number surrounding the terminal bronchioles, without signs of toxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Amniotic Fluid", "Animals", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Fetal Organ Maturity", "Fetal Stem Cells", "Fetal Therapies", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Diseases", "Rabbits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940791540", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"35326372700": {"Name": "Dekoninck P.", "AuthorID": "35326372700", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "6504592094": {"Name": "Toelen J.", "AuthorID": "6504592094", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "6506321647": {"Name": "Roubliova X.", "AuthorID": "6506321647", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "35171359600": {"Name": "Russo F.M.", "AuthorID": "35171359600", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "37038341600": {"Name": "Richter J.", "AuthorID": "37038341600", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "56692807100": {"Name": "Vandersloten P.J.", "AuthorID": "56692807100", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "7006218373": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "7006218373", "AffiliationID": "60070033, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Organ systems cluster, Department of Development and Regeneration, and Center for Surgical Technologies, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "57209592829": {"Name": "Carter S.", "AuthorID": "57209592829", "AffiliationID": "60121204, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Biology and Engineering Research Center, Department of Development and Regeneration, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "6602197182": {"Name": "Pozzobon M.", "AuthorID": "6602197182", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Lab, Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Citt\u00e0 della Speranza, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova"}, "35988923000": {"Name": "Verbeken E.", "AuthorID": "35988923000", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Group Biomedical Sciences, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "24801882300": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "24801882300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond St Hospital"}}}
