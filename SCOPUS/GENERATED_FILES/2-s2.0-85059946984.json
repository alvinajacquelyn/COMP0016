The method and the NZSEE guidelines have been enhanced from the 2006 version, resulting into an efficient procedure, balancing simplicity and accuracy. This paper presents a numerical study, initiated as part of the development of the SLaMA-2017 method, to investigate the accuracy of the analytical approach via comparison with numerical 2D-pushover on 40 RC frames. SLaMA is effective in capturing the plastic mechanism of the frames, including global or soft-story mechanisms. Further-yet-simple refinements of the procedure are suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["displacement-based assessment", "existing buildings", "nonlinear analysis", "reinforced concrete", "Seismic assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical approach", "Displacement-Based", "Mechanism analysis", "New zealand", "Plastic mechanism", "RC frames", "Seismic assessment", "Soft story"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059946984", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"56868328600": {"Name": "Gentile R.", "AuthorID": "56868328600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "56278059800": {"Name": "del Vecchio C.", "AuthorID": "56278059800", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture, University of Napoli Federico II"}, "7801638248": {"Name": "Pampanin S.", "AuthorID": "7801638248", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6508087627": {"Name": "Raffaele D.", "AuthorID": "6508087627", "AffiliationID": "60022778, 60027299", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental, Landscape, Building Engineering and Chemistry, Polytechnic University of Bari"}, "12143743700": {"Name": "Uva G.", "AuthorID": "12143743700", "AffiliationID": "60022778, 60027299", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental, Landscape, Building Engineering and Chemistry, Polytechnic University of Bari"}}}
