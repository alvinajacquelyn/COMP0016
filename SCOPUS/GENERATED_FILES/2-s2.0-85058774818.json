Here we reliably form millions of identical nanocavities and show that the light can be further focused down to the subnanometer scale via the creation of picocavities, single-adatom protrusions with angstrom-level resolution. For the first time, we stabilize and analyze these cavities at room temperatures through high-speed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy on specifically selected molecular components, collecting and analyzing more than 2 million spectra. Data obtained on these picocavities allows us to deduce structural information on the nanoscale, showing that thiol binding to gold destabilizes the metal surface to optical irradiation. Nitrile moieties are found to stabilize picocavities by 10-fold against their disappearance, typically surviving for >1 s. Such constructs demonstrate the accessibility of single-molecule chemistry under ambient conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Angstrom-level resolution", "Molecular components", "Optical irradiation", "Single molecule level", "Single-molecule chemistry", "Structural information", "Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy", "Temperature optical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058774818", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57189852253": {"Name": "Carnegie C.", "AuthorID": "57189852253", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "57213146447": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "57213146447", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "24398314800": {"Name": "De Nijs B.", "AuthorID": "24398314800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "56648146200": {"Name": "Readman C.", "AuthorID": "56648146200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "54941185500": {"Name": "Chikkaraddy R.", "AuthorID": "54941185500", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "57194055666": {"Name": "Deacon W.M.", "AuthorID": "57194055666", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "7007021640": {"Name": "Baumberg J.J.", "AuthorID": "7007021640", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "57190172653": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3 I.", "AuthorID": "57190172653", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "55917943500": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55917943500", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences, Microscale and Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7003686501": {"Name": "Aizpurua J.", "AuthorID": "7003686501", "AffiliationID": "60017954, 60103735, 60027856", "AffiliationName": "Materials Physics Center CSIC-UPV/EHU, Donostia International Physics Center DIPC"}}}
