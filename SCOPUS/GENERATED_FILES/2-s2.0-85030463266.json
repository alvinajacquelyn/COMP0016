Antifouling tests in artificial seawater using the marine, biofilm-forming bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus proved the coatings to be ineffective in fouling prevention but revealed a deceiving artifact from the reactive species generated at the counter electrode (CE), even for electrochemical bias potentials as low as |400| mV versus Ag|AgCl. These findings provide valuable information on the preparation of nanothin PHQ coatings and their electrochemical behavior in artificial seawater. The results further demonstrate that it is critical to isolate the CE in electrochemical anti-biofouling testing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030463266", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"55802371548": {"Name": "Larsson M.", "AuthorID": "55802371548", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}, "35577381600": {"Name": "Nyd\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "35577381600", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}, "24342243400": {"Name": "Yousefi A.", "AuthorID": "24342243400", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "55671660900": {"Name": "Elmas S.", "AuthorID": "55671660900", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}, "56205116300": {"Name": "Lind\u00e9n J.B.", "AuthorID": "56205116300", "AffiliationID": "60107281", "AffiliationName": "Research Institutes of Sweden, Division of Bioscience and Materials, Chemistry, Materials and Surfaces"}, "55925608200": {"Name": "Nann T.", "AuthorID": "55925608200", "AffiliationID": "60002316, 60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
