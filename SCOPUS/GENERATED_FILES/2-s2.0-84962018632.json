We sought to identify factors that may influence variation in detection rates by using theory-based tools for understanding behavior. Methods We separately studied gastroenterologists and endoscopy nurses at 3 Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical centers to identify potentially modifiable factors relevant to physician adenoma detection rate variability by using structured group interviews (focus groups) and theory-based tools for understanding behavior and eliciting behavior change: the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation behavior model; the Theoretical Domains Framework; and the Behavior Change Wheel. Results Nine factors potentially associated with adenoma detection rate variability were identified, including 6 related to capability (uncertainty about which types of polyps to remove, style of endoscopy team leadership, compromised ability to focus during an examination due to distractions, examination technique during withdrawal, difficulty detecting certain types of adenomas, and examiner fatigue and pain), 2 related to opportunity (perceived pressure due to the number of examinations expected per shift and social pressure to finish examinations before scheduled breaks or the end of a shift), and 1 related to motivation (valuing a meticulous examination as the top priority). Examples of potential intervention strategies are provided. Conclusions By using theory-based tools, this study identified several novel and potentially modifiable factors relating to capability, opportunity, and motivation that may contribute to adenoma detection rate variability and be appropriate targets for future intervention trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoma", "Attention", "Clinical Competence", "Colonoscopy", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Fatigue", "Focus Groups", "Gastroenterologists", "Humans", "Motivation", "Nurses", "Psychological Theory", "Quality Improvement", "Social Environment", "Workload"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962018632", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7005842007": {"Name": "Atkins L.", "AuthorID": "7005842007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7003381756": {"Name": "Hunkeler E.", "AuthorID": "7003381756", "AffiliationID": "60022056, 60017457", "AffiliationName": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"}, "57197101266": {"Name": "Jensen C.", "AuthorID": "57197101266", "AffiliationID": "60022056, 60017457", "AffiliationName": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"}, "27167897600": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "27167897600", "AffiliationID": "60022056, 60017457", "AffiliationName": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"}, "7005440034": {"Name": "Levin T.", "AuthorID": "7005440034", "AffiliationID": "60022056, 60017457", "AffiliationName": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"}, "7006039762": {"Name": "Corley D.", "AuthorID": "7006039762", "AffiliationID": "60022056, 60017457", "AffiliationName": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"}, "57195623399": {"Name": "Doubeni C.", "AuthorID": "57195623399", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7004168268": {"Name": "Zauber A.", "AuthorID": "7004168268", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7004007497": {"Name": "Quinn V.", "AuthorID": "7004007497", "AffiliationID": "60017457", "AffiliationName": "Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California"}}}
