However, within this apparently large crowd, a tiny group of highly active users is responsible for the mapping of almost all the content. One may thus wonder to what extent the information being mapped is biased towards the interests and agenda of this group of users. In this paper, we present a method to quantitatively measure content bias in crowd-sourced geographic information. We then apply the method to quantify content bias across a threeyear period of OpenStreetMap mapping in 40 countries. We find almost no content bias in terms of what is being mapped, but significant geographic bias; furthermore, we find that bias in terms of meticulousness varies with culture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Content bias", "cross-cultural", "crowd-sourcing", "OpenStreetMap", "volunteered geographic information"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collaborative Work", "Content bias", "cross-cultural", "Geographic information", "Global map", "OpenStreetMap", "Volunteered geographic information"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968756791", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55936820200": {"Name": "Quattrone G.", "AuthorID": "55936820200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507520114": {"Name": "De Meo P.", "AuthorID": "6507520114", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "University of Messina"}}}
