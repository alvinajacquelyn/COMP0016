The technology is considered advantageous because it may enable the continued utilization of fossil fuels while curbing carbon emissions. However, development of the technology remains slow on the ground. It is generally argued that large-scale, integrated demonstration projects are needed as a next step toward commercialization. Despite government support in several countries, few projects exist so far worldwide. This paper asks why it is so difficult to get demonstration projects off the ground. The argument is that it is not only project-specific factors that determine the feasibility of demonstration, but given the need for government support, a variety of political economy factors influence decision-making processes by policy makers and companies. The paper introduces an analytical framework developed on the basis of the political economy literature that considers six sets of factors that influence outcomes. It discusses two specific projects, Longannet in the UK and Quest in Canada, and explains why one failed and the other one is under construction. The analysis shows that although climate change has been a more important policy concern in the UK compared to Canada, the specific political economy situation of fossil fuel rich provinces like Alberta has led to the Quest project going forward.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Canada", "Carbon capture and storage", "Climate change mitigation", "Political economy", "Technology demonstration projects", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Canada", "Climate change mitigation", "Political economy", "Technology demonstration projects", "UK"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949497012", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"35229759300": {"Name": "Kern F.", "AuthorID": "35229759300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SPRU-Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex"}, "57209845046": {"Name": "Watson J.", "AuthorID": "57209845046", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SPRU-Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex"}, "56849339600": {"Name": "Gaede J.", "AuthorID": "56849339600", "AffiliationID": "60017592", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy, Carleton University"}, "8667228200": {"Name": "Meadowcroft J.", "AuthorID": "8667228200", "AffiliationID": "60017592", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy, Carleton University"}}}
