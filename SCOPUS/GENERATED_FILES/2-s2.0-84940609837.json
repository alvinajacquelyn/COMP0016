We used this approach to assess observational evidence on systemic inflammation in individuals with major depressive disorder. We identified 58 studies of four common inflammatory markers in a literature search of PubMed, Embase and PsychInfo databases in May 2014. Pooled data from the earliest eight studies already showed an association between interleukin-6 concentrations and major depression; 23 more recent studies confirmed this finding (d=0.54, p<0.0001). A significant association between C-reactive protein levels and major depression was noted after 14 studies and this did not change after addition of six more studies (d=0.47, p<0.0001). For these two inflammatory markers, there was moderate heterogeneity in study-specific estimates, subgroup differences were small, and publication bias appeared to be an unlikely explanation for the findings. Sensitivity analyses including only high-quality studies and subjects free of antidepressant medication further verified the associations. While there was a link between tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels and major depression (d=0.40, p=0.002), the cumulative effect remained uncertain due to the extensive heterogeneity in study-specific estimates and inconsistencies between subgroups. No evidence was found for the association between interleukin-1\u03b2 levels and major depression (. d=. -0.05, p=. 0.86). In conclusion, this cumulative meta-analysis confirmed higher mean levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in patients with major depression compared to non-depressed controls. No consistent association between tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 and major depression was observed. Future studies should clarify the specific immune mechanisms involved as well as continue testing anti-inflammatory therapies in patients suffering from major depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-reactive protein", "Cumulative meta-analysis", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-1\u03b2", "Interleukin-6", "Major depression", "Tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "C-Reactive Protein", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Interleukin-1beta", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940609837", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"12769331900": {"Name": "Haapakoski R.", "AuthorID": "12769331900", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60029080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "15749838700": {"Name": "Alenius H.", "AuthorID": "15749838700", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Systems Toxicology Unit, Centre of Expertise for Health and Work Ability"}, "57192402788": {"Name": "Mathieu J.", "AuthorID": "57192402788", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie"}, "7004932147": {"Name": "Ebmeier K.P.", "AuthorID": "7004932147", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}}}
