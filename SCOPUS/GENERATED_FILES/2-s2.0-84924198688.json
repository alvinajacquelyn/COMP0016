Polymerase (Pol) -primase initiates each synthesis event and is rapidly replaced by processive DNA polymerases: Pol\u03b5 replicates the leading strand, whereas Pol\u03b4performs lagging-strand synthesis. However, it is not known whether this division of labor is maintained across the whole genome or how uniform it is within single replicons. Using Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we have developed a polymerase usage sequencing (Pu-seq) strategy to map polymerase usage genome wide. Pu-seq provides direct replication-origin location and efficiency data and indirect estimates of replication timing. We confirm that the division of labor is broadly maintained across an entire genome. However, our data suggest a subtle variability in the usage of the two polymerases within individual replicons. We propose that this results from occasional leading-strand initiation by Pol\u03b4followed by exchange for Pol\u03b5.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA", "DNA Polymerase I", "DNA Polymerase II", "DNA Polymerase III", "DNA Replication", "Models, Genetic", "Replication Origin", "Schizosaccharomyces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924198688", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"6507138401": {"Name": "Daigaku Y.", "AuthorID": "6507138401", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}, "15727815100": {"Name": "Keszthelyi A.", "AuthorID": "15727815100", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}, "6506004885": {"Name": "Miyabe I.", "AuthorID": "6506004885", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}, "56157551400": {"Name": "Carr A.M.", "AuthorID": "56157551400", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}, "40361311000": {"Name": "M\u00fcller C.A.", "AuthorID": "40361311000", "AffiliationID": "60013801, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford"}, "6508012366": {"Name": "Nieduszynski C.A.", "AuthorID": "6508012366", "AffiliationID": "60013801, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford"}, "55531982300": {"Name": "Brooks T.", "AuthorID": "55531982300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "57203072549": {"Name": "Hubank M.", "AuthorID": "57203072549", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "6505758690": {"Name": "Retkute R.", "AuthorID": "6505758690", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Queens Medical Centre"}}}
