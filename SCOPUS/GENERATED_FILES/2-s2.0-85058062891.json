In line with the widespread expression of this pathway, NO participates in numerous different brain functions. This review gives an account of the discovery of NO as a signalling molecule in the brain, experiments that originated in the search for a mysterious cGMP-stimulating factor released from central neurones when their NMDA receptors were stimulated, and summarizes the subsequent key steps that helped establish its status as a central transmitter. Currently, various modes of operation are viewed to underlie its diverse behaviour, ranging from very local signalling between synaptic partners (in the orthograde or retrograde directions) to a volume-type transmission whereby NO synthesized by multiple synchronous sources summate spatially and temporally to influence intermingled neuronal or non-neuronal cells, irrespective of anatomical connectivity.
