Unlike existing methods that first perform pose estimation on individual cameras and generate 3D models as post-processing, our approach makes use of 3D reasoning throughout a multi-stage approach. This novelty allows us to use provisional 3D models of human pose to rethink where the joints should be located in the image and to recover from past mistakes. Our principled refinement of 3D human poses lets us make use of image cues, even from images where we previously misdetected joints, to refine our estimates as part of an end-to-end approach. Finally, we demonstrate how the high-quality output of our multi-camera setup can be used as an additional training source to improve the accuracy of existing single camera models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CNN", "Markerless MoCap"], "IndexKeywords": ["Human bodies", "Markerless", "Markerless motion capture", "Multi-cameras", "Multistage approach", "Pose estimation", "Post processing", "Single camera model"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056774022", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"57201376011": {"Name": "Tome D.", "AuthorID": "57201376011", "AffiliationID": "101041565", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "12752515600": {"Name": "Agapito L.", "AuthorID": "12752515600", "AffiliationID": "101041565", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "57198860675": {"Name": "Toso M.", "AuthorID": "57198860675", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "36601366300": {"Name": "Russell C.", "AuthorID": "36601366300", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}}}
