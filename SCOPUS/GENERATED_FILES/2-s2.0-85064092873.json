Following visual deprivation, intrinsic properties are significantly altered, although orientation selectivity across the population remains unchanged. We, therefore, suggest that cortical cells adjust their intrinsic excitability in an activity-dependent manner to compensate for changes in synaptic drive and maintain sensory network function.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsThis large-scale in vivo study by Brown et al. shows that the intrinsic and synaptic properties of V1 layer 2/3 neurons are modulated by ongoing visual input. However, despite significant changes in cellular intrinsic and synaptic properties after visual deprivation, overall functional selectivity for oriented stimuli remains unchanged.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intrinsic plasticity", "layer 2/3", "orientation selectivity", "visual cortex", "visual deprivation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Photic Stimulation", "Pyramidal Cells", "Sensation", "Sensory Deprivation", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064092873", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56384712000": {"Name": "Brown A.P.Y.", "AuthorID": "56384712000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "36871685500": {"Name": "Cossell L.", "AuthorID": "36871685500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "6602716645": {"Name": "Margrie T.W.", "AuthorID": "6602716645", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}}}
