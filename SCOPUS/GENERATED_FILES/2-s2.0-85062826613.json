A large proportion of these cDNAs would be undesirable in an iCLIP library, as it could affect the resolution of the method. To this end, we added an oligonucleotide to the 5\u2019-end of RNA fragments\u2014a 5\u2019-marker\u2014to mark the read-through cDNAs. By applying this modified iCLIP protocol to PTBP1 and eIF4A3, we found that the start sites of read-through cDNAs are enriched in adenosines, while the remaining cDNAs have a markedly different sequence content at their starts, preferentially containing thymidines. This finding in turn indicates that most of the reads in our iCLIP libraries are a product of truncation with valuable information regarding the proteins\u2019 RNA-binding sites. Thus, cDNA start sites confidently identify a protein\u2019s RNA-crosslink sites and we can account for the impact of read-through cDNAs by commonly adding a 5\u2019-marker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3)", "High-throughput sequencing", "iCLIP", "Polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1)", "Protein-RNA interactions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062826613", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55928963700": {"Name": "Huppertz I.", "AuthorID": "55928963700", "AffiliationID": "60007257", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)"}, "55356372800": {"Name": "Haberman N.", "AuthorID": "55356372800", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
