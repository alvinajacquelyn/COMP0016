METHODS: Eight methods were used simultaneously in data collection: vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), ground reaction forces (GRF), 1 linear position transducer (1LPT), 1LPT and VGRF (1LPT+VGRF), 2 linear position transducers (2LPTs), 2LPTs and VGRF (2LPTs+VGRF), 5 linear position transducers (5LPTs), 5LPTs and GRF (5LPTs+GRF). Power output was calculated for each lift according to the sensor or sensors used and the results were compared. RESULTS: Power output calculated separately with LPTs and GRF method did not differ significantly from combined methods such as 1LPT+VGRF, 2LPTs+VGRF. No significant differences were found when comparing power output between 5LPTs+GRF and combined methods such as 2LPTs+VGRF. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that test methodology with a simple single linear position transducer setup and or force platform suffice when recording vertical jump such as loaded squat jump.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Athletic performance", "Muscle strength", "Plyometric exercise", "Resistance training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019586996", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57194286412": {"Name": "Cardinale D.A.", "AuthorID": "57194286412", "AffiliationID": "112846073", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Sports Confederation"}, "7401808764": {"Name": "Nilsson J.E.", "AuthorID": "7401808764", "AffiliationID": "60014437", "AffiliationName": "University of Dalarna"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}}}
