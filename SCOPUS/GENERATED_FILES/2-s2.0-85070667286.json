Design: Cross-sectional. Settings: Data were derived from two Norwegian population-based cohorts, the Young-HUNT1 (1995-1997) and Young-HUNT3 (2006-2008) from the county of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, Norway. Participants A total of 7268 adolescents (15-19 years) who had completed self-reported questionnaires including items on SI, DE, body size and weight perception were included. Primary outcome measures: ORs for SI given DE, body size or weight perception. Analyses were performed in multivariate logistic regression models. Results: The prevalence of SI was 23.1% in total population. Both girls and boys who reported DE, evaluated their body size as not 'about the same as others' or were 'unhappy about their weight' had between twofold to fivefold increase in odds for SI; these incremental risks were observed independent of sex, age, body mass index and socioeconomic status. We observed higher odds for SI among boys. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a clear association between SI and DE and its associated traits, in both genders but especially in males. Special attention should be paid on early detection of DE traits among adolescents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "body size perception", "EAT-12", "eating disorder (ED)", "HUNT", "intention to lose weight", "suicidal ideation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Body Image", "Body Mass Index", "Body Size", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Norway", "Prevalence", "Self Report", "Sex Factors", "Social Class", "Suicidal Ideation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070667286", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57210433799": {"Name": "Saeedzadeh Sardahaee F.", "AuthorID": "57210433799", "AffiliationID": "122989264", "AffiliationName": "Br\u00f8set Department, Regional Higher Security Psychiatry Department"}, "6604041204": {"Name": "Holmen T.L.", "AuthorID": "6604041204", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "HUNT Research Center, Department of Public Health and General Practice, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral and Brain Science Unit, University College London"}, "16508163800": {"Name": "Sund E.R.", "AuthorID": "16508163800", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and General Practice, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "8380132900": {"Name": "Bjerkeset O.", "AuthorID": "8380132900", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet"}, "6507099358": {"Name": "Kval\u00f8y K.", "AuthorID": "6507099358", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sami Health Research, Department of Community Medicine, UiT The Arctic University of Norway"}}}
