Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Purpose: The study investigated the outcome of a word-web intervention for children diagnosed with word-finding difficulties (WFDs). Method: Twenty children age 6\u20138 years with WFDs confirmed by a discrepancy between comprehension and production on the Test of Word Finding-2, were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 11) and waiting control (n = 9) groups. The intervention group had six sessions of intervention which used word-webs and targeted children\u2019s meta-cognitive awareness and word-retrieval. Result: On the treated experimental set (n = 25 items) the intervention group gained on average four times as many items as the waiting control group (d = 2.30). There were also gains on personally chosen items for the intervention group. There was little change on untreated items for either group. Conclusion: The study is the first randomised control trial to demonstrate an effect of word-finding therapy with children with language difficulties in mainstream school. The improvement in word-finding for treated items was obtained following a clinically realistic intervention in terms of approach, intensity and duration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intervention", "naming", "phonology", "semantics", "word-finding difficulties"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development Disorders", "Language Therapy", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026533324", "SubjectAreas": [["Research and Theory", "NURS", "2922"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["LPN and LVN", "NURS", "2912"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7006621998": {"Name": "Best W.", "AuthorID": "7006621998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55935638700": {"Name": "Hughes L.M.", "AuthorID": "55935638700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57195250250": {"Name": "Shobbrook K.", "AuthorID": "57195250250", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203520032": {"Name": "Thomas M.", "AuthorID": "57203520032", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College London"}, "36671092800": {"Name": "Fedor A.", "AuthorID": "36671092800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College London"}, "7004870911": {"Name": "Masterson J.", "AuthorID": "7004870911", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "18134608900": {"Name": "Roncoli S.", "AuthorID": "18134608900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "57195249985": {"Name": "Shepherd D.L.", "AuthorID": "57195249985", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "55345437400": {"Name": "Kapikian A.", "AuthorID": "55345437400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "56529738500": {"Name": "Fern-Pollak L.", "AuthorID": "56529738500", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Social Work and Human Sciences, University of West London"}, "35848524900": {"Name": "Howard D.", "AuthorID": "35848524900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School for Education, Communication & Language Sciences, Newcastle University"}}}
