In particular, we show that the matrix product state transfer matrix (MPS-TM) - a central object in the computation of static correlation functions - provides important information about the location and magnitude of the minima of the low-energy dispersion relation(s), and we present supporting numerical data for one-dimensional lattice and continuum models as well as two-dimensional lattice models on a cylinder. We elaborate on the peculiar structure of the MPS-TM's eigenspectrum and give several arguments for the close relation between the structure of the low-energy spectrum of the system and the form of the static correlation functions. Finally, we discuss how the MPS-TM connects to the exact quantum transfer matrix of the model at zero temperature. We present a renormalization group argument for obtaining finite bond dimension approximations of the MPS, which allows one to reinterpret variational MPS techniques (such as the density matrix renormalization group) as an application of Wilson's numerical renormalization group along the virtual (imaginary time) dimension of the system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dispersion relations", "renormalization group", "static correlations", "strongly correlated systems", "tensor network states", "transfer matrices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dispersion relations", "Network state", "Renormalization group", "static correlations", "Strongly correlated systems", "Transfer matrixes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929991799", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56658776000": {"Name": "Zauner V.", "AuthorID": "56658776000", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Center for Quantum Technology, University of Vienna"}, "57214970975": {"Name": "Rams M.M.", "AuthorID": "57214970975", "AffiliationID": "60013463", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Krak\u00f3w University of Technology"}, "56186338800": {"Name": "Verstraete F.", "AuthorID": "56186338800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}, "55792539400": {"Name": "Draxler D.", "AuthorID": "55792539400", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}, "55791710600": {"Name": "Vanderstraeten L.", "AuthorID": "55791710600", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}, "36611558200": {"Name": "Degroote M.", "AuthorID": "36611558200", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}, "36739040400": {"Name": "Haegeman J.", "AuthorID": "36739040400", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}, "12800207200": {"Name": "Stojevic V.", "AuthorID": "12800207200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57206230380": {"Name": "Schuch N.", "AuthorID": "57206230380", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Quanteninformation, RWTH Aachen University"}}}
