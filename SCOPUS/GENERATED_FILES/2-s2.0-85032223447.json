We investigated associations between circulating MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10 and TIMP-1, and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and pulse pressure (PP), as markers of arterial stiffness in type 1 diabetic patients. Methods: Individuals with type 1 diabetes from three different cohorts were included in this study: EURODIAB Prospective Complications study (n = 509), LEACE (n = 370) and PROFIL (n = 638). Linear regression analyses were used to investigate cross-sectional associations between circulating levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, and TIMP-1 and cfPWV (n = 614) as well as office PP (n = 1517). Data on 24-h brachial and 24-h central PP were available in 638 individuals from PROFIL. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and eGFR, and additionally for other cardiovascular risk factors and presence of vascular complications. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders and presence of vascular complications, circulating MMP-3 was associated with cfPWV [\u03b2 per 1 SD higher lnMMP3 0.29 m/s (0.02; 0.55)]. In addition, brachial and central 24-h PP measurements in PROFIL were significantly associated with MMP-2 [(1.40 (0.47:2.33) and 1.43 (0.63:2.23)]. Pooled data analysis showed significant associations of circulating levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 with office PP [\u03b2 per 1 SD higher lnMMP-1 and lnMMP-2 = - 0.83 mmHg (95% CI - 1.50; - 0.16) and = 1.33 mmHg (0.55; 2.10), respectively]. Conclusions: MMPs-1, -2, and -3 are independently associated with markers of arterial stiffening in patients with type 1 diabetes and may become therapeutic targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial stiffness", "Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity", "Matrix metalloproteinase", "Pulse pressure", "Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase", "Type 1 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 1", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 3", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032223447", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56562686300": {"Name": "Peeters S.A.", "AuthorID": "56562686300", "AffiliationID": "118882873", "AffiliationName": "Zuyderland hospital, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "35069141200": {"Name": "Engelen L.", "AuthorID": "35069141200", "AffiliationID": "60103556", "AffiliationName": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek"}, "7006504041": {"Name": "Schalkwijk C.G.", "AuthorID": "7006504041", "AffiliationID": "60070744, 60018869", "AffiliationName": "CARIM School for Cardiovascular Diseases, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "36051195700": {"Name": "Stehouwer C.D.A.", "AuthorID": "36051195700", "AffiliationID": "60070744, 60018869", "AffiliationName": "CARIM School for Cardiovascular Diseases, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "17134082000": {"Name": "Buijs J.", "AuthorID": "17134082000", "AffiliationID": "118882873", "AffiliationName": "Zuyderland hospital, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences"}, "7202037574": {"Name": "Fuller J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202037574", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "24168825800": {"Name": "Jorsal A.", "AuthorID": "24168825800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health"}, "7006204047": {"Name": "Tarnow L.", "AuthorID": "7006204047", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University, Faculty of Health"}, "36189059500": {"Name": "Theilade S.", "AuthorID": "36189059500", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen"}, "7005170096": {"Name": "Rossing P.", "AuthorID": "7005170096", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "University of Copenhagen"}, "35355625800": {"Name": "Parving H.H.", "AuthorID": "35355625800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Department of Medical Endocrinology"}}}
