However, evidence suggests that despite decades of experience, the effects of such interventions vary greatly and are not improving over time. Guidance on providing more effective feedback does exist, but it is distributed across a wide range of disciplines and theoretical perspectives. Through expert interviews; systematic reviews; and experience with providing, evaluating, and receiving practice feedback, 15 suggestions that are believed to be associated with effective feedback interventions have been identified. These suggestions are intended to provide practical guidance to quality improvement professionals, information technology developers, educators, administrators, and practitioners who receive such interventions. Designing interventions with these suggestions in mind should improve their effect, and studying the mechanisms underlying these suggestions will advance a stagnant literature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Comparative Effectiveness Research", "Formative Feedback", "Humans", "Practice Management, Medical", "Quality Improvement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960889080", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"6602742779": {"Name": "Brehaut J.C.", "AuthorID": "6602742779", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60085927", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Program, Centre for Practice Changing Research, Ottawa Hospital"}, "55192581900": {"Name": "Carroll K.", "AuthorID": "55192581900", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60085927", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Program, Centre for Practice Changing Research, Ottawa Hospital"}, "35730774700": {"Name": "Colquhoun H.L.", "AuthorID": "35730774700", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, University of Toronto, 160-500 University Avenue"}, "7003600473": {"Name": "Eva K.W.", "AuthorID": "7003600473", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Education Scholarship, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "7004717915": {"Name": "Sales A.", "AuthorID": "7004717915", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Medical School"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "18437196800": {"Name": "Ivers N.", "AuthorID": "18437196800", "AffiliationID": "60016900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Women's College Hospital"}, "34769948000": {"Name": "Grimshaw J.M.", "AuthorID": "34769948000", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60085927", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital, Centre for Practice Changing Research"}}}
