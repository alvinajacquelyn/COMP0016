Following the change of regime, the rate of foreign direct investment increased, modern industries emerged and exports became significant. However, this process was halted by the global economic crisis in many advanced and transition economies, and the concept of \u2018reindustrialization\u2019 emerged as one of the economic policy responses to the new challenges generated by the crisis. In our paper, we study whether reindustrialization is present following the lowest point of the crisis in one of the post-socialist countries of the EU, in Hungary. If so, in which regions and industries, and under what conditions? Our research indicates that reindustrialization can be generally observed only in a few rural regions after 2009, limited to only one or two industries, while, for instance, in the capital and in its agglomerations and in urban regions with large research universities, deindustrialization is more likely to take place.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hungary", "manufacturing", "Reindustrialization", "spatial differences", "transition economy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018160585", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7005599212": {"Name": "Lengyel I.", "AuthorID": "7005599212", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, University of Szeged"}, "35759770400": {"Name": "Vas Z.", "AuthorID": "35759770400", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, University of Szeged"}, "55558917800": {"Name": "Szakalne Kano I.", "AuthorID": "55558917800", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, University of Szeged"}, "26029913400": {"Name": "Lengyel B.", "AuthorID": "26029913400", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182611", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}}}
