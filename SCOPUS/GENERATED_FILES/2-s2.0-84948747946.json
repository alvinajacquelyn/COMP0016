The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We report on the analysis of the Chandra-ACIS data of O, B, and WR stars in the young association Cyg OB2. X-ray spectra of 49 O-stars, 54 B-stars, and 3 WR-stars are analyzed and for the brighter sources, the epoch dependence of the X-ray fluxes is investigated. The O-stars in Cyg OB2 follow a well-defined scaling relation between their X-ray and bolometric luminosities: . This relation is in excellent agreement with the one previously derived for the Carina OB1 association. Except for the brightest O-star binaries, there is no general X-ray overluminosity due to colliding winds in O-star binaries. Roughly half of the known B-stars in the surveyed field are detected, but they fail to display a clear relationship between LX and Lbol. Out of the three WR stars in Cyg OB2, probably only WR 144 is itself responsible for the observed level of X-ray emission, at a very low . The X-ray emission of the other two WR-stars (WR 145 and 146) is most probably due to their O-type companion along with a moderate contribution from a wind-wind interaction zone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Open clusters and associations: individual (Cyg OB2)", "stars: early-type", "stars: Wolf-Rayet", "X-rays: stars"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948747946", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7004661905": {"Name": "Rauw G.", "AuthorID": "7004661905", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'Astrophysique and G\u00e9ophysique, Universit\u00e9 de Liege"}, "6603806389": {"Name": "Naz\u00e9 Y.", "AuthorID": "6603806389", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'Astrophysique and G\u00e9ophysique, Universit\u00e9 de Liege"}, "8859075500": {"Name": "Wright N.", "AuthorID": "8859075500", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7201816814": {"Name": "Drake J.", "AuthorID": "7201816814", "AffiliationID": "60008668", "AffiliationName": "Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory"}, "15831623100": {"Name": "Guarcello M.", "AuthorID": "15831623100", "AffiliationID": "60008668", "AffiliationName": "Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory"}, "7003915827": {"Name": "Prinja R.", "AuthorID": "7003915827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54393907600": {"Name": "Peck L.", "AuthorID": "54393907600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6602277852": {"Name": "Albacete Colombo J.", "AuthorID": "6602277852", "AffiliationID": "60020298", "AffiliationName": "Centro Regional Zona Atl\u00e1ntica, Universidad Nacional Del Comahue"}, "56459658400": {"Name": "Herrero A.", "AuthorID": "56459658400", "AffiliationID": "60003044, 60011125", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, Universidad de la Laguna"}, "7003686030": {"Name": "Kobulnicky H.", "AuthorID": "7003686030", "AffiliationID": "60008827", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Wyoming"}, "7004455560": {"Name": "Sciortino S.", "AuthorID": "7004455560", "AffiliationID": "60073811", "AffiliationName": "INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo"}, "57205940294": {"Name": "Vink J.", "AuthorID": "57205940294", "AffiliationID": "60014022", "AffiliationName": "Armagh Observatory, College Hill"}}}
