A neighbourhood design is determined based on the selection from a pool of energy supply alternatives to meet the total annual energy demand. In addition to distributed generation units, energy integration in the form of microgrid (MG) operation and pipeline networks are considered. Location specific input data regarding cost, climate and regulations are taken into account. The effect of energy interaction restrictions, in the form of residential energy export and MG operation, on neighbourhood design is researched.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distributed energy system", "Energy integration", "Mixed integer linear programming", "Trigeneration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940551270", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55256780300": {"Name": "Wouters C.", "AuthorID": "55256780300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "24071142900": {"Name": "James A.", "AuthorID": "24071142900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
