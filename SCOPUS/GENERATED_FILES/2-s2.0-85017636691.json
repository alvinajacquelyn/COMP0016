The phagosome, the intracellular compartment where the killing and digestion of engulfed particles take place, is the main arena for neutrophil pathogen killing that requires tight regulation. Phagosomal pH is one aspect that is carefully controlled, in turn regulating antimicrobial protease activity. Many fluorescent pH-sensitive dyes have been used to visualize the phagosomal environment. S-1 has several advantages over other pH-sensitive dyes, including its dual emission spectra, its resistance to photo-bleaching, and its high pKa. Using this method, we have demonstrated that the neutrophil phagosome is unusually alkaline in comparison to other phagocytes. By using different biochemical conjugations of the dye, the phagosome can be delineated from the cytoplasm so that changes in the size and shape of the phagosome can be assessed. This allows for further monitoring of ionic movement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluorescence microscopy", "Immunology", "Innate immunity", "Issue 122", "Neutrophil", "Phagocytosis", "Phagosomal pH", "Ratiometric imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cytoplasm", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Neutrophils", "Phagocytes", "Phagosomes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017636691", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57193495148": {"Name": "Foote J.", "AuthorID": "57193495148", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "37063339800": {"Name": "Levine A.", "AuthorID": "37063339800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6603271708": {"Name": "Behe P.", "AuthorID": "6603271708", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7202309847": {"Name": "Segal A.", "AuthorID": "7202309847", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
