All rights reserved.We consider the deformation theory of asymptotically conical (AC) and of conically singular (CS) G2 manifolds. In the AC case, we show that if the rate of convergence \u03bd to the cone at infinity is generic in a precise sense and lies in the interval (\u22124, 0), then the moduli space is smooth and we compute its dimension in terms of topological and analytic data. For generic rates \u03bd < \u22124 in the AC case, and for generic positive rates of convergence to the cones at the singular points in the CS case, the deformation theory is in general obstructed. We describe the obstruction spaces explicitly in terms of the spectrum of the Laplacian on the link of the cones on the ends, and compute the virtual dimension of the moduli space. We also present many applications of these results, including: the uniqueness of the Bryant\u2013Salamon AC G2 manifolds via local rigidity and the cohomogeneity one property of AC G2 manifolds asymptotic to homogeneous cones; the smoothness of the CS moduli space if the singularities are modeled on particular G2 cones; and the proof of existence of a \u201cgood gauge\u201d needed for desingularization of CS G2 manifolds. Finally, we discuss some open problems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095262676", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"8852424800": {"Name": "Karigiannis S.", "AuthorID": "8852424800", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo Waterloo"}, "20734663500": {"Name": "Lotay J.D.", "AuthorID": "20734663500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
