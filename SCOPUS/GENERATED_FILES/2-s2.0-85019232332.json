Hence the solution is nonnegative for nonnegative initial data. Following earlier work on the heat equation, our purpose is to study whether this property is inherited by certain spatially semidiscrete and fully discrete piecewise linear finite element methods, including the standard Galerkin method, the lumped mass method and the finite volume element method. It is shown that, as for the heat equation, when the mass matrix is nondiagonal, nonnegativity is not preserved for small time or time-step, but may reappear after a positivity threshold. For the lumped mass method nonnegativity is preserved if and only if the triangulation in the finite element space is of Delaunay type. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the theoretical results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caputo fractional derivative", "Finite element method", "Nonnegativity preservation", "Subdiffusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019232332", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003806023": {"Name": "Lazarov R.", "AuthorID": "7003806023", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}, "6701518311": {"Name": "Thom\u00e9e V.", "AuthorID": "6701518311", "AffiliationID": "60000990, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, University of Gothenburg"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University"}}}
