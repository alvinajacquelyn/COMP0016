All rights reserved.The syndrome of visuospatial neglect is a common consequence of unilateral brain injury. It is most often associated with stroke and is more severe and persistent following right hemisphere damage, with reported frequencies in the acute stage of up to 80%. Neglect is primarily a disorder of attention whereby patients characteristically fail to orientate, to report or to respond to stimuli located on the contralesional side. Neglect is usually caused by large strokes in the middle cerebral artery territory and is heterogeneous, such that most patients do not manifest every feature of the syndrome. A number of treatments may improve neglect, but there is no widely accepted universal approach to therapy. Although most patients recover spontaneously, the evidence suggests that they continue to have significant cognitive impairments, particularly relating to attention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Male", "Perceptual Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941556882", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55386789800": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55386789800", "AffiliationID": "60159688", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Coventry"}, "8086798900": {"Name": "Malhotra P.A.", "AuthorID": "8086798900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Restorative Neuroscience, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}}}
