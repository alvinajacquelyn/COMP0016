We have developed a versatile, tissue-specific binary in vivo biotinylation system in zebrafish termed biotagging that uses genetically encoded components to biotinylate target proteins, enabling in-depth genome-wide analyses of their molecular interactions. Using tissue-specific drivers and cell-compartment-specific effector lines, we demonstrate the specificity of the biotagging toolkit at the biochemical, cellular, and transcriptional levels. We use biotagging to characterize the in vivo transcriptional landscape of migratory neural crest and myocardial cells in different cellular compartments (ribosomes and nucleus). These analyses reveal a comprehensive network of coding and non-coding RNAs and cis-regulatory modules, demonstrating that tissue-specific identity is embedded in the nuclear transcriptomes. By eliminating background inherent to complex embryonic environments, biotagging allows analyses of molecular interactions at high resolution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bi-directional transcription", "cis-regulation", "enhancers", "in vivo biotinylation", "myocardium", "neural crest", "nuclear transcriptome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Compartmentation", "Cell Lineage", "Conserved Sequence", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Neural Crest", "Organ Specificity", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017304199", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35495555900": {"Name": "Trinh L.A.", "AuthorID": "35495555900", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Computational Biology, University of Southern California"}, "7201735128": {"Name": "Fraser S.E.", "AuthorID": "7201735128", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Computational Biology, University of Southern California"}, "57193878964": {"Name": "Chong-Morrison V.", "AuthorID": "57193878964", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "36600415400": {"Name": "Gavriouchkina D.", "AuthorID": "36600415400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "55538197500": {"Name": "Hochgreb-H\u00e4gele T.", "AuthorID": "55538197500", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "57142307300": {"Name": "Senanayake U.", "AuthorID": "57142307300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6506693180": {"Name": "Sauka-Spengler T.", "AuthorID": "6506693180", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
