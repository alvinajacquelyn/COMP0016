In stage 1 of the trial patients with treated primary colorectal cancer metastatic to the lungs are invited to consent for protocol-based evaluation of their suitability for metastasectomy. The evaluation is as in current practice and includes PET/CT. A decision for or against metastasectomy may be based on the opinion of the clinicians and the preference of the patient. If there is uncertainty the patient is invited to consent to have the treatment arm assigned by randomization in stage 2 of PulMiCC. More than 300 patients have entered stage 1 and more than 70 are in stage 2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colorectal cancer", "lung metastasectomy", "randomized trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Metastasectomy", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Survival Rate", "Thoracic Surgical Procedures", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922642689", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57201656703": {"Name": "Migliore M.", "AuthorID": "57201656703", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Catania"}, "56003262200": {"Name": "Milo\u0161evi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "56003262200", "AffiliationID": "60068801", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Thoracic Surgery, Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, University of Novi Sad"}, "7005472350": {"Name": "Lees B.", "AuthorID": "7005472350", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College"}, "56513502400": {"Name": "Maria G.D.", "AuthorID": "56513502400", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Pneumology Unit, Department of Clinical and Molecular Bio-Medicine, University of Catania"}}}
