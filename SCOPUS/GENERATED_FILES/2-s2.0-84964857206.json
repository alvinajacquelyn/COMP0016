It is known that the travel time distances for all interior points determine the Riemannian manifold in a stable manner. We do not assume that there are sources or receivers in the interior, and use the hyperbolic Neumann-to-Dirichlet map, or its restriction, as our data. Our algorithm is a variant of the boundary control method, and to our knowledge, this is therst numerical implementation of the method in a geometric setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary control method", "Travel time distances", "Wave equation"], "IndexKeywords": ["A-stable", "Boundary control methods", "Dirichlet", "Interior point", "Neumann", "Numerical implementation", "Riemannian manifold"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964857206", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004025757": {"Name": "De Hoop M.V.", "AuthorID": "7004025757", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics and Earth Science, Rice University"}, "57189039967": {"Name": "Kepley P.", "AuthorID": "57189039967", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Purdue University"}, "36241865400": {"Name": "Oksanen L.", "AuthorID": "36241865400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
