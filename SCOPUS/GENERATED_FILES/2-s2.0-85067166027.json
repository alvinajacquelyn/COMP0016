All rights reserved.To put the notion of personal identity in the forefront of an understanding of teachers implies a need to examine theories of both adult and professional change, and the links that have been made between them.

One possible way to unravel the relationship between professional and personal development is to examine what influence the individual's 'substantial' self has upon his/her career development. Finally, a number of the longest-serving teachers, assured by their job-satisfaction and proven competence of the match between self and occupation, turned for further self-development to impact concerns; in particular they sought for hierarchical positions which would enable them to influence and spread their ideas to others.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067166027", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"24380088300": {"Name": "Nias J.", "AuthorID": "24380088300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
