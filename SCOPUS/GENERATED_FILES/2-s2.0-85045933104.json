Method: An international summit on intellectual disability and dementia held in Glasgow, Scotland in 2016 identified how PDS applies to adults with an intellectual disability and dementia. The Summit proposed a model that encompassed seven focal areas: post-diagnostic counseling; psychological and medical surveillance; periodic reviews and adjustments to the dementia care plan; early identification of behaviour and psychological symptoms; reviews of care practices and supports for advanced dementia and end of life; supports to carers/ support staff; and evaluation of quality of life. It also explored current practices in providing PDS in intellectual disability services. Results: The Summit concluded that although there is limited research evidence for pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for people with intellectual disability and dementia, viable resources and guidelines describe practical approaches drawn from clinical practice. Post diagnostic support is essential, and the model components in place for the general population, and proposed here for use within the intellectual disability field, need to be individualized and adapted to the person's needs as dementia progresses. Conclusions: Recommendations for future research include examining the prevalence and nature of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) in adults with an intellectual disability who develop dementia, the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological interventions, the interaction between pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and the utility of different models of support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consensus statement", "Dementia", "intellectual disability", "non-pharmacological interventions", "post-diagnostic support"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Congresses as Topic", "Consensus", "Dementia", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Patient Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045933104", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36349697100": {"Name": "Dodd K.", "AuthorID": "36349697100", "AffiliationID": "60170280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8057930500": {"Name": "Watchman K.", "AuthorID": "8057930500", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "University of Stirling"}, "7006177384": {"Name": "Janicki M.P.", "AuthorID": "7006177384", "AffiliationID": "60027561", "AffiliationName": "University of Illinois at Chicago"}, "6506026305": {"Name": "Coppus A.", "AuthorID": "6506026305", "AffiliationID": "101577808", "AffiliationName": "Dichterbij Centre of the Intellectual Disabled"}, "57205669455": {"Name": "Gaertner C.", "AuthorID": "57205669455", "AffiliationID": "100686114", "AffiliationName": "Theodor Fliedner Foundation"}, "36171423000": {"Name": "Fortea J.", "AuthorID": "36171423000", "AffiliationID": "117493388", "AffiliationName": "Down Medical Center, Fundaci\u00f3 Catalana S\u00edndrome de Down"}, "12768350000": {"Name": "Santos F.H.", "AuthorID": "12768350000", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "UNESP - S\u00e3o Paulo State University"}, "55654180200": {"Name": "Keller S.M.", "AuthorID": "55654180200", "AffiliationID": "115386031", "AffiliationName": "Advocare Neurology South Jersey"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
