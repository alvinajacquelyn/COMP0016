However, knowledge regarding age-related changes of motor network interactions between brain regions remains scarce. We here investigated the impact of ageing on the interaction of cortical areas during movement selection and initiation using dynamic causal modelling (DCM). We found that age-related psychomotor slowing was accompanied by increases in both regional activity and effective connectivity, especially for \u2018core\u2019 motor coupling targeting primary motor cortex (M1). Interestingly, younger participants within the older group showed strongest connectivity targeting M1, which steadily decreased with advancing age. Conversely, prefrontal influences on the motor system increased with advancing age, and were inversely correlated with reduced parietal influences and core motor coupling. Interestingly, higher net coupling within the prefrontal-premotor-M1 axis predicted faster psychomotor speed in ageing. Hence, as opposed to a uniform age-related decline, our findings are compatible with the idea of different age-related compensatory mechanisms, with an important role of the prefrontal cortex compensating for reduced coupling within the core motor network.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Effective connectivity", "fMRI", "Motor control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affect", "Aged", "Aging", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Pathways", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Oxygen", "Psychomotor Performance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042191035", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55314338300": {"Name": "Michely J.", "AuthorID": "55314338300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "55598427000": {"Name": "Volz L.", "AuthorID": "55598427000", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and UCSB Brain Imaging Center, University of California"}, "7202767717": {"Name": "Fink G.", "AuthorID": "7202767717", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1, INM-3), Research Centre J\u00fclich"}, "6602258560": {"Name": "Grefkes C.", "AuthorID": "6602258560", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1, INM-3), Research Centre J\u00fclich"}, "54787726500": {"Name": "Hoffstaedter F.", "AuthorID": "54787726500", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "9742676000": {"Name": "Eickhoff S.", "AuthorID": "9742676000", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "57201345932": {"Name": "Tittgemeyer M.", "AuthorID": "57201345932", "AffiliationID": "60023626", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research"}}}
