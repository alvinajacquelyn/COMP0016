This is a delicate procedure relying on small instrumentation with limited articulation to guide the laser tip and a narrow field of view to visualize all relevant vascular connections. In this letter, we report on a mechatronic design for a comanipulated instrument that combines concentric tube actuation to a larger manipulator constrained by a remote centre of motion. A stereoscopic camera is mounted at the distal tip and used for imaging. Our mechanism provides enhanced dexterity and stability of the imaging device. We demonstrate that the imaging system can be used for computing geometry and enhancing the view at the operating site. Results using electromagnetic sensors for verification and comparison to visual odometry from the distal sensor show that our system is promising and can be developed further for multiple clinical needs in fetoscopic procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Surgical robotics: Laparoscopy medical robots and systems flexible robots mechanism design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuum robot", "Control interfaces", "Electromagnetic sensors", "Interventional treatment", "Mechatronic design", "Medical robots and systems", "Remote centre of motions", "Stereoscopic camera"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041901713", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"56742945400": {"Name": "Dwyer G.", "AuthorID": "56742945400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Robot Vision Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55367064500": {"Name": "Chadebecq F.", "AuthorID": "55367064500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Robot Vision Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Robot Vision Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57207943727": {"Name": "Amo M.T.", "AuthorID": "57207943727", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56038489100": {"Name": "Maneas E.", "AuthorID": "56038489100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "13607280000": {"Name": "Pawar V.", "AuthorID": "13607280000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "TouchLab, University College London"}, "16550938100": {"Name": "Poorten E.V.", "AuthorID": "16550938100", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"}, "55981137300": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "55981137300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College London"}, "24801882300": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "24801882300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
