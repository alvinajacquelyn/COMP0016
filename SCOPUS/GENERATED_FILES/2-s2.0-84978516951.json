Significantly, the resulting depth of the vacuum cavity of the sensor is determined by the thickness of the silicon substrate at which Si is removed by the anisotropic wet etching process. Compared with the sensor based on a sacrificial layer technique, the proposed MEMS thermal shear-stress sensor exhibits dramatically improved sensitivity due to the much larger vacuum cavity depth. The fabricated MEMS thermal shear-stress sensor with a vacuum cavity depth as large as 525 \u03bcm and a vacuum of 5 \u00d7 10-2 Pa exhibits a sensitivity of 184.5 mV/Pa and a response time of 180 \u03bcs. We also experimentally demonstrate that the sensor power is indeed proportional to the 1/3-power of the applied shear stress. The substrate-free structures offer the ability to precisely measure the shear stress fluctuations in low speed turbulent boundary layer wind tunnels.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic wet etching", "Anodic bonding technology", "Micro electromechanical system (MEMS)", "Sacrificial layer", "Shear-stress fluctuations", "Silicon substrates", "Thermal shear-stress sensor", "Turbulent boundary layers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978516951", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55567148500": {"Name": "Ou Y.", "AuthorID": "55567148500", "AffiliationID": "60027799, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55567175600": {"Name": "Qu F.", "AuthorID": "55567175600", "AffiliationID": "60027799, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56283348000": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "56283348000", "AffiliationID": "60027799, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57219601903": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57219601903", "AffiliationID": "60027799, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7007123682": {"Name": "Ou W.", "AuthorID": "7007123682", "AffiliationID": "60027799, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8682656800": {"Name": "Xie C.", "AuthorID": "8682656800", "AffiliationID": "60027799, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "53880326000": {"Name": "Nie M.", "AuthorID": "53880326000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton (N CATS), Engineering Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
