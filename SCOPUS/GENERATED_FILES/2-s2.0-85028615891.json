System performance of dual-polarization modulation formats, such as DP-QPSK, DP-16QAM, and DP-64QAM, is investigated using both the analytical model and numerical simulations. A good agreement between analytical and numerical results shows that, in the case of full-field nonlinearity compensation, accounting for second-order interactions becomes essential to predict system performance of both single- and multi-channel systems at optimum launched powers and beyond. This effect is validated via numerical simulations for signal bandwidths up to ~1 THz.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dual-polarizations", "Multichannel system", "Non-linearity compensation", "Nonlinear effect", "Numerical results", "Second orders", "Second-order interaction", "Signal bandwidth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028615891", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57090027300": {"Name": "Shevchenko N.", "AuthorID": "57090027300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "56114715000": {"Name": "Liga G.", "AuthorID": "56114715000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "16028461400": {"Name": "Ives D.", "AuthorID": "16028461400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge"}}}
