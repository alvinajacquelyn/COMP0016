The system uses a wireless-enabled wearable device and smartphone to collect longitudinal accelerometry, heart-rate, ambient light and smartphone usage patterns from patients living in their homes. These data are encrypted and sent via the mobile data network to a secure server for real-Time analysis, using the Purple Robot mobile application. This study tested feasibility and acceptability of the SleepSight system in 15 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Patient recruitment and data collection was completed in January 2016, at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), the largest mental health service provider in the EU. The project is a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, and the National Health Service.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mental Disorder", "Mobile Sensing", "Probabilistic Time Series Modelling", "Remote Monitoring", "Sensor Networks", "Wearable Computing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Mental disorders", "Mobile sensing", "Remote monitoring", "Time-series modelling", "Wearable computing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991096071", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"56989675400": {"Name": "Kerz M.", "AuthorID": "56989675400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "35766461900": {"Name": "Folarin A.", "AuthorID": "35766461900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "56281139600": {"Name": "Meyer N.", "AuthorID": "56281139600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "7003607616": {"Name": "MacCabe J.", "AuthorID": "7003607616", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "36766824700": {"Name": "Begale M.", "AuthorID": "36766824700", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}}}
