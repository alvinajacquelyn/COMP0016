This review of studies conducted to test the validity and implications of the diagnostic proposals generally supports the proposed 3-factor structure of PTSD symptoms, the 6-factor structure of Complex PTSD symptoms, and the distinction between PTSD and Complex PTSD. Estimates derived from DSM-based items suggest the likely prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD in adults is lower than ICD-10 PTSD and lower than DSM-IV or DSM-5 PTSD, but this may change with the development of items that directly measure the ICD-11 re-experiencing requirement. Preliminary evidence suggests the prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD in community samples of children and adolescents is similar to DSM-IV and DSM-5. ICD-11 PTSD detects some individuals with significant impairment who would not receive a diagnosis under DSM-IV or DSM-5. ICD-11 CPTSD identifies a distinct group who have more often experienced multiple and sustained traumas and have greater functional impairment than those with PTSD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "International Classification of Diseases", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030856860", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "35420810100": {"Name": "Cloitre M.", "AuthorID": "35420810100", "AffiliationID": "100484897", "AffiliationName": "Division of Dissemination and Training, National Center for PTSD"}, "55113504900": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "55113504900", "AffiliationID": "60104048", "AffiliationName": "School of Business, National College of Ireland"}, "7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Ulster"}, "56059359000": {"Name": "Maercker A.", "AuthorID": "56059359000", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Division of Psychopathology, University of Zurich"}, "7402594156": {"Name": "Bryant R.A.", "AuthorID": "7402594156", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "47461231200": {"Name": "Humayun A.", "AuthorID": "47461231200", "AffiliationID": "119577721", "AffiliationName": "Meditrina Healthcare"}, "7403623194": {"Name": "Jones L.M.", "AuthorID": "7403623194", "AffiliationID": "60032499, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "FXB Center for Health and Human Rights, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard University"}, "6602679848": {"Name": "Kagee A.", "AuthorID": "6602679848", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "35612387600": {"Name": "Rousseau C.", "AuthorID": "35612387600", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, McGill University Health Center"}, "6701404117": {"Name": "Somasundaram D.", "AuthorID": "6701404117", "AffiliationID": "60071103", "AffiliationName": "University of Jaffna"}, "55270760400": {"Name": "Suzuki Y.", "AuthorID": "55270760400", "AffiliationID": "60017451", "AffiliationName": "National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "7102849907": {"Name": "Wessely S.", "AuthorID": "7102849907", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7004714180": {"Name": "van Ommeren M.", "AuthorID": "7004714180", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, World Health Organization"}, "7201360998": {"Name": "Reed G.M.", "AuthorID": "7201360998", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Global Mental Health Program, Columbia University Medical Center"}}}
