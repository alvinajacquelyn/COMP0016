The scarce availability of multi-speaker articulatory data makes it difficult to learn a mapping which generalizes from a limited number of training speakers and reliably reconstructs the articulatory movements of unseen speakers. In this paper, we propose a Multi-task Learning (MTL)-based approach that explicitly separates the modeling of each training speaker AI peculiarities from the modeling of AI characteristics that are shared by all speakers. Our approach stems from the well known Regularized MTL approach and extends it to feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs). Given multiple training speakers, we learn for each an acoustic-to-articulatory mapping represented by a DNN. Then, through an iterative procedure, we search for a canonical speaker-independent DNN that is \"similar\" to all speaker-dependent DNNs. The degree of similarity is controlled by a regularization parameter. We report experiments on the University of Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Database under different training/testing experimental settings. The results obtained indicate that our MTL-trained canonical DNN largely outperforms a standardly trained (i.e., single task learning-based) speaker independent DNN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic inversion", "Acoustic-to-articulatory mapping", "Multi-task learning", "XRMB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic-to-articulatory mapping", "Degree of similarity", "Multitask learning", "Regularization parameters", "Single task learning", "Speaker independents", "University of Wisconsin", "XRMB"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039150413", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"34881512600": {"Name": "Badino L.", "AuthorID": "34881512600", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "57200081491": {"Name": "Franceschi L.", "AuthorID": "57200081491", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55977393100": {"Name": "Donini M.", "AuthorID": "55977393100", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "6603887035": {"Name": "Pontil M.", "AuthorID": "6603887035", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35092083100": {"Name": "Arora R.", "AuthorID": "35092083100", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University"}}}
