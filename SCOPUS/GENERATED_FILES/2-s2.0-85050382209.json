Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn this invited feature article, the invention of pressurized gyration in 2013 and its subsequent development into sister processes such as pressurized melt gyration, infusion gyration, and pressure-coupled infusion gyration is elucidated. The fundamentals of these processes are discussed, elucidating how these novel methods can be used to facilitate mass production of polymeric fibers and other morphologies. The effects of the main system parameters: rotational speed and gas pressure, are discussed along with the influence of solution parameters such as viscosity and polymer chain entanglement. The effect of flow of material into the gyrator in infused gyration is also illustrated. Examples of many polymers that have been subjected to these processes are discussed and the applications of resulting products are illustrated under several different research themes such as, tissue engineering, drug delivery, diagnostics, hydrogels, filtration, and wound healing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomedical", "fibers", "functional", "polymers", "pressurized gyration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical", "Flow of material", "Functional", "Mass production", "Polymeric fibers", "Pressurized gyration", "Rotational speed", "Solution parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050382209", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57198860979": {"Name": "Heseltine P.", "AuthorID": "57198860979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57200420958": {"Name": "Ahmed J.", "AuthorID": "57200420958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
