However, only 25% of selected patients test positive for BRCA1/2 mutation, indicating that additional diagnostic biomarkers are necessary. We analyzed 124 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from patients with hereditary (104) and sporadic (20) invasive breast cancer, divided into two series (A and B). Microarray expression profiling of 829 human miRNAs was performed on 76 samples (Series A), and bioinformatics tool Prophet was used to develop and test a microarray classifier. Samples were stratified into a training set (n=538) for microarray classifier generation and a test set (n=538) for signature validation. A 35-miRNA microarray classifier was generated for the prediction of BRCA1/2 mutation status with a reported 95% (95% CI=0.88-1.0) and 92% (95% CI: 0.84-1.0) accuracy in the training and the test set, respectively. Differential expression of 12 miRNAs between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers versus noncarriers was validated by qPCR in an independent tumor series B (n548). Logistic regression model based on the expression of six miRNAs (miR-142-3p, miR-505\u2217, miR-1248, miR-181a-2\u2217, miR-25\u2217 and miR-340\u2217) discriminated between tumors from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and noncarriers with 92% (95% CI: 0.84-0.99) accuracy. In conclusion, we identified miRNA expression signatures predictive of BRCA1/2 mutation status in routinely available FFPE breast tumor samples, which may be useful to complement current patient selection criteria for gene testing by identifying individuals with high likelihood of being BRCA1/2 mutation carriers", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRCA1", "BRCA2", "Diagnostic biomarker", "Hereditary breast cancer", "MiRNA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Female", "Formaldehyde", "Genes, BRCA1", "Genes, BRCA2", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "MicroRNAs", "Mutation", "Paraffin Embedding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911002355", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"54584546700": {"Name": "Tanic M.", "AuthorID": "54584546700", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Human Genetics Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "56215775600": {"Name": "Yanowski K.", "AuthorID": "56215775600", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Human Genetics Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "7006178585": {"Name": "Osorio A.", "AuthorID": "7006178585", "AffiliationID": "60085100", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER)"}, "6701384111": {"Name": "Martinez-Delgado B.", "AuthorID": "6701384111", "AffiliationID": "60085100", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER)"}, "7203010415": {"Name": "Ben\u00edtez J.", "AuthorID": "7203010415", "AffiliationID": "60085100", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER)"}, "24279428700": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez G.", "AuthorID": "24279428700", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "24588110800": {"Name": "Pisano D.G.", "AuthorID": "24588110800", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "57210008838": {"Name": "Socorro Rodriguez-Pinilla M.", "AuthorID": "57210008838", "AffiliationID": "60019290", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Department, Fundaci\u00f3n Jimenez D\u00edaz"}, "6506589786": {"Name": "Marquez-Rodas I.", "AuthorID": "6506589786", "AffiliationID": "60108393, 60033237", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Oncolog\u00eda M\u00e9dica, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n"}}}
