All rights reserved.Small-scale (micro-/nanoscale) heat transfer has broad and exciting range of applications. Heat transfer at small scale quite naturally is influenced - sometimes dramatically - with high surface area-to-volume ratios. This in effect means that heat transfer in small-scale devices and systems is influenced by surface treatment and surface morphology. Importantly, interfacial dynamic effects are at least non-negligible, and there is a strong potential to engineer the performance of such devices using the progress in micro- and nanomanufacturing technologies. With this motivation, the emphasis here is on heat conduction and convection. The chapter starts with a broad introduction to Boltzmann transport equation which captures the physics of small-scale heat transport, while also outlining the differences between small-scale transport and classical macroscale heat transport. Among applications, examples are thermoelectric and thermal interface materials where micro- and nanofabrication have led to impressive figure of merits and thermal management performance. Basic of phonon transport and its manipulation through nanostructuring materials are discussed in detail. Small-scale single-phase convection and the crucial role it has played in developing the thermal management solutions for the next generation of electronics and energy-harvesting devices are discussed as the next topic. Features of microcooling platforms and physics of optimized thermal transport using microchannel manifold heat sinks are discussed in detail along with a discussion of how such systems also facilitate use of low-grade, waste heat from data centers and photovoltaic modules. Phase change process and their control using surface micro-/nanostructure are discussed next. Among the feature considered, the first are microscale heat pipes where capillary effects play an important role. Next the role of nanostructures in controlling nucleation and mobility of the discrete phase in two-phase processes, such as boiling, condensation, and icing is explained in great detail. Special emphasis is placed on the limitations of current surface and device manufacture technologies while also outlining the potential ways to overcome them. Lastly, the chapter is concluded with a summary and perspective on future trends and, more importantly, the opportunities for new research and applications in this exciting field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Boltzmann transport equation", "Conduction and convections", "Energy harvesting device", "Manufacture technology", "Nano-manufacturing technology", "Research and application", "Single-phase convections", "Thermal interface materials"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063119073", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"55998964200": {"Name": "Maitra T.", "AuthorID": "55998964200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57207873753": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57207873753", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "35323167300": {"Name": "Tiwari M.K.", "AuthorID": "35323167300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
