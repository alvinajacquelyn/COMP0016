Here, we sought to identify genetic factors contributing to levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in white and Chinese populations. Gd-IgA1 levels were elevated in IgAN patients compared with ethnically matched healthy subjects and correlated with evidence of disease progression. White patients with IgAN exhibited significantly higher Gd-IgA1 levels than did Chinese patients. Among individuals without IgAN, Gd-IgA1 levels did not correlate with kidney function. Gd-IgA1 level heritability (h2), estimated by comparing midparental and offspring Gd-IgA1 levels, was 0.39. Genome-wide association analysis by linear regression identified alleles at a single locus spanning the C1GALT1 gene that strongly associated with Gd-IgA1 level (b=0.26; P=2.35\u00d710-9). This association was replicated in a genome-wide association study of separate cohorts comprising 308 patients with membranous GN from the UK (P<1.00\u00d710-6) and 622 controls with normal kidney function from the UK (P<1.00\u00d710-10), and in a candidate gene study of 704 Chinese patients with IgAN (P<1.00\u00d710-5). The same extended haplotype associated with elevated Gd-IgA1 levels in all cohorts studied. C1GALT1 encodes a galactosyltransferase enzyme that is important inO-galactosylation of glycoproteins. These findings demonstrate that common variation at C1GALT1 influencesGd-IgA1 level in the population, which independently associates with risk of progressive IgAN, and that the pathogenic importance of changes in IgA1 O-glycosylation may vary between white and Chinese patients with IgAN.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Galactose", "Galactosyltransferases", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Glomerulonephritis, IGA", "Glycosylation", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin A", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021741374", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"22634019700": {"Name": "Gale D.P.", "AuthorID": "22634019700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57203209150": {"Name": "Caplin B.", "AuthorID": "57203209150", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57194698847": {"Name": "Ferlin A.", "AuthorID": "57194698847", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "26537993300": {"Name": "Stanescu H.", "AuthorID": "26537993300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57207559231": {"Name": "Kleta R.", "AuthorID": "57207559231", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "37063339800": {"Name": "Levine A.P.", "AuthorID": "37063339800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6506396198": {"Name": "Molyneux K.", "AuthorID": "6506396198", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}, "57194703381": {"Name": "Wimbury D.", "AuthorID": "57194703381", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}, "57194700038": {"Name": "Higgins P.", "AuthorID": "57194700038", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}, "15130838200": {"Name": "Barratt J.", "AuthorID": "15130838200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}, "56415820300": {"Name": "Yin P.", "AuthorID": "56415820300", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55575709300": {"Name": "Yu X.", "AuthorID": "55575709300", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57199851850": {"Name": "Nelson C.P.", "AuthorID": "57199851850", "AffiliationID": "60033125, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, National Institute for Health Research Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "7004345054": {"Name": "Samani N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004345054", "AffiliationID": "60033125, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, National Institute for Health Research Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}}}
