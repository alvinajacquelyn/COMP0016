At-risk poor word readers (n = 201) were allocated to either (a) Direct Mapping and Set-for-Variability (DMSfV) or (b) Current or Best-Practices small-group reading programs, typically for 10\u201311 hr over 10 weeks. Students were matched on baseline reading and language abilities, parent demographic measures, and observed regular classroom teaching quality. Results of hierarchical data modeling showed advantages for the DMSfV program (p <.05 for word reading and spelling at posttest and word reading and sentence comprehension at 5-month delayed posttest), with discernible valued added for the DMSfV condition across all follow-up measures. Results support the use of small-group preventative literacy intervention models that teach both direct mapping of grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondences in text and set-for-variability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041201432", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"7102776376": {"Name": "Savage R.", "AuthorID": "7102776376", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University"}, "57200422554": {"Name": "Maiorino K.", "AuthorID": "57200422554", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University"}, "13409273100": {"Name": "Georgiou G.", "AuthorID": "13409273100", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}, "6602303372": {"Name": "Parrila R.", "AuthorID": "6602303372", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}}}
