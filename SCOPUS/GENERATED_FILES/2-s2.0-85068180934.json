Patients and Methods: Post-digital rectal examination urine-derived EV-RNA expression profiles (n = 535, multiple centres) were interrogated with a curated NanoString panel. A LASSO-based continuation ratio model was built to generate four prostate urine risk (PUR) signatures for predicting the probability of normal tissue (PUR-1), D'Amico low-risk (PUR-2), intermediate-risk (PUR-3), and high-risk (PUR-4) prostate cancer. This model was applied to a test cohort (n = 177) for diagnostic evaluation, and to an AS sub-cohort (n = 87) for prognostic evaluation. Results: Each PUR signature was significantly associated with its corresponding clinical category (P < 0.001). PUR-4 status predicted the presence of clinically significant intermediate- or high-risk disease (area under the curve = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70\u20130.84). Application of PUR provided a net benefit over current clinical practice. In an AS sub-cohort (n = 87), groups defined by PUR status and proportion of PUR-4 had a significant association with time to progression (interquartile range hazard ratio [HR] 2.86, 95% CI 1.83\u20134.47; P < 0.001). PUR-4, when used continuously, dichotomized patient groups with differential progression rates of 10% and 60% 5 years after urine collection (HR 8.23, 95% CI 3.26\u201320.81; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Urine-derived EV-RNA can provide diagnostic information on aggressive prostate cancer prior to biopsy, and prognostic information for men on AS. PUR represents a new and versatile biomarker that could result in substantial alterations to current treatment of patients with prostate cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["#PCSM", "#ProstateCancer", "active surveillance", "biomarker", "cell free", "liquid biopsy", "urine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068180934", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57188634935": {"Name": "Connell S.P.", "AuthorID": "57188634935", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "36999550300": {"Name": "Yazbek-Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "36999550300", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "7202413474": {"Name": "Hurst R.", "AuthorID": "7202413474", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57209567627": {"Name": "Webb M.", "AuthorID": "57209567627", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57218874566": {"Name": "Curley H.", "AuthorID": "57218874566", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57211975356": {"Name": "Brewer D.S.", "AuthorID": "57211975356", "AffiliationID": "60105122", "AffiliationName": "Earlham Institute"}, "7403318830": {"Name": "Cooper C.S.", "AuthorID": "7403318830", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "7407826776": {"Name": "Clark J.", "AuthorID": "7407826776", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "35183642100": {"Name": "McCarthy F.", "AuthorID": "35183642100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7005954855": {"Name": "Dennis N.", "AuthorID": "7005954855", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55387124200": {"Name": "Stuttle C.", "AuthorID": "55387124200", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57209566913": {"Name": "Walker H.", "AuthorID": "57209566913", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403036808": {"Name": "Mills R.", "AuthorID": "7403036808", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402426139": {"Name": "Ball R.Y.", "AuthorID": "7402426139", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7007150107": {"Name": "Sanda M.G.", "AuthorID": "7007150107", "AffiliationID": "60002339, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "55280295800": {"Name": "Pellegrini K.L.", "AuthorID": "55280295800", "AffiliationID": "60002339, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "56537868900": {"Name": "Patil D.", "AuthorID": "56537868900", "AffiliationID": "60002339, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "8102556100": {"Name": "Perry A.S.", "AuthorID": "8102556100", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology and Environmental Science, Science West, University College Dublin"}, "7101847178": {"Name": "Schalken J.", "AuthorID": "7101847178", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Nijmegen Medical Centre, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "7003309232": {"Name": "Pandha H.", "AuthorID": "7003309232", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, The University of Surrey"}, "57211975112": {"Name": "Whitaker H.", "AuthorID": "57211975112", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics Group, University College London"}, "7101996312": {"Name": "Mills I.G.", "AuthorID": "7101996312", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "6503983799": {"Name": "Guldvik I.", "AuthorID": "6503983799", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "57202591312": {"Name": "Parker C.", "AuthorID": "57202591312", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
