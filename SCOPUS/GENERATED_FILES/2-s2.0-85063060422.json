Drug treatments have largely proven ineffective; it is thought that this is related to the heterogeneous nature and plasticity of GBM-initiating stem cell lineages. Although many combination drug therapies are being positioned to address tumour heterogeneity, the most promising therapeutic approaches for GBM to date appear to be those targeting GBM by vaccination or antibody- and cell-based immunotherapy. We review the most recent clinical trials for GBM and discuss the role of adaptive clinical trials in developing personalised treatment strategies to address intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Brain Neoplasms", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Drug Development", "Glioblastoma", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063060422", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"7004073394": {"Name": "Zanders E.", "AuthorID": "7004073394", "AffiliationID": "60022446", "AffiliationName": "IOTA Pharmaceuticals Ltd, St John's Innovation Centre"}, "6603427180": {"Name": "Svensson F.", "AuthorID": "6603427180", "AffiliationID": "60022446", "AffiliationName": "IOTA Pharmaceuticals Ltd, St John's Innovation Centre"}, "7402156085": {"Name": "Bailey D.", "AuthorID": "7402156085", "AffiliationID": "60022446", "AffiliationName": "IOTA Pharmaceuticals Ltd, St John's Innovation Centre"}}}
