An in silico scaffold-specific model under pulsatile perfusion provided by a bioreactor was implemented using a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) approach for viscoelastic tubular scaffolds (e.g. decellularized swine arteries, DSA). Results of working pressures, circumferential deformations, and wall shear stress on DSA fell within the desired physiological range and indicated the ability of this model to correctly predict the mechanical conditioning acting on the cells-scaffold system. Consequently, the FSI model allowed us to a priori define the stimulation pattern, driving in vitro physiological maturation of scaffolds, especially with viscoelastic properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioreactor", "circumferential deformations", "fluid-structure interaction model", "mechanical conditioning", "Small-caliber vessel tissue engineering", "wall shear stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Circumferential deformations", "Mechanical conditioning", "Physiological range", "Stimulation pattern", "Tissue engineered blood vessels", "Vascular tissue engineering", "Viscoelastic properties", "Wall shear stress", "Animals", "Arteries", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Bioreactors", "Blood Vessels", "Models, Theoretical", "Pressure", "Rheology", "Stress, Mechanical", "Swine", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020188964", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56667441200": {"Name": "Tresoldi C.", "AuthorID": "56667441200", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "49862614700": {"Name": "Bianchi E.", "AuthorID": "49862614700", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "56615988200": {"Name": "Pellegata A.", "AuthorID": "56615988200", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "7004855763": {"Name": "Dubini G.", "AuthorID": "7004855763", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "56211980000": {"Name": "Mantero S.", "AuthorID": "56211980000", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}}}
