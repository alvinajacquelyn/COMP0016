Epilepsia Open published by Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of International League Against Epilepsy.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. Epilepsy occurs in 80%-90% of affected individuals during their lifetime, and up to one-third of children with TSC will develop epileptic (infantile) spasms, for which vigabatrin has been shown to be particularly effective. Epilepsy severity and epileptic spasms are consistent markers of risk for the development of intellectual impairment in TSC. Although previous studies demonstrate a bimodal distribution of intellectual ability in TSC, recent findings suggest a unimodal distribution, which may reflect a change in IQ distribution over time. We compared 3 large historical UK cohorts of TSC (n = 331) that show varied distributions of intellectual ability, first ruling out differences in study methodology. Later-born individuals had a higher frequency of reported spasms and higher likelihood of vigabatrin administration, but were less likely to have profound intellectual impairment, compared to the earlier-born individuals. Our findings suggest that epileptic spasms went undetected in the older patients and therefore were not treated, leading to a higher occurrence of profound impairment, whereas the later born cohort had better access to treatment. These findings support the importance of early identification and treatment of seizures in TSC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy", "Infantile spasms", "IQ", "Tuberous sclerosis complex", "Vigabatrin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060830359", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"40561848200": {"Name": "Tye C.", "AuthorID": "40561848200", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and MRC Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "22946425500": {"Name": "Bolton P.F.", "AuthorID": "22946425500", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and MRC Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7403528155": {"Name": "Thomas L.E.", "AuthorID": "7403528155", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "57189363298": {"Name": "Sampson J.R.", "AuthorID": "57189363298", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "55483982300": {"Name": "Lewis J.", "AuthorID": "55483982300", "AffiliationID": "60138366", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Division, Anuerin Bevan University Health Board"}, "7004263408": {"Name": "O'Callaghan F.", "AuthorID": "7004263408", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57206944116": {"Name": "Yates J.R.W.", "AuthorID": "57206944116", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Cambridge"}}}
