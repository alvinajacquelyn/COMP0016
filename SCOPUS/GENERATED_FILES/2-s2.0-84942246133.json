Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Defining the RNA target selectivity of the proteins regulating mRNA metabolism is a key issue in RNA biology. Here we present a novel use of principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the RNA sequence preference of RNA binding proteins. We show that PCA can be used to compare the changes in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of a protein upon binding a set of quasi-degenerate RNAs and define the nucleobase specificity. We couple this application of PCA to an automated NMR spectra recording and processing protocol and obtain an unbiased and high-throughput NMR method for the analysis of nucleobase preference in protein-RNA interactions. We test the method on the RNA binding domains of three important regulators of RNA metabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Base Sequence", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Principal Component Analysis", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Recombinant Proteins", "RNA", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942246133", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56868191100": {"Name": "Collins K.", "AuthorID": "56868191100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56868170700": {"Name": "Robertson L.", "AuthorID": "56868170700", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Structure Division, MRC National Institute for Medical Research"}, "57193001984": {"Name": "Ramos A.", "AuthorID": "57193001984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "9838931600": {"Name": "Oregioni A.", "AuthorID": "9838931600", "AffiliationID": "60023477, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biomedical NMR Centre, MRC National Institute for Medical Research"}, "8249598000": {"Name": "Kelly G.", "AuthorID": "8249598000", "AffiliationID": "60023477, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biomedical NMR Centre, MRC National Institute for Medical Research"}}}
