These commonly include a standardised volcano alert level system (VALS), used in conjunction with other uni-valent communication techniques (such as information statements, reports and maps) and multi-directional techniques (such as meetings and telephone calls). This research, based on interviews and observation conducted 2007\u20132009 at the five US Geological Survey (USGS) volcano observatories, and including some of the key users of the VALS, argues for the importance of understanding how communicating volcanic hazard information takes place as an everyday social practice, focusing on the challenges of working across the boundaries between the scientific and decision-making communities. It is now widely accepted that the effective use, value and deployment of information across science-policy interfaces of this kind depend on three criteria: the scientific credibility of the information, its relevance to the needs of stakeholders and the legitimacy of both the information and the processes that produced it. Translation and two-way communication are required to ensure that all involved understand what information is credible and relevant. Findings indicate that whilst VALS play a role in raising awareness of an unfolding situation, supplementary communication techniques are crucial in facilitating situational understanding of that situation, and the uncertainties inherent to its scientific assessment, as well as in facilitating specific responses. In consequence, \u2018best practice\u2019 recommendations eschew further standardisation, and focus on the in situ cultivation of dialogue between scientists and stakeholders as a means of ensuring that information, and the processes through which it is produced are perceived to be legitimate by all involved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communication", "Decision-makers", "Volcano alert level systems", "Volcano monitoring", "Volcano observatories"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045380757", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"8869544900": {"Name": "Fearnley C.", "AuthorID": "8869544900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}, "56404433200": {"Name": "Beaven S.", "AuthorID": "56404433200", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Disaster Risk and Resilience Group, Department of Geological Sciences, University of Canterbury"}}}
