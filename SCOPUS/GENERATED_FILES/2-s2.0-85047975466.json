Methods: In this multicentre retrospective data analysis from electronic medical record, consecutive treatment-naive patients with nAMD treated with aflibercept with at least 2 years follow-up were stratified into those aged < 90 years (Group I) and an older cohort aged 90 and over (Group II). We compared the visual acuity (EDTRS letters) outcomes at 4 weekly intervals between the two groups over a 2-year period. Results: The mean visual acuity of Group I at presentation was 56.3 ETDRS letters versus 52.8 letters in Group II. Maximal visual acuity was achieved in both the groups by 6 months after initiating treatment (4.7 vs. 4.0 letters gain). By 2 years, the mean visual acuity of the older cohort fell marginally below their baseline visual acuity (0.8 letter loss), while Group I presented +2.1 letters gain. The number of injections given and the retention rate of the older cohort were no different to the rest of the patients. Conclusions: Very old patients with nAMD benefited from aflibercept, but not to the same degree as the younger patients. The study showed that, on an average, the very elderly patients were able to adhere to the intensive anti-VEGF treatment regimens.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Choroidal Neovascularization", "Female", "Humans", "Intravitreal Injections", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Retrospective Studies", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047975466", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"34969109700": {"Name": "Chatziralli I.", "AuthorID": "34969109700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57202351821": {"Name": "Regan S.O.", "AuthorID": "57202351821", "AffiliationID": "60022530", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Limerick"}, "57200550535": {"Name": "Mohamed R.", "AuthorID": "57200550535", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57196025212": {"Name": "Talks J.", "AuthorID": "57196025212", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6701680973": {"Name": "Lotery A.J.", "AuthorID": "6701680973", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602125798": {"Name": "Ghanchi F.", "AuthorID": "6602125798", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8560211600": {"Name": "Patel N.", "AuthorID": "8560211600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "14718897900": {"Name": "Bailey C.", "AuthorID": "14718897900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23995482000": {"Name": "Mahmood S.", "AuthorID": "23995482000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102068531": {"Name": "Lobo A.", "AuthorID": "7102068531", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57192643519": {"Name": "Paul B.", "AuthorID": "57192643519", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57202354660": {"Name": "Kashif Q.", "AuthorID": "57202354660", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57197656791": {"Name": "Santiago C.", "AuthorID": "57197656791", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7103148562": {"Name": "Walters G.", "AuthorID": "7103148562", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56038401300": {"Name": "Tahir M.", "AuthorID": "56038401300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "16507560200": {"Name": "Mushtaq B.", "AuthorID": "16507560200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57217512462": {"Name": "Ahmed", "AuthorID": "57217512462", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004041333": {"Name": "McKibbin M.", "AuthorID": "7004041333", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57220459994": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "57220459994", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
