However, ruminators often report intentionally engaging in repetitive thought due to its perceived benefits. Deliberate re-processing may lead to the appearance of a memory control deficit that is better explained as a difference in cognitive style.Methods Ninety-six undergraduate students volunteered to take part in a direct-suppression variant of the Think/No-Think paradigm after which they completed self-report measures of rumination and the degree to which they deliberately re-processed the to-be-suppressed items.Results We demonstrate a relation between rumination and impaired suppression-induced forgetting. This relation is robust even when controlling for deliberate re-processing of the to-be-suppressed items, a behavior itself related to both rumination and suppression. Therefore, whereas conscious fixation on to-be-suppressed items reduced memory suppression, it did not fully account for the relation between rumination and memory suppression.Limitations The current experiment employed a retrospective measure of deliberate re-processing in the context of an unscreened university sample; future research might therefore generalize our findings using an online measure of deliberate re-processing or within a clinical population.Conclusions We provide evidence that deliberate re-processing accounts for some - but not all - of the relation between rumination and suppression-induced forgetting. The present findings, observed in a paradigm known to engage top-down inhibitory modulation of mnemonic processing, provide the most theoretically focused evidence to date for the existence of a memory control deficit in rumination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inhibition", "Memory", "Retrieval suppression", "Rumination", "Think/no-think"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Memory Disorders", "Retrospective Studies", "Thinking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84913582209", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"25627951300": {"Name": "Fawcett J.M.", "AuthorID": "25627951300", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "55472527500": {"Name": "Anderson M.C.", "AuthorID": "55472527500", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "23990126300": {"Name": "Benoit R.G.", "AuthorID": "23990126300", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard University, Department of Psychology"}, "24390587000": {"Name": "Gagnepain P.", "AuthorID": "24390587000", "AffiliationID": "60005384", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, U1077"}, "56432314600": {"Name": "Salman A.", "AuthorID": "56432314600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55878185800": {"Name": "Bartholdy S.", "AuthorID": "55878185800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55918482200": {"Name": "Bradley C.", "AuthorID": "55918482200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57205964804": {"Name": "Chan D.K.Y.", "AuthorID": "57205964804", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56432187900": {"Name": "Roche A.", "AuthorID": "56432187900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
