Participants (N=24) included treatment-seeking individuals with concurrent cocaine and tobacco-use disorder (cigarette smokers). Participants were randomized to either running or walking (30 min per session, 3 times per week) or sitting (control condition) for 4 consecutive weeks. Several metrics indicated significant differences among runners, walkers, and sitters during sessions, including mean distance covered and calories burned. In addition, remote physiological monitoring showed that the groups differed significantly according to mean maximum heart rate (HR), respiration, and locomotor activity. Across the 4-week study, exercise improved fitness measures including significantly decreasing resting HR. Though not statistically significant, exercise improved abstinence from cocaine and increased self-reports of no cocaine use in last 24 h. In general, reductions in tobacco use and craving were not as robust. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of a multi-week exercise program in individuals with concurrent cocaine and tobacco-use disorder. The data clearly show significant improvements in basic fitness measures and several indices reveal that exercise improved both self-report and biochemically verified reports of cocaine abstinence. Taken together, the data from this study provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of exercise for improving fitness and reducing cocaine use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cigarette smoking", "Cocaine", "Exercise", "Nicotine", "Treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cocaine", "Cocaine-Related Disorders", "Craving", "Exercise", "Exercise Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Self Report", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Use Disorder"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982104148", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7003906211": {"Name": "De La Garza R.", "AuthorID": "7003906211", "AffiliationID": "60011641", "AffiliationName": "Michael E.
