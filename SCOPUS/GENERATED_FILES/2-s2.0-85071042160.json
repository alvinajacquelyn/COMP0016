No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Epilepsy surgery offers the chance of seizure remission for the 30%-40% of patients with focal epilepsy whose seizures continue despite anti-epileptic medications. Epilepsy surgery encompasses curative resective procedures, palliative techniques such as corpus callosotomy and implantation of stimulation devices. Pre-surgical evaluation aims to identify the epileptogenic zone and to prevent post-operative neurological and cognitive deficits. This entails optimal imaging, prolonged video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments; some patients may then require nuclear medicine imaging and intracranial EEG recording. The best outcomes are in those with an electro-clinically concordant structural lesion on MRI (60%-70% seizure freedom). Lower rates of seizure freedom are expected in people with extra-temporal lobe foci, focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, normal structural imaging, psychiatric co-morbidity and learning disability. Nevertheless, surgery for epilepsy is under-used and should be considered for all patients with refractory focal epilepsy in whom two or three anti-epileptic medications have been ineffective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epilepsy", "epilepsy surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticonvulsants", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsies, Partial", "Humans", "Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring", "Preoperative Care", "Seizures", "Stereotaxic Techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071042160", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6603148747": {"Name": "Rugg-Gunn F.", "AuthorID": "6603148747", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57215499053": {"Name": "Miserocchi A.", "AuthorID": "57215499053", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London Institute of Neurology"}}}
