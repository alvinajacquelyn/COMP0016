While this model has received support in clinical samples, it has not been tested at the general population level. Analysis was conducted on Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 34 653). Twentytwo psychotic symptoms were used as observed indicators of psychosis. These items were chosen based on their conceptual similarity to the items used in a similar study based on clinical samples. Confirmatory factor analysis and confirmatory bifactor modeling were used to test a variety of competing models. The best fitting model consisted of a general psychosis factor that was uncorrelated with 5 specific factors: positive, negative, disorganization, mania, and depression. These findings suggest that the bifactor model can be extended to general population samples, supporting the continuity between clinical and subclinical psychotic experiences. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychotic Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014275208", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Ulster University, Psychology Research Institute"}, "56079814100": {"Name": "McElroy E.", "AuthorID": "56079814100", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Ulster University, Psychology Research Institute"}, "7404113856": {"Name": "Murphy J.", "AuthorID": "7404113856", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Ulster University, Psychology Research Institute"}, "56823917300": {"Name": "Bentall R.P.", "AuthorID": "56823917300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Liverpool"}, "35796165100": {"Name": "Reininghaus U.", "AuthorID": "35796165100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University"}}}
