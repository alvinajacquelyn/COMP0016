This study examined whether global and regional brain volumes differed between \u201cyounger\u201d and \u201colder\u201d onset MS subjects who were matched for short disease duration, mean 1.9 years and burden as measured by the MS Severity Score and relapses. 21 younger-onset MS subjects (age 30.4 \u00b1 3.2 years) were compared with 17 older-onset (age 48.7 \u00b1 3.3 years) as well as age-matched controls (n = 31, 31.9 \u00b1 3.5 years and n = 21, 47.3 \u00b1 4.0 years). All subjects underwent 3D volumetric T1 and T2-FLAIR imaging. White matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) lesions were outlined manually. Lesions were filled prior to tissue and structural segmentation to reduce classification errors. Volume loss versus control was predominantly in the subcortical GM, at > 13% loss. Younger and older-onset MS subjects had similar, strong excess loss in the putamen, thalamus, and nucleus accumbens. No excess loss was detected in the amygdala or pallidum. The hippocampus and caudate showed significant excess loss in the younger group (p < 0.001) and a strong trend in the older-onset group. These results provide a potential imaging correlate of published neuropsychological studies that reported the association of younger age at disease onset with impaired cognitive performance, including decreased working memory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrophy", "Grey matter", "Image analysis", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Age of Onset", "Aging", "Amygdala", "Atrophy", "Corpus Striatum", "Gray Matter", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Thalamus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997403778", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57072653400": {"Name": "Bishop C.A.", "AuthorID": "57072653400", "AffiliationID": "60109255", "AffiliationName": "Imanova Centre for Imaging Sciences"}, "8301920900": {"Name": "Newbould R.D.", "AuthorID": "8301920900", "AffiliationID": "60109255", "AffiliationName": "Imanova Centre for Imaging Sciences"}, "56123396800": {"Name": "Lee J.S.Z.", "AuthorID": "56123396800", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "53363233200": {"Name": "Ali R.", "AuthorID": "53363233200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55988576400": {"Name": "Mattoscio M.", "AuthorID": "55988576400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "36939909700": {"Name": "Cortese A.", "AuthorID": "36939909700", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "15768161200": {"Name": "Nicholas R.", "AuthorID": "15768161200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7202324607": {"Name": "Matthews P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202324607", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "6603762066": {"Name": "Muraro P.A.", "AuthorID": "6603762066", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "57216675262": {"Name": "Waldman A.D.", "AuthorID": "57216675262", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56353269100": {"Name": "Honeyfield L.", "AuthorID": "56353269100", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "16067576300": {"Name": "Quest R.", "AuthorID": "16067576300", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55894880600": {"Name": "Colasanti A.", "AuthorID": "55894880600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
