The allocation of revenue risk is of paramount importance for the successful implementation of such projects and a sub-optimal allocation may lead to project structuring that is unnecessarily expensive and vulnerable to failure. At the same time, the revenue risk depends critically on the remuneration model used (user-based versus budget-based) and may, in turn, take the form of demand risk, counterparty risk or combinations of the two. This review explores the issues related to revenue risk allocation for transport infrastructure PPP projects. Overarching principles for the allocation of revenue risk that transcend mode-specificity are identified and compared to case studies generated in the context of the COST Action TU1001. The results show that theory and practice are divergent, leading to sub-optimal structuring and exposing projects to potential failure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["infrastructure", "public\u2013private partnerships", "revenue risk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924625534", "SubjectAreas": [["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"11940164700": {"Name": "Roumboutsos A.", "AuthorID": "11940164700", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Shipping, Trade and Transport, University of the Aegean"}, "26533154100": {"Name": "Pantelias A.", "AuthorID": "26533154100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction & Project Management, UCL"}}}
