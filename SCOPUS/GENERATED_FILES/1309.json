This study evaluated predictors of vocational activity for first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients during the first year of EIS care. It was hypothesized that longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and minority ethnic status would predict poorer vocational outcomes, whereas a history of good vocational functioning would predict better vocational functioning during follow up. Methods: FEP patients aged 14-35 years, who presented to seven EIS in London, UK, between 2003 and 2010, were followed for 1 year. Sociodemographic, clinical and vocational information (qualifications obtained and paid employment) were collected using the MiData audit tool at entry to EIS and 1 year later. Results: Approximately one-third of patients (n=345/1013) were studying or employed at some point during the first year of EIS care. Baseline vocational activity was the strongest predictor of vocational functioning during 1 year of follow up. Moreover, employment prior to entry into EIS strongly predicted change in vocational activity during 1 year of follow up. Individuals with DUP <6 months or of Asian or black African origin were more likely to be studying than their white British counterparts. Conclusion: This study confirms that a significant proportion of FEP patients are able to engage in meaningful vocational activities even within the first year of EIS care. However, services need to focus more resources on getting patients with poor educational or employment histories into training programmes to improve their vocational outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early intervention", "Education", "Employment", "First-episode psychosis", "Vocational outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Early Medical Intervention", "Employment", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Psychotic Disorders", "Rehabilitation, Vocational", "Time Factors", "Urban Population", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945178507", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56041717800": {"Name": "Tapfumaneyi A.", "AuthorID": "56041717800", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Lewisham Early Intervention Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201370215": {"Name": "Joyce J.", "AuthorID": "7201370215", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Lewisham Early Intervention Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "56042259300": {"Name": "Mann F.", "AuthorID": "56042259300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "26428394200": {"Name": "Major B.", "AuthorID": "26428394200", "AffiliationID": "60099152", "AffiliationName": "EQUIP, Hackney, East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402698929": {"Name": "Lawrence J.", "AuthorID": "7402698929", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "STEP, Southwark, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "19433994800": {"Name": "Chisholm B.", "AuthorID": "19433994800", "AffiliationID": "60025781", "AffiliationName": "Wandsworth Early Intervention Service, Southwest London and St Georges' Mental Health NHS Trust"}, "56040958300": {"Name": "Wooley J.", "AuthorID": "56040958300", "AffiliationID": "60025781", "AffiliationName": "Wandsworth Early Intervention Service, Southwest London and St Georges' Mental Health NHS Trust"}, "10538833900": {"Name": "Rahaman N.", "AuthorID": "10538833900", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Kensington, Chelsea, Westminster and Brent Early Intervention Service, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9235818300": {"Name": "Fisher H.L.", "AuthorID": "9235818300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}}}
