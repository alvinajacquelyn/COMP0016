Literature and film depicting the Nationale Volksarmee of East Germany (NVA) present uniform's narrative of ideal military masculinity in conflict with a second, apparently more natural narrative of masculinity written on the body. Claus Dobberke's Ein Katzensprung (1976) and J\u00fcrgen Fuchs's Fassonschnitt (1984) explore ways that the body might subvert the effects of uniform. Ultimately, however, these two works depict the uniform transforming body and psyche and unsettling existing narratives of masculinity, even disrupting the narrative text itself.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000900018", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"55637514900": {"Name": "Smith T.", "AuthorID": "55637514900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
