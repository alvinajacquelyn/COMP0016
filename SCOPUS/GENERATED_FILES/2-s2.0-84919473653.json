Our aim was to investigate inequalities using diverse indicators of oral health and 4 socioeconomic determinants, in the context of age and cohort. Multiple linear or logistic regressions were estimated for 7 oral health measures representing very different outcomes (2 caries prevalence measures, decayed/missing/filled teeth, 6-mm pockets, number of teeth, anterior spaces, and excellent oral health) against 4 socioeconomic measures (income, education, Index of Multiple Deprivation, and occupational social class) for adults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 21 y in the 2009 UK Adult Dental Health Survey data set. Confounders were adjusted and marginal effects calculated. The results showed highly variable relationships for the different combinations of variables and that age group was critical, with different relationships at different ages. There were significant income inequalities in caries prevalence in the youngest age group, marginal effects of 0.10 to 0.18, representing a 10- to 18-percentage point increase in the probability of caries between the wealthiest and every other quintile, but there was not a clear gradient across the quintiles. With number of teeth as an outcome, there were significant income gradients after adjustment in older groups, up to 4.5 teeth (95% confidence interval, 2.2-6.8) between richest and poorest but none for the younger groups. For periodontal disease, income inequalities were mediated by other socioeconomic variables and smoking, while for anterior spaces, the relationships were age dependent and complex. In conclusion, oral health inequalities manifest in different ways in different age groups, representing age and cohort effects. Income sometimes has an independent relationship, but education and area of residence are also contributory. Appropriate choices of measures in relation to age are fundamental if we are to understand and address inequalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dental caries", "healthcare disparity", "income", "periodontal diseases", "socioeconomic factors", "tooth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Attitude to Health", "Cohort Studies", "Dental Caries", "Dentition", "DMF Index", "Educational Status", "Female", "Great Britain", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Income", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupations", "Oral Health", "Periodontal Pocket", "Prevalence", "Residence Characteristics", "Smoking", "Social Class", "Tooth Loss", "Vulnerable Populations", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919473653", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"7402403867": {"Name": "Steele J.", "AuthorID": "7402403867", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Dental Sciences, Centre for Oral Health Research, Newcastle University"}, "56251350300": {"Name": "Shen J.", "AuthorID": "56251350300", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "26640375700": {"Name": "Guarnizo-Herre\u00f1o C.", "AuthorID": "26640375700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56389335900": {"Name": "Fuller E.", "AuthorID": "56389335900", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen Social Research"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College"}, "6701448160": {"Name": "Wildman J.", "AuthorID": "6701448160", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Newcastle Business School, Newcastle University"}}}
