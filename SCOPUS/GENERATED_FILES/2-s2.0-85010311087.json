The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We explore the effects of specific assumptions in the subgrid models of star formation and stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback on intrinsic alignments of galaxies in cosmological simulations of the \"MassiveBlack-II\" family. Using smaller-volume simulations, we explore the parameter space of the subgrid star formation and feedback model and find remarkable robustness of the observable statistical measures to the details of subgrid physics. The one observational probe most sensitive to modeling details is the distribution of misalignment angles. We hypothesize that the amount of angular momentum carried away by the galactic wind is the primary physical quantity that controls the orientation of the stellar distribution. Our results are also consistent with a similar study by the EAGLE simulation team.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmology: theory", "galaxies: star formation", "gravitational lensing: weak", "hydrodynamics", "methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010311087", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56152658800": {"Name": "Tenneti A.", "AuthorID": "56152658800", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "7003491129": {"Name": "Gnedin N.", "AuthorID": "7003491129", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Chicago"}, "54580801600": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "54580801600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, Department of Physics, University of California Berkeley"}}}
