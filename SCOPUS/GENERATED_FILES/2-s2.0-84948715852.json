American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.We use global MHD simulations to model the magnetospheric response to an inclined shock that first strikes the duskside magnetosphere. The simulations predict several phenomena related specifically to the inclined shocks. The magnetospheric compression on the duskside exceeds that on the dawnside, and the geocentric distance to the dusk magnetopause varies in a simple step-like form. The compression on the dawnside is preceded and followed by expansions. For a moderately strong shock, the expansion magnitude reaches several RE behind the terminator plane. The magnetopause and cross-tail currents in the magnetotail are significantly deformed during and after the shock passage. The position of the magnetotail magnetopause moves by more than 10 RE. This asymmetric magnetopause deformation is mainly related to a strong |Vy| downstream from the inclined shock. The magnetospheric expansion results in a decrease in the horizontal magnetic field at low-latitude stations, as confirmed by observations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asymmetric magnetopause motion", "inclined interplanetary shocks", "sudden impulse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-tail currents", "Global MHD simulation", "Horizontal magnetic fields", "Interplanetary shocks", "Low latitudes", "Magnetopause motion", "Magnetospheric response", "Sudden impulse"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948715852", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"36843137800": {"Name": "Samsonov A.A.", "AuthorID": "36843137800", "AffiliationID": "60031888", "AffiliationName": "Saint-Petersburg State University"}, "7202471790": {"Name": "Sergeev V.A.", "AuthorID": "7202471790", "AffiliationID": "60031888", "AffiliationName": "Saint-Petersburg State University"}, "57216378357": {"Name": "Kuznetsova M.M.", "AuthorID": "57216378357", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "7003293674": {"Name": "Sibeck D.G.", "AuthorID": "7003293674", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}}}
