Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study was carried out in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. All residents aged \u2265 15 years were eligible for HBHCT. Those who tested positive and were not in care were referred for ART at one of 11 public-sector clinics. Individuals who did not attend the clinic within 2 weeks were sent a short message service (SMS) reminder; those who had not attended after a further 2 weeks were telephoned by a nurse counsellor, to discuss concerns and encourage linkage. Kaplan\u2013Meier methods were used to estimate the proportion of newly diagnosed individuals linking to care and initiating ART. Results: Among 38 827 individuals visited, 26% accepted HBHCT. Uptake was higher in women than in men (30% versus 20%, respectively), but similar in people aged < 30 years and \u2265 30 years (28% versus 26%, respectively). A total of 784 (8%) tested HIV positive, of whom 427 (54%) were newly diagnosed. Within 6 months, 31% of women and 18% of men < 30 years old had linked to care, and 29% and 16%, respectively, had started ART. Among those \u2265 30 years, 41% of women and 38% of men had linked to care within 6 months, and 41% and 35%, respectively, had started ART. Conclusions: Despite facilitated linkage, rates of timely linkage to care and ART initiation after HBHCT were very low, particularly among young men. Innovations are needed to provide effective HIV care and prevention interventions to young people, and thus maximize the benefits of universal test and treat.", "AuthorKeywords": ["linkage to care", "prevention", "South Africa", "testing", "treatment", "universal test and treat"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Counseling", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Prospective Studies", "Referral and Consultation", "Rural Population", "South Africa", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071265765", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6602372286": {"Name": "Baisley K.J.", "AuthorID": "6602372286", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57210784629": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "57210784629", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57210700512": {"Name": "Koole K.", "AuthorID": "57210700512", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "16235029000": {"Name": "Siedner M.J.", "AuthorID": "16235029000", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard School of Public Health"}, "23051263900": {"Name": "Matthews P.", "AuthorID": "23051263900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "6603089893": {"Name": "Tanser F.", "AuthorID": "6603089893", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "23011726900": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "23011726900", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "University of Heidelberg"}, "7006988777": {"Name": "Smit T.", "AuthorID": "7006988777", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "36008404700": {"Name": "Gareta D.", "AuthorID": "36008404700", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57204342963": {"Name": "Dlamini S.", "AuthorID": "57204342963", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "16645460600": {"Name": "Herbst K.", "AuthorID": "16645460600", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "35785410300": {"Name": "Yapa H.M.", "AuthorID": "35785410300", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "The Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Sydney"}, "25641410300": {"Name": "Iwuji C.C.", "AuthorID": "25641410300", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Infection, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "57206211152": {"Name": "Kim H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57206211152", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006172333": {"Name": "Shahmanesh M.", "AuthorID": "7006172333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
