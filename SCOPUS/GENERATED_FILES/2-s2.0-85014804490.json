In particular on aircraft, it can change aerodynamic characteristics, greatly affecting the flight safety. Commercial aircraft are therefore required to be equipped with de-icing devices, such as heating mats over the wings. The application of icephobic coatings near the leading edge of a wing can in theory reduce the high power requirements of heating mats, which melt ice that forms there. Such coatings are effective in preventing the accretion of runback ice, formed from airborne supercooled droplets, or the water that the heating mats generate as it is sheared back over the wing's upper surface. However, the durability and the practicality of applying them over a large wing surface have been prohibitive factors in deploying this technology so far. Here, we evaluated the ice adhesion strength of four non-conductive coatings and seven thermally conductive coatings by shearing ice samples from coated plates by spinning them in a centrifuge device. The durability of the coating performance was also assessed by repeating the tests, each time regrowing ice samples on the previously-used coatings. Contact angle parameters of each coating were tested for each test to determine influence on ice adhesion strength. The results indicate that contact angle hysteresis is a crucial parameter in determining icephobicity of a coating and hydrophobicity is not necessarily linked to icephobicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerofoil icing", "Centrifuge.", "Icephobic coatings", "Runback icing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerodynamic characteristics", "Commercial aircraft", "Conductive coatings", "Contact angle hysteresis", "Ice adhesion strength", "Rail infrastructure", "Runback icing", "Supercooled droplets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014804490", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57193063307": {"Name": "Janjua Z.", "AuthorID": "57193063307", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "16235490500": {"Name": "Turnbull B.", "AuthorID": "16235490500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "57209189776": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57209189776", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "9247715100": {"Name": "Hou X.", "AuthorID": "9247715100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "36160863200": {"Name": "Choi K.", "AuthorID": "36160863200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "57203183054": {"Name": "Choy K.", "AuthorID": "57203183054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL)"}, "18936516600": {"Name": "Pandis C.", "AuthorID": "18936516600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL)"}}}
