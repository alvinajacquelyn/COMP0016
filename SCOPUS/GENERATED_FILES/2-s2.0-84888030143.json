The purpose of this paper is to explore how extensive that assistance is in respect of people whose difficulties are multiple and profound. I am concerned with one aspect of capability theory in particular; namely, the place accorded to the concept and value of freedom. I argue that capability theory exaggerates the importance of freedom as a basic value for egalitarian evaluation. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capability", "equality", "freedom", "multiple and profound disabilities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84888030143", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"16204595900": {"Name": "Vorhaus J.", "AuthorID": "16204595900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}}}
