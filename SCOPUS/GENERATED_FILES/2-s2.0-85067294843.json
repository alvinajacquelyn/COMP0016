We also agree with them over the relative threat of plastic to our oceans. However, recent evidence on the \u2018spillover effect\u2019 of pro-environmental behaviours and on public attitudes to threats to areas such as the Great Barrier Reef suggest common consumerist and political approaches to tackle plastic pollution can cause a distraction from issues caused by climate change and biodiversity loss. We reiterate that we need political changes to address overconsumption in order to make real progress on all environmental issues.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067294843", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"14007374300": {"Name": "Stafford R.", "AuthorID": "14007374300", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Bournemouth University"}, "55474784800": {"Name": "Jones P.J.S.", "AuthorID": "55474784800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
