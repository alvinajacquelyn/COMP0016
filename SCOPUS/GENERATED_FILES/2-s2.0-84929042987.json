One reason is that studies on motor skills often conflate motor cortex's established role in dexterous control with roles in learning and producing task-specific motor sequences. To dissociate these aspects, we developed a motor task for rats that trains spatiotemporally precise movement patterns without requirements for dexterity. Remarkably, motor cortex lesions had no discernible effect on the acquired skills, which were expressed in their distinct pre-lesion forms on the very first day of post-lesion training. Motor cortex lesions prior to training, however, rendered rats unable to acquire the stereotyped motor sequences required for the task. These results suggest a remarkable capacity of subcortical motor circuits to execute learned skills and a previously unappreciated role for motor cortex in \"tutoring\" these circuits during learning. Motor cortex is widely credited with expanding the behavioral repertoire of mammals by enabling the acquisition and execution of new motor skills, but its specific contributions have been difficult to pin down. Using a novel motor skill learning paradigm, Kawai etal. show that motor cortex contributes to learning skills even when it is not required to execute them. This demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for motor cortex in \"tutoring\" subcortical circuits during skill learning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Conditioning, Operant", "Executive Function", "Female", "Forelimb", "Functional Laterality", "Ibotenic Acid", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Motor Skills", "Movement", "Neural Pathways", "Rats", "Rats, Long-Evans", "Reward", "Statistics as Topic", "Stereotyped Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929042987", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55995073000": {"Name": "Kawai R.", "AuthorID": "55995073000", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Program in Biophysics, Harvard University"}, "57220759730": {"Name": "Markman T.", "AuthorID": "57220759730", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Science, Harvard University"}, "55873594300": {"Name": "Poddar R.", "AuthorID": "55873594300", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Program in Neuroscience, Harvard University"}, "56592045800": {"Name": "Ko R.", "AuthorID": "56592045800", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}, "24757894600": {"Name": "Fantana A.L.", "AuthorID": "24757894600", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}, "36645761700": {"Name": "Dhawale A.K.", "AuthorID": "36645761700", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}, "13005844800": {"Name": "Kampff A.R.", "AuthorID": "13005844800", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Center for the Unknown"}, "6603140681": {"Name": "\u00d6lveczky B.P.", "AuthorID": "6603140681", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}}}
