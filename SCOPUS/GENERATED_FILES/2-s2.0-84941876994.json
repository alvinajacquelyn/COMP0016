Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Municipal Solid Waste in general and its organic fraction in particular is a potential renewable and non-seasonal resource. In this work, a life cycle assessment has been performed to evaluate the environmental impacts of two future scenarios using biogas produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) to supply energy to a group of dwellings, respectively comprising distributed generation using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) micro-CHP systems and condensing boilers. The London Borough of Greenwich is taken as the reference case study. The system is designed to assess how much energy demand can be met and what is the best way to use the digestible waste for distributed energy purposes. The system is compared with two alternative scenarios fuelled by natural gas: a reference scenario, where the electricity is supplied by the grid and the heat is supplied from condensing boilers, and a fuel cell micro-CHP system. The results show that, although OFMSW alone can only supply between 1% and 4% of the total energy demand of the Borough, a saving of \u223c130 tonnes of CO2 eq per year per dwelling equipped with micro-CHP is still achievable compared with the reference scenario. This is primarily due to the surplus electricity produced by the fuel cell when the micro-CHP unit is operated to meet the heat demand. Use of biogas to produce heat only is therefore a less desirable option compared with combined heat and power production. Further investigation is required to identify locally available feedstock other than OFMSW in order to increase the proportion of energy demand that can be met in this way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biogas", "Distributed generation", "LCA", "Micro-CHP", "OFMSW", "SOFC"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combined heat and power production", "Distributed energies", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Life cycle perspectives", "Micro-CHP", "OFMSW", "Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes", "Proportion of energy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941876994", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"54966700100": {"Name": "Evangelisti S.", "AuthorID": "54966700100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "7101769541": {"Name": "Clift R.", "AuthorID": "7101769541", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey"}, "57191542088": {"Name": "Borello D.", "AuthorID": "57191542088", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "DIMA, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"}}}
