The aim of this study was to examine the replacement effects of sedentary behaviour (total sitting, television/computer screen time combined), sleeping, standing, walking, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on all-cause mortality using isotemporal substitution modelling. Methods: Longitudinal analysis (4.22\u00b10 9years follow-up/849,369 person-years) of 201,129 participants of the 45 and Up study aged \u226545years from New South Wales, Australia. Results: Seven thousand four hundredandsixty deaths occurred over follow-up. There were beneficial associations for replacing total sitting time with standing (per-hour HR: 95 % CI: 0.95, 0.94-0.96), walking (0.86, 0.81-0.90), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (0.88, 0.85-0.90), and sleeping in those sleeping\u22647h/day (0.94, 0.90-0.98). Similar associations were noted for replacing screen time. Replacing one hour of walking or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with any other activity class was associated with an increased mortality risk by 7-18%. Excluding deaths in the first 24months of the follow up and restricting analyses to those who were healthy at baseline did not materially change the above observations. Conclusion: Although replacing sedentary behaviour with walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are associated with the lowest mortality risk, replacements with equal amounts of standing and sleeping (in low sleepers only) arealso linked to substantial mortality risk reductions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "Isotemporal substitution", "Longitudinal", "Mortality", "Mortality", "Physical activity", "Population cohort", "Prevention", "Public health", "Screen time", "Sedentary behaviour", "Sitting", "Sleeping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Australia", "Computers", "Exercise", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "New South Wales", "Posture", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Sleep", "Television", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942578016", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL-PARG (Physical Activity Research Group), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "14032757100": {"Name": "Chau J.", "AuthorID": "14032757100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "25421265100": {"Name": "Bauman A.", "AuthorID": "25421265100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, Loughborough University"}, "35086793300": {"Name": "Rogers K.", "AuthorID": "35086793300", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "57213161043": {"Name": "Ding D.", "AuthorID": "57213161043", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Public Health, San Diego State University"}, "7004503131": {"Name": "Berrigan D.", "AuthorID": "7004503131", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Institute, Behavioral Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences"}}}
