We evaluated our clinical management of RS risk in patients starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Methods: Patients commencing TPN at University College London Hospital between January and July 2015 were prospectively followed-up for 7-days. Eighty patients were risk assessed for RS and categorized into risk groups. High and low risk RS groups were compared focussing on the onset of biochemical features of RS (hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesemia) and initial clinical assessment. Statistical analysis was conducted using t-tests and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests. Results: Sixty patients (75%) were identified as high-risk for RS and received lower initial calories (12.8 kcal/kg/day, p < 0.05). All high-risk patients received a high potency vitamin preparation compared to 35% in the low risk group (p < 0.05). Daily phosphate, magnesium and potassium plasma levels were monitored for seven days in 25%, 30% and 53.8% of patients, respectively. Hypophosphatemia developed in 30% and hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia in 27.5% of all patients. Approximately 84% of patients had one or more electrolyte abnormalities, which occurred more frequently in high-risk RS patients (p < 0.05). Low risk patients developed mild hypophosphatemia at a much lower percentage than high-risk RS (20% vs 33.3%, respectively). Conclusion: A significant proportion of patients commencing TPN developed biochemical features of RS (but no more serious complications) despite nutritional assessment, treatment, and follow up in accordance with national recommendations. High vs low risk RS patients were more likely to have electrolyte abnormalities after receiving TPN regardless of preventative measures. Additional research is required to further optimise the initial nutritional approach to prevent RS in high-risk patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hypokalaemia", "Hypomagnesaemia", "Hypophosphatemia", "Refeeding syndrome", "Total parenteral nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "London", "Magnesium", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nutrition Assessment", "Parenteral Nutrition, Total", "Phosphates", "Potassium", "Prospective Studies", "Refeeding Syndrome", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Factors", "Tertiary Care Centers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049584837", "SubjectAreas": [["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57202852034": {"Name": "Pantoja F.", "AuthorID": "57202852034", "AffiliationID": "60017912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Nutrition, Cl\u00ednica Las Condes"}, "56115678000": {"Name": "Fragkos K.C.", "AuthorID": "56115678000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35316524300": {"Name": "Patel P.S.", "AuthorID": "35316524300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56089132100": {"Name": "Keane N.", "AuthorID": "56089132100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55552865800": {"Name": "Samaan M.A.", "AuthorID": "55552865800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6505494856": {"Name": "Barnova I.", "AuthorID": "6505494856", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602354517": {"Name": "Di Caro S.", "AuthorID": "6602354517", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56402425500": {"Name": "Mehta S.J.", "AuthorID": "56402425500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12647293500": {"Name": "Rahman F.", "AuthorID": "12647293500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
