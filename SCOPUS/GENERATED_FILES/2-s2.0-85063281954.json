The great henge complexes of southern Britain are iconic monuments of the third millennium BCE, representing great feats of engineering and labor mobilization that hosted feasting events on a previously unparalleled scale. The scale of movement and the catchments that the complexes served, however, have thus far eluded understanding. Presenting the largest five-isotope system archeological dataset ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 34 S, 18 O, 13 C, and 15 N) yet fully published, we analyze 131 pigs, the prime feasting animals, from four Late Neolithic (approximately 2800 to 2400 BCE) complexes to explore the networks that the feasts served. Because archeological evidence excludes continental contact, sources are considered only in the context of the British Isles. This analysis reveals wide-ranging origins across Britain, with few pigs raised locally. This finding demonstrates great investment of effort in transporting pigs raised elsewhere over vast distances to supply feasts and evidences the very first phase of pan-British connectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Britain", "British Isles", "Isotope analysis", "Isotope systems", "Stonehenge", "Animals", "Archaeology", "Carbon Isotopes", "Female", "History, Ancient", "Holidays", "Human Migration", "Humans", "Male", "Mandible", "Meat", "Nitrogen Isotopes", "Oxygen Isotopes", "Radiometric Dating", "Strontium Isotopes", "Sulfur Isotopes", "Swine", "Transportation", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063281954", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"45161754500": {"Name": "Madgwick R.", "AuthorID": "45161754500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of History, Archaeology and Religion, Cardiff University"}, "7102445484": {"Name": "Lamb A.L.", "AuthorID": "7102445484", "AffiliationID": "60022706, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, British Geological Survey"}, "6701858892": {"Name": "Sloane H.", "AuthorID": "6701858892", "AffiliationID": "60022706, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, British Geological Survey"}, "7407665225": {"Name": "Evans J.A.", "AuthorID": "7407665225", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Classics and Archaeology, University of Nottingham"}, "6701358215": {"Name": "Nederbragt A.J.", "AuthorID": "6701358215", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "8267110000": {"Name": "Albarella U.", "AuthorID": "8267110000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield"}, "6507314762": {"Name": "Parker Pearson M.", "AuthorID": "6507314762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
