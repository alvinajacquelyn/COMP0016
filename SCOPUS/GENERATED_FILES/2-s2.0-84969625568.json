The development of such treatments has been hampered by the lack of non-invasive biomarkers that could be used to identify the patients at-risk, thereby allowing to design affordable clinical studies. Our goal was to test the predictive value of cognitive deficits and brain astrocyte activation for the development of epilepsy following a potential epileptogenic injury. We used a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine-evoked status epilepticus (SE) in 21-day old rats where 60-70% of animals develop spontaneous seizures after around 70 days, although SE is similar in all rats. Learning was evaluated in the Morris water-maze at days 15 and 65 post-SE, each time followed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for measuring hippocampal myo-Inositol levels, a marker of astrocyte activation. Rats were video-EEG monitored for two weeks at seven months post-SE to detect spontaneous seizures, then brain histology was done. Behavioral and imaging data were retrospectively analysed in epileptic rats and compared with non-epileptic and control animals. Rats displayed spatial learning deficits within three weeks from SE. However, only epilepsy-prone rats showed accelerated forgetting and reduced learning rate compared to both rats not developing epilepsy and controls. These deficits were associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. myo-Inositol levels increased transiently in the hippocampus of SE-rats not developing epilepsy while this increase persisted until spontaneous seizures onset in epilepsy-prone rats, being associated with a local increase in S100\u03b2-positive astrocytes. Neuronal cell loss was similar in all SE-rats. Our data show that behavioral deficits, together with a non-invasive marker of astrocyte activation, predict which rats develop epilepsy after an acute injury. These measures have potential clinical relevance for identifying individuals at-risk for developing epilepsy following exposure to epileptogenic insults, and consequently, for designing adequately powered antiepileptogenesis trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Biomarker", "Comorbidities", "Epileptogenesis", "Hippocampus", "Imaging", "Learning and memory", "Status epilepticus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroencephalography", "Male", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Status Epilepticus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969625568", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"57189353846": {"Name": "Pascente R.", "AuthorID": "57189353846", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "54388357400": {"Name": "Frigerio F.", "AuthorID": "54388357400", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "10242127900": {"Name": "Rizzi M.", "AuthorID": "10242127900", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "56313131200": {"Name": "Tolomeo D.", "AuthorID": "56313131200", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "8906306900": {"Name": "Filibian M.", "AuthorID": "8906306900", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Pavia"}, "35494833300": {"Name": "Vezzani A.", "AuthorID": "35494833300", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "6603015717": {"Name": "Ravizza T.", "AuthorID": "6603015717", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "25655219500": {"Name": "Porcu L.", "AuthorID": "25655219500", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "8847781200": {"Name": "Boido M.", "AuthorID": "8847781200", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute Cavalieri Ottolenghi, Department of Neuroscience, University of Torino"}, "57189353001": {"Name": "Davids J.", "AuthorID": "57189353001", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "16053597900": {"Name": "Zaben M.", "AuthorID": "16053597900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7201707615": {"Name": "Gray W.P.", "AuthorID": "7201707615", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}}}
