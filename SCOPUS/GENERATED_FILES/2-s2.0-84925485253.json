Over the last 14 years, there has been increasing evidence to suggest that these tumours are distinct pathological entities to pilocytic astrocytomas. Radiological features of these tumours are slowly emerging in the neuroradiological literature. We report a unique radiological appearance of a multicystic, disseminated astrocytoma with pilomyxoid characteristics presenting in a 4-year-old boy and highlight the importance of considering this diagnosis with similar imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytoma", "Cerebellar hemisphere", "Disseminated", "Leptomeningeal infiltration", "Multicystic", "Pilomyxoid", "Spinal cord", "Ventricles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, CD", "Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic", "Astrocytoma", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Hypothalamic Neoplasms", "Ki-67 Antigen", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Spinal Cord", "Third Ventricle", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925485253", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55819123400": {"Name": "Amarasinghe S.G.", "AuthorID": "55819123400", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Wales"}, "56396869900": {"Name": "Ben-ali H.", "AuthorID": "56396869900", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7007026020": {"Name": "Hatfield R.H.", "AuthorID": "7007026020", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Wales"}, "14525179500": {"Name": "Leach P.A.", "AuthorID": "14525179500", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health and Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
