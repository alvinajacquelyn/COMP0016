Within this context, the scientific literature puts emphasis on energy topics and energy policy. Studies from the social science, economics and management science perspectives would benefit from a coherent and recognized taxonomy of the subthemes, a taxonomy that spans disciplines and guides studies of the carbon reduction and technology (CRT) debate in the various industrial sectors. This paper identifies and analyses the existing body of literature; it systematically reviews a set of 3310 scholarly contributions. The study also conducts a semantic social network analysis from that dataset's keywords, identifying promising core themes. Findings include the need for more management research in this field, the need for an interdisciplinary research agenda. We also observe a growing contribution of the Chinese academy to this complex and diversified debate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon reduction", "China", "Industrial sustainability", "Technology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon reduction", "China", "Industrial sector", "Industrial sustainability", "Interdisciplinary research", "Management research", "Scientific literature", "Semantic social network analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953361740", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"53464407900": {"Name": "Slowak A.P.", "AuthorID": "53464407900", "AffiliationID": "60159731", "AffiliationName": "School of Business and Law, University of East London"}, "24768283100": {"Name": "Taticchi P.", "AuthorID": "24768283100", "AffiliationID": "60116484", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Business School, South Kensington Campus, Tanaka Building"}}}
