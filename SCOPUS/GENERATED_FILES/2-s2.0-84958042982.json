Multiparameter assays that measure the expression of several tumour genes simultaneously have been developed to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for this breast cancer subtype. The assays provide prognostic information and have been claimed to predict chemotherapy sensitivity. There is a dearth of prospective validation studies. The Optimal Personalised Treatment of early breast cancer usIng Multiparameter Analysis preliminary study (OPTIMA prelim) is the feasibility phase of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to validate the use of multiparameter assay directed chemotherapy decisions in the NHS. Objectives: OPTIMA prelim was designed to establish the acceptability to patients and clinicians of randomisation to test-driven treatment assignment compared with usual care and to select an assay for study in the main RCT. Design: Partially blinded RCT with adaptive design. Setting: Thirty-five UK hospitals. Participants: Patients aged \u2265 40 years with surgically treated ER-positive HER2-negative primary breast cancer and with 1-9 involved axillary nodes, or, if node negative, a tumour at least 30 mm in diameter. Interventions: Randomisation between two treatment options. Option 1 was standard care consisting of chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy. In option 2, an Oncotype DX\u00ae test (Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) performed on the resected tumour was used to assign patients either to standard care [if \u2018recurrence score\u2019 (RS) was > 25] or to endocrine therapy alone (if RS was \u2264 25). Patients allocated chemotherapy were blind to their randomisation. Main outcome measures: The pre-specified success criteria were recruitment of 300 patients in no longer than 2 years and, for the final 150 patients, (1) an acceptance rate of at least 40%; (2) recruitment taking no longer than 6 months; and (3) chemotherapy starting within 6 weeks of consent in at least 85% of patients. Results: Between September 2012 and 3 June 2014, 350 patients consented to join OPTIMA prelim and 313 were randomised; the final 150 patients were recruited in 6 months, of whom 92% assigned chemotherapy started treatment within 6 weeks. The acceptance rate for the 750 patients invited to participate was 47%. Twelve out of the 325 patients with data (3.7%, 95% confidence interval 1.7% to 5.8%) were deemed ineligible on central review of receptor status. Interviews with researchers and recordings of potential participant consultations made as part of the integral qualitative recruitment study provided insights into recruitment barriers and led to interventions designed to improve recruitment. Patient information was changed as the result of feedback from three patient focus groups. Additional multiparameter analysis was performed on 302 tumour samples. Although Oncotype DX, MammaPrint\u00ae/BluePrint\u00ae (Agendia Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), Prosigna\u00ae (NanoString Technologies Inc., Seattle, WA, USA), IHC4, IHC4 automated quantitative immunofluorescence (AQUA\u00ae) [NexCourse BreastTM (Genoptix Inc. Carlsbad, CA, USA)] and MammaTyper\u00ae (BioNTech Diagnostics GmbH, Mainz, Germany) categorised comparable numbers of tumours into low-or high-risk groups and/or equivalent molecular subtypes, there was only moderate agreement between tests at an individual tumour level (kappa ranges 0.33-0.60 and 0.39-0.55 for tests providing risks and subtypes, respectively). Health economics modelling showed the value of information to the NHS from further research into multiparameter testing is high irrespective of the test evaluated. Prosigna is currently the highest priority for further study. Conclusions: OPTIMA prelim has achieved its aims of demonstrating that a large UK clinical trial of multiparameter assay-based selection of chemotherapy in hormone-sensitive early breast cancer is feasible. The economic analysis shows that a trial would be economically worthwhile for the NHS. Based on the outcome of the OPTIMA prelim, a large-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiparameter assay-directed chemotherapy decisions in hormone-sensitive HER2-negative early breast would be appropriate to take place in the NHS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Prognosis", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Research Design", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958042982", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"7402952709": {"Name": "Stein R.C.", "AuthorID": "7402952709", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals"}, "7403290304": {"Name": "Dunn J.A.", "AuthorID": "7403290304", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57114108000": {"Name": "Campbell A.F.", "AuthorID": "57114108000", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "56657083700": {"Name": "Marshall A.", "AuthorID": "56657083700", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57214004223": {"Name": "Poole C.", "AuthorID": "57214004223", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7004043268": {"Name": "Stallard N.", "AuthorID": "7004043268", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "36063907600": {"Name": "Bartlett J.M.S.", "AuthorID": "36063907600", "AffiliationID": "60101854", "AffiliationName": "Ontario Institute for Cancer Research"}, "7403693888": {"Name": "Hall P.", "AuthorID": "7403693888", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Health Economics, Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "56229605700": {"Name": "Rooshenas L.", "AuthorID": "56229605700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7201817264": {"Name": "Donovan J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201817264", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55427817400": {"Name": "Morgan A.", "AuthorID": "55427817400", "AffiliationID": "113162838", "AffiliationName": "Independent Cancer Patients\u2019 Voice"}, "7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, King\u2019s College London"}, "7402888874": {"Name": "Cameron D.A.", "AuthorID": "7402888874", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "7101648655": {"Name": "McCabe C.", "AuthorID": "7101648655", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alberta"}, "6603688989": {"Name": "Hughes-Davies L.", "AuthorID": "6603688989", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Centre, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundations Trust"}, "35480217900": {"Name": "Makris A.", "AuthorID": "35480217900", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
