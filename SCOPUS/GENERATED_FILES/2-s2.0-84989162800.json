Development of molecular testing to identify an increasing number of potentially clinically actionable genetic variants, using smaller samples obtained via minimally invasive techniques, is a huge challenge. Tumour heterogeneity and cancer evolution in response to therapy means that repeat biopsies or circulating biomarkers are likely to be increasingly useful to adapt treatment as resistance develops. We highlight some of the current challenges faced in clinical practice for molecular testing of EGFR, ALK, and new biomarkers such as PDL1. Implementation of next generation sequencing platforms for molecular diagnostics in non-small-cell lung cancer is increasingly common, allowing testing of multiple genetic variants from a single sample. The use of next generation sequencing to recruit for molecularly stratified clinical trials is discussed in the context of the UK Stratified Medicine Programme and The UK National Lung Matrix Trial.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mutation", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989162800", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26023290600": {"Name": "Hiley C.T.", "AuthorID": "26023290600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "7005912775": {"Name": "Swanton C.", "AuthorID": "7005912775", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60172353", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57201489814": {"Name": "Le Quesne J.", "AuthorID": "57201489814", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester"}, "6701907274": {"Name": "Santis G.", "AuthorID": "6701907274", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, King's College London"}, "57191362383": {"Name": "Sharpe R.", "AuthorID": "57191362383", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}, "35745893100": {"Name": "de Castro D.G.", "AuthorID": "35745893100", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queens University Belfast"}, "7005254685": {"Name": "Middleton G.", "AuthorID": "7005254685", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}}}
