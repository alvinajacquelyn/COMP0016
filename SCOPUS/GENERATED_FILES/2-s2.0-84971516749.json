Rendering new text in someone's handwriting is difficult because natural handwriting is highly variable, yet follows both intentional and involuntary structure that makes a person's style selfconsistent. The variability means that naive example-based texture synthesis can be conspicuously repetitive. We propose an algorithm that renders a desired input string in an author's handwriting. An annotated sample of the author's handwriting is required; the system is flexible enough that historical documents can usually be used with only a little extra effort. Experiments show that our glyphcentric approach, with learned parameters for spacing, line thickness, and pressure, produces novel images of handwriting that look hand-made to casual observers, even when printed on paper.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Generative models", "Handwriting", "Texture synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Example based", "Generative model", "Hand made", "Handwriting", "Handwriting Styles", "Historical documents", "Input string", "Texture synthesis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971516749", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"7006714305": {"Name": "Haines T.", "AuthorID": "7006714305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}, "35177072300": {"Name": "Aodha O.", "AuthorID": "35177072300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}, "15135206900": {"Name": "Brostow G.", "AuthorID": "15135206900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}}}
