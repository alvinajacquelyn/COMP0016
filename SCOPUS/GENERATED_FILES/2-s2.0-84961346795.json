Methods A cross-sectional evaluation with collection of clinical and laboratory data for children (0-<10 years) and adolescents (10-19 years) attending a public ART program in Harare providing care for pediatric patients since 2004, was conducted. Longitudinal data for each participant was obtained from the clinic based medical record. Results Data from 599 children and adolescents was evaluated. The participants presented to care with low CD4 cell count and CD4%, median baseline CD4% was lower in adolescents compared with children (11.0% vs. 15.0%, p<0.0001). The median age at ART initiation was 8.0 years (IQR 3.0, 12.0); median time on ART was 2.9 years (IQR 1.7, 4.5). On ART, median CD4% improved for all age groups but remained below 25%. Older age (\u2265 5 years) at ART initiation was associated with severe stunting (HAZ <-2: 53.3%vs. 28.4%, p<0.0001). Virologic failure rate was 30.6% and associated with age at ART initiation. In children, nevirapine based ART regimen was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of failure (AOR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 9.1, p = 0.0180). Children (<10y) on ART for \u22654 years had higher failure rates than those on ART for <4 years (39.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.0239). In those initiating ART as adolescents, each additional year in age above 10 years at the time of ART initiation (AOR 0.4 95%CI: 0.1, 0.9, p = 0.0324), and each additional year on ART (AOR 0.4, 95%CI 0.2, 0.9, p = 0.0379) were associated with decreased risk of virologic failure. Drug resistance was evident in 67.6% of sequenced virus isolates. Conclusions During routine programmatic implementation of HIV care for children and adolescents, delayed age at ART initiation has long-Term implications on immunologic recovery, growth and virologic outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nevirapine", "Time Factors", "Treatment Failure", "Viral Load", "Young Adult", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961346795", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6507740607": {"Name": "Makadzange A.T.", "AuthorID": "6507740607", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "7402209193": {"Name": "Walker B.D.", "AuthorID": "7402209193", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard"}, "55556202900": {"Name": "Higgins-Biddle M.", "AuthorID": "55556202900", "AffiliationID": "60023115", "AffiliationName": "John Snow Inc"}, "6506750248": {"Name": "Ojikutu B.O.", "AuthorID": "6506750248", "AffiliationID": "60023115", "AffiliationName": "John Snow Inc"}, "56460301400": {"Name": "Chimukangara B.", "AuthorID": "56460301400", "AffiliationID": "100473601", "AffiliationName": "African Institute of Biomedical Sciences"}, "57188368900": {"Name": "Birri R.", "AuthorID": "57188368900", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "55414109900": {"Name": "Mahlanza T.", "AuthorID": "55414109900", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "56113055000": {"Name": "McHugh G.", "AuthorID": "56113055000", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "24472050900": {"Name": "Van Dijk J.H.", "AuthorID": "24472050900", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "6507678079": {"Name": "Ndhlovu C.E.", "AuthorID": "6507678079", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "36554025300": {"Name": "Bwakura-Dangarembizi M.", "AuthorID": "36554025300", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "7402800738": {"Name": "Gordon M.", "AuthorID": "7402800738", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Program, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Program, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal"}, "6701637612": {"Name": "Masimirembwa C.", "AuthorID": "6701637612", "AffiliationID": "100473601", "AffiliationName": "African Institute of Biomedical Sciences"}, "36689883000": {"Name": "Phelps B.", "AuthorID": "36689883000", "AffiliationID": "60008275", "AffiliationName": "United States Agency for International Development (USAID)"}, "22933843500": {"Name": "Amzel A.", "AuthorID": "22933843500", "AffiliationID": "60008275", "AffiliationName": "United States Agency for International Development (USAID)"}}}
