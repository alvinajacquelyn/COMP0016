Computational models can be used to test these theories and explore new hypotheses; Bowles and Choi [Bowles S, Choi J-K (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(22):8830-8835] have developed one such model. Their model shows the coevolution of farming and farming-friendly property rights, and by including climate variability, replicates the timings for the emergence of these events seen in the archaeological record. Because the processes modeled occurred a long time ago, it can be difficult to justify exact parameter values; hence, we propose a fitting to idealized outcomes (FIO) method to explore the model's parameter space in more detail. We have replicated the model of Bowles and Choi, and used the FIO method to identify complexities and interactions of the model previously unidentified. Our results indicate that the key parameters for the emergence of farming are group structuring, group size, conservatism, and farming-friendly property rights (lending further support to Bowles and Choi's original proposal). We also find that although advantageous, it is not essential that farming productivity be greater than foraging productivity for farming to emerge. In addition, we highlight how model behaviors can be missed when gauging parameter sensitivity via a fix-all-but-one variation approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modeling", "Fitting to idealized outcomes", "Neolithic revolution", "Property rights", "Simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966376454", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57188651229": {"Name": "Gallagher E.", "AuthorID": "57188651229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics, Physics, Engineering in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "8606206600": {"Name": "Thomas M.", "AuthorID": "8606206600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "6602927062": {"Name": "Shennan S.", "AuthorID": "6602927062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
