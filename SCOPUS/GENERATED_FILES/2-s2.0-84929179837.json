Materials and Methods: Longitudinal data came from a French population based birth cohort study (EDEN; N = 1311 mother-child pairs followed from the pregnancy onwards). Inattention-hyperactivity symptoms were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire when participating children were 3 years of age. Potential risk factors were classified in four domains (fetal exposures and child somatic characteristics, child temperament, child neurodevelopmental status, psychosocial environment) and four periods (before pregnancy, prenatal/birth, infancy, toddlerhood). Their role as potential moderator or mediator was tested with path analysis to determine the developmental sequence. Results: A low family socioeconomic status before pregnancy was the main environmental risk factor for inattention-hyperactivity symptoms at 3 years, and its effect occurred via two pathways. The first was a risk pathway, where lower SES was associated with higher maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy; then to higher maternal and child distress and dysregulation in infancy; and in turn to higher levels of inattention-hyperactivity at 3 years. The second was a protective pathway, where higher SES was associated with longer duration of breastfeeding during infancy; then to better child neurodevelopmental status in toddlerhood; and in turn to lower levels of inattention-hyperactivity at 3 years. Discussion: This study identified psychosocial factors at several developmental periods that represent potential targets for preventing the emergence of inattention-hyperactivity symptoms in early childhood.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "France", "Humans", "Hyperkinesis", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Maternal Exposure", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929179837", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57220013187": {"Name": "Foulon S.", "AuthorID": "57220013187", "AffiliationID": "60106306, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U669, University Paris-Descartes and Paris-Sud"}, "7003400734": {"Name": "Falissard B.", "AuthorID": "7003400734", "AffiliationID": "60106306, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U669, University Paris-Descartes and Paris-Sud"}, "7006183959": {"Name": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006183959", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Tomsk State University"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7003712790": {"Name": "Larroque B.", "AuthorID": "7003712790", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR S953"}, "57209026384": {"Name": "Melchior M.", "AuthorID": "57209026384", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60139056", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
