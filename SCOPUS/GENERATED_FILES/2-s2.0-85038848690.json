The construction of efficient particle-assembled photoanode remains a challenge. Here, taking LaTaON2 particle-assembled photoanode as a model, bulk defect control and interface engineering were introduced to reduce the electron-hole recombination. As a result, the solar photocurrent of LaTaON2 achieves 2.1 mA cm\u22122 at 1.6 VRHE after the modification of CoOx, an order of magnitude greater than the previously-reported value of 0.15 mA cm\u22122. This dramatic enhancement is mainly ascribed to increased bulk electrical conductivity, and less back reactions on the conductive substrates, as well as facilitated hole transfer to reaction sites. This study may provide guidelines for the construction of highly efficient particle-assembled photoanode films.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CoOx modification", "Electrical conductivity", "Particle-assembled films", "Solar water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conductive substrates", "CoOx modification", "Electrical conductivity", "Electron-hole recombination", "Interface engineering", "Reaction sites", "Solar water splitting", "Solar-to-hydrogen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038848690", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"56739406400": {"Name": "Huang H.", "AuthorID": "56739406400", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "55468556500": {"Name": "Feng J.", "AuthorID": "55468556500", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "57200035883": {"Name": "Fu H.", "AuthorID": "57200035883", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "57206176011": {"Name": "Fang T.", "AuthorID": "57206176011", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "56740094000": {"Name": "Qian Q.", "AuthorID": "56740094000", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "34979601400": {"Name": "Yan S.", "AuthorID": "34979601400", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "8575534600": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "8575534600", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "7201440214": {"Name": "Zou Z.", "AuthorID": "7201440214", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "55752469200": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "55752469200", "AffiliationID": "60118453, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "13309196100": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "13309196100", "AffiliationID": "60118453, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
