However, their complex kinematics makes their safe telemanipulation in convoluted anatomy a challenging task. Collaborative control schemes, which guide the operator through haptic and visual feedback, can simplify this task and reduce the cognitive burden of the operator. Guaranteeing stable, collision-free robot configurations during manipulation, however, is computationally demanding and, until now, either required long periods of pre-computation time or distributed computing clusters. Furthermore, the operator is often presented with guidance paths which have to be followed approximately. This paper presents a heterogeneous (CPU/GPU) computing approach to enable rapid workspace analysis on a single computer. The method is used in a new navigation scheme that guides the robot operator towards locations of high dexterity or manipulability of the robot. Under this guidance scheme, the user can make informed decisions and maintain full control of the path planning and manipulation processes, with intuitive visual feedback on when the robot's limitations are being reached.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active constraints", "Anatomical constraint", "Collaborative control", "Dexterous workspace", "Informed decision", "Robot configurations", "Telemanipulation", "Workspace analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041963926", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56001386300": {"Name": "Leibrandt K.", "AuthorID": "56001386300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London"}, "55539304100": {"Name": "Yang G.", "AuthorID": "55539304100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
