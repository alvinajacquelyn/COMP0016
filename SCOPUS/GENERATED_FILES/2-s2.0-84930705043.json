Methods A cohort study, conducted in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in England. Electronic health records were analysed for patients aged 40-74 receiving an NHS Health Check between 2010 and 2013. Results There were 65 324 men and 75 032 women receiving a health check. For every 1000 men assessed, there were 205 smokers (95% confidence interval 195-215), 355 (340-369) with hypertension ( \u2265140/90mmHg) and 633 (607-658) with elevated cholesterol ( \u22655 mmol/l). Among 1000 women, there were 161 (151-171) smokers, 247 (238-257) with hypertension and 668 (646-689) with elevated cholesterol. In the 12 months following the check, statins were prescribed to 18% of men and 21% of women with \u226520% cardiovascular risk and antihypertensive drugs to 11% of men and 16% of women with \u226520% cardiovascular risk. Slight reductions in risk factor values were observed in the minority of participants with follow-up values recorded in the 15 months following the check. Conclusions A universal primary prevention programme identifies substantial risk factor burden in a population without known cardiovascular disease. Research is needed to monitor interventions, and intermediate- and long-term outcomes, in those identified at high risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["circulatory disease", "electronic health records", "primary care", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Health Policy", "Health Priorities", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Hypertension", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "National Health Programs", "Primary Prevention", "Public Health Practice", "Quality Indicators, Health Care", "Quality of Health Care", "Risk Assessment", "Smoking", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930705043", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "55618353400": {"Name": "Booth H.", "AuthorID": "55618353400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "35195469600": {"Name": "Dregan A.", "AuthorID": "35195469600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "8575741300": {"Name": "Burgess C.", "AuthorID": "8575741300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "24512680300": {"Name": "McDermott L.", "AuthorID": "24512680300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "7006445136": {"Name": "Gulliford M.", "AuthorID": "7006445136", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "6507398444": {"Name": "Dodhia H.", "AuthorID": "6507398444", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Lambeth-Southwark Public Health"}, "55617926000": {"Name": "Fuller F.", "AuthorID": "55617926000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "London Borough of Lewisham"}, "57199409360": {"Name": "Miller J.", "AuthorID": "57199409360", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "London Borough of Lewisham"}}}
