However, the precise mechanism for this effect is unknown. Here, we have identified the transcription factor Gata2, previously described as an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell function, as an early and direct target gene for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We also report that Gata2 is involved in mediating a significant part of the TGF\u03b2 response in primitive hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, the cell cycle regulator and TGF\u03b2 signaling effector molecule p57 was found to be upregulated as a secondary response to TGF\u03b2. We observed Gata2 binding upstream of the p57 genomic locus, and importantly, loss of Gata2 abolished TGF\u03b2-stimulated induction of p57 as well as the resulting growth arrest of hematopoietic progenitors. Our results connect key molecules involved in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and reveal a functionally relevant network, regulating proliferation of primitive hematopoietic cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57", "GATA2 Transcription Factor", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "HEK293 Cells", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Genetic", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Signal Transduction", "Smad4 Protein", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962052965", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56423508900": {"Name": "Billing M.", "AuthorID": "56423508900", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "53064551100": {"Name": "R\u00f6rby E.", "AuthorID": "53064551100", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "57189813589": {"Name": "Karlsson S.", "AuthorID": "57189813589", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "7202345092": {"Name": "May G.", "AuthorID": "7202345092", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "7003877136": {"Name": "Tipping A.", "AuthorID": "7003877136", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "55605766343": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55605766343", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "7006621281": {"Name": "Enver T.", "AuthorID": "7006621281", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "9233729200": {"Name": "Soneji S.", "AuthorID": "9233729200", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "36237074700": {"Name": "Karlsson G.", "AuthorID": "36237074700", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "7006113676": {"Name": "Salminen M.", "AuthorID": "7006113676", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Biosciences, University of Helsinki"}}}
