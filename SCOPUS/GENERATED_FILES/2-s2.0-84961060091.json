Using the Young Finns Study combined with the Finnish Linked employer-employee data we show that quantities of creatine measured in 1980 prior to labour market entry affect entrepreneurial success as measured by capital income accumulation over the period 1993\u20132010 (in particular for females). However, we do not find evidence that creatine affects the propensity to become an entrepreneur. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on biomarkers and entrepreneurship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Creatine", "Entrepreneurship", "Self-employment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961060091", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57207904834": {"Name": "Rietveld C.", "AuthorID": "57207904834", "AffiliationID": "60016897, 60022265", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus School of Economics and Erasmus University Rotterdam Institute for Behavior and Biology, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "6602891446": {"Name": "B\u00f6ckerman P.", "AuthorID": "6602891446", "AffiliationID": "60007893", "AffiliationName": "Labour Institute for Economic Research and Institute for the Study of Labor"}, "36150269200": {"Name": "Viinikainen J.", "AuthorID": "36150269200", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University School of Business and Economics"}, "6602282172": {"Name": "Pehkonen J.", "AuthorID": "6602282172", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University School of Business and Economics"}, "7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7004828916": {"Name": "Raitakari O.", "AuthorID": "7004828916", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Turku University Hospital"}}}
