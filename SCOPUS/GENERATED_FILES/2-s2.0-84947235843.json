We use a variation of the Living Planet Index method, which is used for measuring global trends in wild vertebrate species abundance. The analysis is based on a database containing 1100 wetland extent time-series records and the method identifies and addresses ecological and biogeographic biases in the dataset. Globally, the natural WET index, excluding human-made wetlands, declined by about 30% on average between 1970 and 2008. Declines varied between regions from about 50% in Europe to about 17% in Oceania over the same period. The WET index fills an important gap in the ecosystem coverage of global biodiversity indicators and can track changes related to a number of current international policy objectives. The same method could be applied to other datasets to create indicators for other ecosystems with incomplete global data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aichi Target", "Biodiversity", "Ecosystem loss", "Indicator", "Ramsar", "Wetland"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947235843", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"56379613700": {"Name": "Dixon M.", "AuthorID": "56379613700", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "56929706400": {"Name": "Walpole M.", "AuthorID": "56929706400", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "7005450508": {"Name": "Loh J.", "AuthorID": "7005450508", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "55657017500": {"Name": "Davidson N.", "AuthorID": "55657017500", "AffiliationID": "115980837", "AffiliationName": null}, "36438203200": {"Name": "Beltrame C.", "AuthorID": "36438203200", "AffiliationID": "60018601", "AffiliationName": "Tour du Valat"}, "56079348600": {"Name": "Freeman R.", "AuthorID": "56079348600", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}}}
