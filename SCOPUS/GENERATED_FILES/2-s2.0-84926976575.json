The aim of the present study was to investigate the validity of a Web-based, self-administered dietary record (DR) tool using protein, K and Na intakes against 24 h urinary biomarkers (24 h U). Of the total participants, 199 adult volunteers (104 men and 95 women, mean age 50\u00b75 (23-83 years)) of the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Study were included in the protocol. They completed three non-consecutive-day DR and two 24 h U on the first and third DR days. Relative differences between reported (DR) and measured (24 h U) intakes were calculated from the log ratio (DR/24 h U) for protein, K and Na intakes: - 14\u00b74,+2\u00b76 and - 2\u00b71 % for men; and - 13\u00b79, - 3\u00b77 and - 8\u00b73 % for women, respectively. The correlations between reported and true intakes were 0\u00b761, 0\u00b778 and 0\u00b747 for men and 0\u00b764, 0\u00b742 and 0\u00b737 for women for protein, K and Na, respectively. Attenuation factors, that represent attenuation of the true diet-disease relationship due to measurement error (a value closer to 1 indicating lower attenuation), ranged from 0\u00b723 (Na, women) to 0\u00b760 (K, men). We showed that the Web-based DR tool used in the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort study performs well in estimating protein and K intakes and fairly well in estimating Na intake. Furthermore, three non-consecutive-day DR appear to be valid for estimating usual intakes of protein and K, although caution is advised regarding the generalisability of these findings to other nutrients and general population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary records", "Internet", "Urinary biomarkers", "Validation studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biological Markers", "Cohort Studies", "Diet", "Diet Records", "Dietary Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nitrogen", "Nutrition Assessment", "Paris", "Potassium", "Potassium, Dietary", "Self Report", "Sodium", "Sodium, Dietary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926976575", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"35798512000": {"Name": "Lassale C.", "AuthorID": "35798512000", "AffiliationID": "115138956", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team, Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "55929832600": {"Name": "Camilleri G.", "AuthorID": "55929832600", "AffiliationID": "115138956", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team, Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "56386887800": {"Name": "Hercberg S.", "AuthorID": "56386887800", "AffiliationID": "60009647, 60008800", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, H\u00f4pital Avicenne, Universit\u00e9 Paris 13"}, "36484310400": {"Name": "Galan P.", "AuthorID": "36484310400", "AffiliationID": "115138956", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team, Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "35573782000": {"Name": "Kesse-Guyot E.", "AuthorID": "35573782000", "AffiliationID": "115138956", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team, Research Center in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "6603767452": {"Name": "Castetbon K.", "AuthorID": "6603767452", "AffiliationID": "113184761", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit, French Institute for Health Surveillance"}, "6603383844": {"Name": "Deschamps V.", "AuthorID": "6603383844", "AffiliationID": "113184761", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit, French Institute for Health Surveillance"}, "35436444600": {"Name": "Vernay M.", "AuthorID": "35436444600", "AffiliationID": "113184761", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit, French Institute for Health Surveillance"}, "7003494763": {"Name": "Laporte F.", "AuthorID": "7003494763", "AffiliationID": "60005851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University Hospital of Grenoble, Grenoble"}, "35971822000": {"Name": "Faure P.", "AuthorID": "35971822000", "AffiliationID": "60104653", "AffiliationName": "University Grenoble Alpes, HP2 Laboratory"}}}
