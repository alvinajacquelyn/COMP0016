KGaA, WeinheimExploring the combination of continuous-flow processes with the boron Lewis acid catalyzed hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones has delivered a robust and generally applicable reaction protocol. Notably this approach permits ready access to high temperatures and pressures and thus allows improved reactivity of substrates that were previously recalcitrant under the traditional approach. Efforts to quench the output from the flow reactor with water showed surprising tolerance leading to the application of continuous-flow systems in multistep imine formation/hydrosilylation processes to generate the corresponding secondary amines from their aldehyde and aniline precursors.
