We exploit a spin-chain representation of the two-channel Kondo model to probe the ground-state block entropy, negativity, tangle, and Schmidt gap, using a density matrix renormalization group approach. In the presence of symmetric coupling to the two channels, we confirm field-theory predictions for the boundary entropy difference ln(gUV/gIR)=ln(2)/2 between the ultraviolet and infrared limits and the leading ln(x)/x impurity correction to the block entropy. The impurity entanglement Simp is shown to scale with the characteristic length \u03be2CK. We show that both the Schmidt gap and the entanglement of the impurity with one of the channels - as measured by the negativity - faithfully serve as order parameters for the impurity quantum phase transition appearing as a function of channel asymmetry, allowing for explicit determination of critical exponents, \u03bd\u22482 and \u03b2\u22480.2. Remarkably, we find the emergence of tripartite entanglement only in the vicinity of the critical channel-symmetric point.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960171883", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36730856200": {"Name": "Alkurtass B.", "AuthorID": "36730856200", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, King Saud University"}, "8958172800": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "8958172800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007036798": {"Name": "Affleck I.", "AuthorID": "7007036798", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia"}, "7005199114": {"Name": "Johannesson H.", "AuthorID": "7005199114", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Gothenburg"}, "56248410100": {"Name": "Sodano P.", "AuthorID": "56248410100", "AffiliationID": "60023857", "AffiliationName": "Departemento de Fis\u00edca Teorica e Experimental, Universidade Federal Do Rio Grande Do Norte"}, "7101709006": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen E.S.", "AuthorID": "7101709006", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, McMaster University"}, "6603952243": {"Name": "Le Hur K.", "AuthorID": "6603952243", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60013425, 60008134, 60005768", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Ecole Polytechnique, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}}}
