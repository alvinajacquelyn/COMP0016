British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Pharmacological Society.Aims: Rituximab is a chimeric IgG-1 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, aiding in the treatment of several conditions including autoimmune diseases. It is not licensed for use in children. This study aimed to quantify the B cell-related pharmacodynamics of rituximab in children with autoimmune disease. Methods: Routine electronic health record data were collected at a large paediatric tertiary hospital in London, UK. Dosing protocols were either 2 \u00d7 750 mg/m2 intravenous infusions of rituximab on days 1 and 15, or 4 \u00d7 375 mg/m2 infusions on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Rituximab pharmacokinetics (PK) were not measured but CD19+ lymphocyte counts were taken before and after rituximab treatment. A dose\u2013response model was constructed describing the life cycle of CD19+ lymphocytes, with rituximab assumed to increase the death rate. Rituximab effect was assumed to decay by first-order kinetics. Results: In total, 258 measurements of CD19+ lymphocyte counts were collected from 39 children with 8 autoimmune diseases. The elimination rate constant (% relative standard error) of rituximab effect decay was 0.036 (22.7%) days\u22121 and CD19+ turnover was 0.02 (41%) days\u22121 corresponding to half-lives of 19 and 35 days respectively. Rituximab increased CD19+ death rate 35-fold, with methotrexate and cyclophosphamide associated with further increases. Simulations suggested that a single infusion of 750 mg/m2 provides similar 6-month suppression of CD19+ lymphocytes to current dosing. Conclusions: Rituximab pharmacodynamics (PD) in paediatric autoimmune diseases has been described. Compared with rituximab alone, the additional effect of methotrexate or cyclophosphamide was statistically significant but small.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autoimmune diseases", "B lymphocytes", "NONMEM", "paediatrics", "pharmacodynamics", "rituximab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antigens, CD19", "Apoptosis", "Autoimmune Diseases", "B-Lymphocytes", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cyclophosphamide", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Half-Life", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Lymphocyte Count", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Models, Biological", "Retrospective Studies", "Rituximab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067663009", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57209417595": {"Name": "Pan S.", "AuthorID": "57209417595", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust"}, "57209420072": {"Name": "Yu H.", "AuthorID": "57209420072", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24757952100": {"Name": "Eleftheriou D.", "AuthorID": "24757952100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209414700": {"Name": "Surti A.", "AuthorID": "57209414700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57201690415": {"Name": "Cheng I.", "AuthorID": "57201690415", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
