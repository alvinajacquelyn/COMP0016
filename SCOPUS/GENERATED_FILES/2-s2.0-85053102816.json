Before the spearhead of activity in the field of hormone action shifts to an analysis of the effects of \u201cprocessing-out\u201d of intervening gene sequences in nuclear RNA transcripts (already the trend has been from translation to transcription and it may well continue to RNA processing and then back to translation and mRNA stability), it is timely to collate current data relevant to our understanding of the action of hormones, both on transcriptional events and on RNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells. Much of the discussion relates to sex steroid action, due to the comparative profusion of the literature on this topic and the author\u2019s predisposition to this field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053102816", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57203834414": {"Name": "Cox R.F.", "AuthorID": "57203834414", "AffiliationID": "106095427", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Enterprises, Inc."}}}
