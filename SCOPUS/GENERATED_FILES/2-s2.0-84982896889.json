CD8 T cell inhibitory molecules are up-regulated in HIV-1 infection and associate with immune dysfunction. We evaluated participants (n = 122) recruited to the SPARTAC randomised clinical trial to determine whether CD8 T cell exhaustion markers PD-1, Lag-3 and Tim-3 were associated with immune activation and disease progression. Expression of PD-1, Tim-3, Lag-3 and CD38 on CD8 T cells from the closest pre-therapy time-point to seroconversion was measured by flow cytometry, and correlated with surrogate markers of HIV-1 disease (HIV-1 plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4 T cell count) and the trial endpoint (time to CD4 count <350 cells/\u03bcl or initiation of antiretroviral therapy). To explore the functional significance of these markers, co-expression of Eomes, T-bet and CD39 was assessed. Expression of PD-1 on CD8 and CD38 CD8 T cells correlated with pVL and CD4 count at baseline, and predicted time to the trial endpoint. Lag-3 expression was associated with pVL but not CD4 count. For all exhaustion markers, expression of CD38 on CD8 T cells increased the strength of associations. In Cox models, progression to the trial endpoint was most marked for PD-1/CD38 co-expressing cells, with evidence for a stronger effect within 12 weeks from confirmed diagnosis of PHI. The effect of PD-1 and Lag-3 expression on CD8 T cells retained statistical significance in Cox proportional hazards models including antiretroviral therapy and CD4 count, but not pVL as co-variants. Expression of \u2018exhaustion\u2019 or \u2018immune checkpoint\u2019 markers in early HIV-1 infection is associated with clinical progression and is impacted by immune activation and the duration of infection. New markers to identify exhausted T cells and novel interventions to reverse exhaustion may inform the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antigens, CD", "Biomarkers", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982896889", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57199660430": {"Name": "Hoffmann M.", "AuthorID": "57199660430", "AffiliationID": "60022646", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, Kantonsspital"}, "7404679392": {"Name": "Martin G.E.", "AuthorID": "7404679392", "AffiliationID": "60008936", "AffiliationName": "Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine"}, "35198137200": {"Name": "Hickling S.", "AuthorID": "35198137200", "AffiliationID": "60008936", "AffiliationName": "Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine"}, "46062034600": {"Name": "Hurst J.", "AuthorID": "46062034600", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "The Oxford Martin School"}, "57086618400": {"Name": "Meyerowitz J.", "AuthorID": "57086618400", "AffiliationID": "60008936", "AffiliationName": "Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine"}, "16551473800": {"Name": "Willberg C.B.", "AuthorID": "16551473800", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56542553200": {"Name": "Robinson N.", "AuthorID": "56542553200", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "9042788600": {"Name": "Brown H.", "AuthorID": "9042788600", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7404240980": {"Name": "Phillips R.", "AuthorID": "7404240980", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "35573097200": {"Name": "Frater J.", "AuthorID": "35573097200", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7004148119": {"Name": "Pantazis N.", "AuthorID": "7004148119", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology"}, "7004544555": {"Name": "Babiker A.", "AuthorID": "7004544555", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology"}, "57203665899": {"Name": "Fisher M.", "AuthorID": "57203665899", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals"}, "57195753144": {"Name": "Kinloch S.", "AuthorID": "57195753144", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7404322878": {"Name": "Weber J.", "AuthorID": "7404322878", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wright Fleming Institute, Imperial College"}, "57201568964": {"Name": "Fidler S.", "AuthorID": "57201568964", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wright Fleming Institute, Imperial College"}, "6603863070": {"Name": "Nwokolo N.", "AuthorID": "6603863070", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "35581226900": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "35581226900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary Medicine and Infectious Disease, Guys and St Thomas' NHS Trust"}}}
