While diverse and hard to categorize, these communities are highly cohesive and members have a strong sense of identity as a group apart from the majority population. Researchers commonly experience challenges in accessing, recruiting, and retaining research participants from these communities, linked to their outsider status, insular nature, and history of discrimination. In this article, the challenges and the opportunities of engaging Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers in a multicenter qualitative research project are discussed. The management of public involvement and community engagement in this U.K.-based project provides insights into conducting research effectively with ethnically and linguistically diverse communities, often considered to be \u201chard to reach.\u201d.", "AuthorKeywords": ["engagement", "Gypsies", "public involvement", "qualitative interviews", "qualitative research", "research methods", "Roma", "travellers", "United Kingdom", "vulnerable groups"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Community-Based Participatory Research", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Selection", "Politics", "Qualitative Research", "Research Design", "Roma", "Transients and Migrants", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059644506", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6602184680": {"Name": "Condon L.", "AuthorID": "6602184680", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Swansea University"}, "7004859466": {"Name": "Bedford H.", "AuthorID": "7004859466", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57191519747": {"Name": "Ireland L.", "AuthorID": "57191519747", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "7102711611": {"Name": "Kerr S.", "AuthorID": "7102711611", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "6506991413": {"Name": "Mytton J.", "AuthorID": "6506991413", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "57191520022": {"Name": "Richardson Z.", "AuthorID": "57191520022", "AffiliationID": "109727925", "AffiliationName": "NHS Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group"}, "55057754400": {"Name": "Jackson C.", "AuthorID": "55057754400", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "University of York"}}}
