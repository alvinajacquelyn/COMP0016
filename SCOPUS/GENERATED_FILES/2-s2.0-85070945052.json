We describe 4 patients with acral CMN with a \u201cbiker-glove\u201d distribution with sparing of the distal digits, as has previously been described in acral infantile hemangiomas (IH). The existence of the biker-glove pattern suggests that CMN arise from early mutations in melanocyte precursors and supports the recently described Kinsler-Larue hypothesis of mesenchymal distribution of melanocyte migration occurring in a circular field from a central point. Developmental errors in mesenchymal precursors with similar migration patterns may explain this shared pattern among CMN and IH.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Hand", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nevus, Pigmented", "Skin Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070945052", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"57195740693": {"Name": "Kittler N.W.", "AuthorID": "57195740693", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "6603530443": {"Name": "Mathes E.F.", "AuthorID": "6603530443", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "7007050346": {"Name": "Frieden I.J.", "AuthorID": "7007050346", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "6506836269": {"Name": "Kinsler V.", "AuthorID": "6506836269", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dermatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
