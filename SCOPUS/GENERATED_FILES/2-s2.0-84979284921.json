In this article, typical audiological assessment and management of an older adult is contrasted with a best practice approach wherein the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework is applied. The aim of the comparison is to demonstrate how the ICF expands our focus: rather than merely focusing on impairment, we also consider the activities, participation, and contextual factors for both the person with the hearing impairment and his or her family. A case example of an older patient and her spouse is provided, and their shared experience of the patient's hearing impairment is mapped onto the ICF framework. Family-centered hearing care is recommended for individualizing care and improving outcomes for older patients and their families.", "AuthorKeywords": ["audiological rehabilitation", "family-centered care", "hearing aids", "ICF", "older adults", "Patient-centered care", "third-party disability", "WHO"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979284921", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"56039137700": {"Name": "Grenness C.", "AuthorID": "56039137700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, University of Melbourne"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "13608802400": {"Name": "Scarinci N.", "AuthorID": "13608802400", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "55641225100": {"Name": "Ekberg K.", "AuthorID": "55641225100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "7004043266": {"Name": "Hickson L.", "AuthorID": "7004043266", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}}}
