An entire array, given identical elements, can be emulated using a single device-under-test. The method is demonstrated and verified by studying two scenarios, where the resulting adjacent channel power ratio and error-vector magnitude are given as function of delay and coupling for a 6W GaN power amplifier. Differences in adjacent channel power ratio and error-vector magnitude can be attributed to time-variant load impedances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5G mobile communication", "Arrays", "Coupling", "Distortion", "Load-pull", "Power amplifiers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjacent channel power ratio", "Arrays", "Device under test", "Error vector magnitude", "GaN power amplifier", "Load pull", "Mobile communications", "Time variant impedances"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032462262", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55773261300": {"Name": "Nopchinda D.", "AuthorID": "55773261300", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology"}, "14821875800": {"Name": "Buisman K.", "AuthorID": "14821875800", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
