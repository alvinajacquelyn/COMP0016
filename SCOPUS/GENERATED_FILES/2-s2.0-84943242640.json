We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of clinical and laboratory markers associated with the risk of developing active TB in contacts with latent M. tuberculosis infection. HIV-negative household contacts (n=296) of pulmonary TB patients underwent monitoring of clinical features, full blood cell counts, tuberculin skin text (TST) and chest radiography performed regularly during 18 months of follow-up. Paired statistical tests, a Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard modelling were performed on variables between contacts progressing or not progressing to active TB. The appearance of TB disease symptoms in contacts was significantly associated with an elevated peripheral percentage of blood monocytes (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 6.25, 95% CI 1.63-23.95; p<0.01), a \u226514 mm TST response (aHR 5.72, 95% CI 1.22-26.80; p=0.03) and an increased monocyte:lymphocyte ratio (aHR 4.97, 95% CI 1.3-18.99; p=0.03). Among contacts having TST \u226514 mm, a strong association with risk of progression to TB was found with an elevated blood monocyte percentage (aHR 8.46, 95% CI 1.74-41.22; p<0.01). Elevated percentage of peripheral blood monocytes plus an elevated TST response are potential biomarkers for identifying contacts of TB patients at highest risk of developing active TB.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Blood Cell Count", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Contact Tracing", "Disease Progression", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Lymphocytes", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Skin Tests", "Tuberculin", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943242640", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"36162028500": {"Name": "Rakotosamimanana N.", "AuthorID": "36162028500", "AffiliationID": "60072611", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 des Mycobact\u00e9ries, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar"}, "18438361800": {"Name": "Razanamparany V.R.", "AuthorID": "18438361800", "AffiliationID": "60072611", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 des Mycobact\u00e9ries, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar"}, "35074901800": {"Name": "Richard V.", "AuthorID": "35074901800", "AffiliationID": "60071556", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 D'Epid\u00e9miologie, Institut Pasteur de Dakar"}, "24072016000": {"Name": "Raharimanga V.", "AuthorID": "24072016000", "AffiliationID": "60071556", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 D'Epid\u00e9miologie, Institut Pasteur de Dakar"}, "18934359400": {"Name": "Gicquel B.", "AuthorID": "18934359400", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mycobact\u00e9rienne, Institut Pasteur Paris"}, "56890842200": {"Name": "Doherty T.M.", "AuthorID": "56890842200", "AffiliationID": "60111453", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60072805, 60072796", "AffiliationName": "University of Zambia-University College London Medical School (UNZA-UCLMS), Research and Training Project, University Teaching Hospital"}}}
