Methods National data on four pediatric laparoscopic operations (appendectomy, pyloromyotomy, cholecystectomy, splenectomy) were analyzed using the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Database (2002-2013). The highest level of evidence to support the use of each procedure was identified from Cochrane, Embase, and Pubmed databases. Chi-square test for trend was used to determine significance and time to plateau. Results There were 28,843 operations (open: 12,048; laparoscopic: 16,795). Use of laparoscopic procedures increased over time (p < 0.0001). A plateau was reached for cholecystectomy (2006), splenectomy (2007), and appendectomy (2012), but not for pyloromyotomy. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy in 2013 remains less diffused than the other procedures (p < 0.0001). Laparoscopic appendectomy and pyloromyotomy are supported by level-1a evidence in children, whereas cholecystectomy and splenectomy are supported by level-1a evidence in adults but level-3 in children. Conclusions In Canada, it has taken a long time to reach high-level implementation of laparoscopic surgery in children. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy first reached plateau, whereas laparoscopic pyloromyotomy continues to increase but remains low despite high level of evidence in support of its usage compared to open surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Appendicitis", "Children", "Cholecystectomy", "Laparoscopy", "Minimally invasive surgery", "Pediatric surgery", "Pyloromyotomy", "Splenectomy", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Appendectomy", "Canada", "Child", "Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Pylorus", "Retrospective Studies", "Splenectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961231184", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57185607700": {"Name": "Sattarova V.", "AuthorID": "57185607700", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "37026275600": {"Name": "Lapidus-Krol E.", "AuthorID": "37026275600", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7003624486": {"Name": "Zani A.", "AuthorID": "7003624486", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7201554532": {"Name": "Hall N.J.", "AuthorID": "7201554532", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}}}
