QENS experiments observed jump diffusion with a jump distance of 3 \u00c5, giving similar self-diffusion coefficient measurements for both Cu- and H-CHA samples, in the range of ca. 5-10 \u00d7 10-10 m2 s-1 over the measured temperature range. Self-diffusivities calculated by MD were within a factor of 6 of those measured experimentally at each temperature. The activation energies of diffusion were also similar for both studied systems: 3.7 and 4.4 kJ mol-1 for the H- and Cu-chabazite respectively, suggesting that counterion presence has little impact on ammonia diffusivity on the timescale of the QENS experiment. An explanation is given by the MD simulations, which showed the strong coordination of NH3 with Cu2+ counterions in the centre of the chabazite cage, shielding other molecules from interaction with the ion, and allowing for intercage diffusion through the 8-ring windows (consistent with the experimentally observed jump length) to carry on unhindered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976863950", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55913822400": {"Name": "O'Malley A.J.", "AuthorID": "55913822400", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "54419832100": {"Name": "Collier P.J.", "AuthorID": "54419832100", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "36615561000": {"Name": "Hitchcock I.", "AuthorID": "36615561000", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "56954487600": {"Name": "Sarwar M.", "AuthorID": "56954487600", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57190048922": {"Name": "Hindocha S.", "AuthorID": "57190048922", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57197469976": {"Name": "York A.P.E.", "AuthorID": "57197469976", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "15073619700": {"Name": "Silverwood I.P.", "AuthorID": "15073619700", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
