A paint micro-sample from Rembrandt's Homer was imaged using X-ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD-CT) in order to understand the evolving solid-state Pb chemistry from the painting surface and beneath. The surface crust was identified as a complex mixture of lead sulfates. From the S : Pb ratios throughout the paint layer, we can conclude that S is from an external source in the form of SO2, and that the nature of Pb-SO4 product is dependent on the degree of diffusion/absorption of SO2 into the paint layers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061157260", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7202475272": {"Name": "Price S.W.T.", "AuthorID": "7202475272", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "50462225500": {"Name": "Parsons A.D.", "AuthorID": "50462225500", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "49561623900": {"Name": "Murray C.", "AuthorID": "49561623900", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7003565868": {"Name": "Mosselmans J.F.W.", "AuthorID": "7003565868", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56343395700": {"Name": "Van Loon A.", "AuthorID": "56343395700", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Van't Hoff Institute for Molecular Science, University of Amsterdam"}, "6508142128": {"Name": "Keune K.", "AuthorID": "6508142128", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Van't Hoff Institute for Molecular Science, University of Amsterdam"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
