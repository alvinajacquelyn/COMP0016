The adequacy of the World Health Organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) antimicrobial guidelines for the treatment of suspected severe bacterial infections is dependent on a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We describe trends in etiologies and susceptibility patterns of bloodstream infections (BSI) in hospitalized children in Malawi. Methods. We determined the change in the population-based incidence of BSI in children admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi (1998-2017). AMR profiles were assessed by the disc diffusion method, and trends over time were evaluated. Results. A total 89 643 pediatric blood cultures were performed, and 10 621 pathogens were included in the analysis. Estimated minimum incidence rates of BSI for those \u22645 years of age fell from a peak of 11.4 per 1000 persons in 2002 to 3.4 per 1000 persons in 2017. Over 2 decades, the resistance of Gram-negative pathogens to all empiric, first-line antimicrobials (ampicillin/penicillin, gentamicin, ceftriaxone) among children \u22645 years increased from 3.4% to 30.2% (P < .001). Among those \u226460 days, AMR to all first-line antimicrobials increased from 7.0% to 67.7% (P < .001). Among children \u22645 years, Klebsiella spp. resistance to all first-line antimicrobial regimens increased from 5.9% to 93.7% (P < .001). Conclusions. The incidence of BSI among hospitalized children has decreased substantially over the last 20 years, although gains have been offset by increases in Gram-negative pathogens' resistance to all empiric first-line antimicrobials. There is an urgent need to address the broader challenge of adapting IMCI guidelines to the local setting in the face of rapidly-expanding AMR in childhood BSI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial resistance", "Gram negative", "Neonatal", "Pediatric", "Sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteremia", "Blood Culture", "Child, Preschool", "Cross Infection", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections", "Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Malawi", "Prevalence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068391917", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56544539800": {"Name": "Tam P.Y.I.", "AuthorID": "56544539800", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "57192175092": {"Name": "Musicha P.", "AuthorID": "57192175092", "AffiliationID": "60175823", "AffiliationName": "Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"}, "38662303900": {"Name": "Cornick J.", "AuthorID": "38662303900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "37074350500": {"Name": "Denis B.", "AuthorID": "37074350500", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "57212620629": {"Name": "Freyne B.", "AuthorID": "57212620629", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "19933714900": {"Name": "Everett D.", "AuthorID": "19933714900", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "34975060700": {"Name": "French N.", "AuthorID": "34975060700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "36479968900": {"Name": "Feasey N.", "AuthorID": "36479968900", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35801123300": {"Name": "Kawaza K.", "AuthorID": "35801123300", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "55249992000": {"Name": "Dube Q.", "AuthorID": "55249992000", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}}}
