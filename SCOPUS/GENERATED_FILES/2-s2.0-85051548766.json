In cases of high-dimensional datasets with limited number of examples (e.g. neuroimaging data) there is a need for regularisation to enable the solution of the ill-posed problem and prevent overfitting. Different approaches have been proposed to optimise the regularisation parameters in unsupervised models, however, so far, there has been no comparison between the different approaches using the same data. In this work, two optimisation frameworks (i.e. a permutation and a train/test framework) were compared using sparse PLS to investigate associations between brain connectivity and behaviour data. Both frameworks were able to identify at least one brain-behaviour associative effect. A second brain-behaviour effect was only found using the train/test framework. More importantly, the results show that the multivariate associative effects found with the train/test framework generalise better to new data, suggesting that results based on the permutation framework should be carefully interpreted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain-behaviour", "High-dimensionality", "Regularisation", "Sparse PLS", "Tuning parameters"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain connectivity", "High dimensional datasets", "High dimensionality", "Ill posed problem", "Partial least square (PLS)", "Regularisation", "Sparse PLS", "Tuning parameter"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051548766", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"57203395314": {"Name": "Ferreira F.", "AuthorID": "57203395314", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "34882137100": {"Name": "Rosa M.", "AuthorID": "34882137100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "57203998200": {"Name": "Mourao-Miranda J.", "AuthorID": "57203998200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "7003290763": {"Name": "Shawe-Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7003290763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6603657495": {"Name": "Moutoussis M.", "AuthorID": "6603657495", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7004536701": {"Name": "Ashburner J.", "AuthorID": "7004536701", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
