Discrete acoustic sources were sequentially addressed by scanning a focussed optical beam across the proximal end of a coherent fibre bundle; high-frequency ultrasound (156% fractional bandwidth centred around 13.5 MHz) was generated photoacoustically in the corresponding regions of an optically absorbing coating deposited at the distal end. Paired with a single fibre-optic ultrasound detector, the imaging probe (3.5 mm outer diameter) achieved high on-axis resolutions of 97 \u03bcm, 179 \u03bcm and 110 \u03bcm in the x, y and z directions, respectively. Furthermore, the optical scan pattern, and thus the acoustic source array geometry, was readily reconfigured. Implementing four different array geometries revealed a strong dependency of the image quality on the source location pattern. Thus, by employing optical technology, a miniature ultrasound probe was fabricated that allows for arbitrary source array geometries, which is suitable for three-dimensional endoscopic and laparoscopic imaging, as was demonstrated on ex vivo porcine cardiac tissue.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Endosonography", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Optical Imaging", "Photoacoustic Techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018949275", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24922600100": {"Name": "Alles E.", "AuthorID": "24922600100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194164720": {"Name": "Fook Sheung N.", "AuthorID": "57194164720", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, UCL Department of Chemistry"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
