Employing a single case study research design, we collected and analyzed rich and detailed information from documentation, archival data, and in-depth semistructured interviews with very experienced project managers of a Chinese construction firm. Our findings advance extant research on how the interplay between corporate-level organizational culture and cultural elements at lower organizational levels influences individual choices on (1) which types of knowledge are most important to transfer, (2) under which conditions knowledge may be shared or hoarded, and (3) the extent to which it is acceptable to share or hoard knowledge. The study also contributes to the literature on the legitimacy of knowledge by showing how organizational culture influences people's perceptions of \u201cknowledge authority\u201d and shapes their preferences for specific knowledge transfer mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Knowledge management", "Knowledge transfer", "Organizational culture", "Project-based organizations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Case study research", "Empirical investigation", "Knowledge transfer", "Organizational cultures", "Organizational levels", "Project-based organizations", "Semi structured interviews", "Transfer of knowledge"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014314106", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57193505164": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "57193505164", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "47061677800": {"Name": "Miraglia S.", "AuthorID": "47061677800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
