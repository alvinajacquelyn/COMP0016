This may be considered a paradigm of the ground work needed to tackle the molecular basis of all the protein-aggregation-related diseases. With this aim, we used chemical and physical dissociation methods to explore the structural organization of wild-type aS fibrils. High pressure (in the kbar range) and alkaline pH were used to disassemble fibrils to collect information on the hierarchic pathway by which distinct \u03b2-sheets sequentially unfold using the unique possibility offered by high-pressure Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results point toward the formation of kinetic traps in the energy landscape of aS fibril disassembly and the presence of transient partially folded species during the process. Since we found that the dissociation of wild-type aS fibrils by high pressure is reversible upon pressure release, the disassembled molecules likely retain structural information that favors fibril reformation. To deconstruct the role of the different regions of aS sequence in this process, we measured the high-pressure dissociation of amyloids formed by covalent chimeric dimers of aS (syn-syn) and by the aS deletion mutant that lacks the C-terminus, i.e., aS (1\u201399). The results allowed us to single out the role of dimerization and that of the C-terminus in the complete maturation of fibrillar aS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Amyloid", "Circular Dichroism", "Escherichia coli", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Pressure", "Protein Conformation, beta-Strand", "Protein Domains", "Protein Folding", "Protein Multimerization", "Recombinant Proteins", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031504466", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"]], "AuthorData": {"36017233800": {"Name": "Piccirilli F.", "AuthorID": "36017233800", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University of Trieste"}, "26643498200": {"Name": "Lupi S.", "AuthorID": "26643498200", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica Universit\u00e0 di Roma \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d"}, "55330525100": {"Name": "Plotegher N.", "AuthorID": "55330525100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "11739658800": {"Name": "Ortore M.", "AuthorID": "11739658800", "AffiliationID": "60031624", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Marche Polytechnic University"}, "35509162800": {"Name": "Mariani P.", "AuthorID": "35509162800", "AffiliationID": "60031624", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Marche Polytechnic University"}, "7005534298": {"Name": "Spinozzi F.", "AuthorID": "7005534298", "AffiliationID": "60031624", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"}, "6504058481": {"Name": "Tessari I.", "AuthorID": "6504058481", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "7004495260": {"Name": "Beltramini M.", "AuthorID": "7004495260", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "6701737219": {"Name": "Bubacco L.", "AuthorID": "6701737219", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "8201510100": {"Name": "Brucale M.", "AuthorID": "8201510100", "AffiliationID": "60008737", "AffiliationName": "CNR-ISMN"}, "6601985291": {"Name": "Militello V.", "AuthorID": "6601985291", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of Palermo"}, "6603071452": {"Name": "Perucchi A.", "AuthorID": "6603071452", "AffiliationID": "60033292", "AffiliationName": "Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A."}}}
