For aerospace applications they offer a number of advantages including a good strength to weight ratio. However, impact during the operation and servicing of the aircraft can lead to barely visible and difficult to detect damage. Depending on the severity of the impact, fiber and matrix breakage or delaminations can occur, reducing the load carrying capacity of the structure. Efficient nondestructive testing of composite panels can be achieved using guided ultrasonic waves propagating along the structure. The guided wave propagation in intact composite plates was measured using a noncontact laser interferometer, quantified, and compared to numerical predictions using full three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element (FE) simulations. Good agreement between experiments and predictions for the wave propagation was found. The guided wave scattering at delaminations was simulated using 3D FE models and the influence of the delamination modelling investigated. Limited influence of the material damping and the delamination shape on the scattering patterns was found, but the modelling of the specimen anisotropy was observed to have a significant influence. The effects of the delamination size and depth on the guided wave scattering were investigated in a systematic parametric study, in order to help building up information for an accurate interpretation of guided wave experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984574970", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55756162400": {"Name": "Murat B.", "AuthorID": "55756162400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56196513300": {"Name": "Khalili P.", "AuthorID": "56196513300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23977809500": {"Name": "Fromme P.", "AuthorID": "23977809500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
