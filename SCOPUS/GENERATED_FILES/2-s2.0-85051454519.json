However, the severity of communication problems does not explain their victimization rates. In children without DLD, difficulties with emotional competence are a risk factor for victimization and also increase the risk of bullying. In this longitudinal study, we examined the extent to which the level and development of emotional competence (understanding of one\u2019s own emotions and levels of anger, sadness, and fear) contributed to the prediction of victimization and bullying in children with and without DLD, over and above the type and severity of communication problems of children with DLD. Method: Clinically referred youngsters (8\u201316 years old) with (n = 112; 48% girls, 52% boys) and without (n = 233; 58% girls, 42% boys) DLD completed self-reports 3 times over an 18-month period. Parents of children with DLD reported on their children\u2019s communication problems. Results: Participants with DLD reported more victimization but comparable levels of bullying behavior compared with peers without DLD. Higher levels of sadness and fear were risk factors for more victimization in both groups. Better understanding of one\u2019s own emotions had a larger effect on less victimization in children with DLD, independent of their communication problems. In addition, increased levels of anger and lower levels of understanding of one\u2019s own emotions explained more bullying in both groups. Conclusion: Outcomes indicate that secondary difficulties in emotional competence in children with DLD make these children more vulnerable to victimization and warrant specific support and interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bullying", "Child", "Crime Victims", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development Disorders", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Competency", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051454519", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57203396524": {"Name": "van den Bedem N.P.", "AuthorID": "57203396524", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Psychology, Leiden University"}, "6603039339": {"Name": "Rieffe C.", "AuthorID": "6603039339", "AffiliationID": "101796853", "AffiliationName": "Nederlandse Stichting voor het Dove en Slechthorende Kind"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6701709677": {"Name": "van Alphen P.M.", "AuthorID": "6701709677", "AffiliationID": "60118611", "AffiliationName": "Royal Dutch Kentalis, Sint-Michielsgestel"}, "57203389786": {"Name": "Kalicharan S.V.", "AuthorID": "57203389786", "AffiliationID": "60118611", "AffiliationName": "Royal Dutch Kentalis, Sint-Michielsgestel"}}}
