Laxatives are commonly used to treat opioid-induced constipation, the commonest and most bothersome complication of opioids. However, laxatives have a nonspecific action and do not target underlying mechanisms of opioidinduced constipation; their use is associated with abdominal symptoms that negatively impact quality of life. Objective. To assess the effects of laxatives in patients taking opioids for chronic pain. Methods. One hundred ninety-eight UK patients who had taken opioid analgesics for at least one month completed a cross-sectional online or telephone survey. Questions addressed their pain condition, medication, and laxative use (including efficacy and side effects). The survey also assessed bowel function using the Bowel Function Index. Results. Since starting their current opioid, 134 of 184 patients (73%) had used laxatives at some point and 122 (91%) of these were currently taking them. The most common laxatives were osmotics and stimulants. Laxative side effects were reported in 75%, most commonly gas, bloating/fullness, and a sudden urge to defecate. Side effects were more common in patients less than 40 years of age. Approximately half of patients said laxatives interfered with work and social activities, and one-fifth needed an overnight hospital stay because of their pain condition and/or constipation. Laxatives did not improve the symptoms of constipation, as assessed by the Bowel Function Index. Constipation was not related to opioid strength, dose of opioid, or number of laxatives taken. Conclusions. Use of laxatives to treat opioid-induced constipation is often ineffective and associated with side effects. Instead of relieving the burden of opioidinduced constipation, laxative use is associated with a negative impact.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bowel function index", "Chronic pain", "Laxatives", "Opioid", "Opioid-induced constipation", "Survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Chronic Pain", "Constipation", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Laxatives", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037593646", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College Hospital"}, "57216199517": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "57216199517", "AffiliationID": "119885294", "AffiliationName": "Chronic Pain Policy Coalition (CPPC) Policy Connect, CAN Mezzanine"}, "57189759861": {"Name": "McSkimming P.", "AuthorID": "57189759861", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "56478568600": {"Name": "Dickerson S.", "AuthorID": "56478568600", "AffiliationID": "112741305", "AffiliationName": "Mundipharma International Limited"}}}
