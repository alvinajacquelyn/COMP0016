Yet, these combined properties are important for therapeutic efficacy. To bioengineer capsids that exhibit both unique seroreactivity profiles and functionally transduce human hepatocytes at therapeutically relevant levels, we performed multiplexed sequential directed evolution screens using diverse capsid libraries in both primary human hepatocytes in vivo and with pooled human sera from thousands of patients. AAV libraries were subjected to five rounds of in vivo selection in xenografted mice with human livers to isolate an enriched human-hepatotropic library that was then used as input for a sequential on-bead screen against pooled human immunoglobulins. Evolved variants were vectorized and validated against existing hepatotropic serotypes. Two of the evolved AAV serotypes, NP40 and NP59, exhibited dramatically improved functional human hepatocyte transduction in vivo in xenografted mice with human livers, along with favorable human seroreactivity profiles, compared with existing serotypes. These novel capsids represent enhanced vector delivery systems for future human liver gene therapy applications. Paulk et al. performed sequential directed evolution screens of AAV capsid libraries in primary human hepatocytes in vivo and against human sera from thousands of patients. Resultant capsid variants AAV-NP40, AAV-NP59, and AAV-NP84 exhibit unique seroreactivity and significantly increase functional human hepatocyte transduction in vivo compared to existing hepatotropic serotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AAV", "evolution", "hepatocyte", "human", "library", "liver", "neutralization", "screen", "transduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Capsid Proteins", "Dependovirus", "Female", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Vectors", "Hepatocytes", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031746439", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"18438045900": {"Name": "Paulk N.K.", "AuthorID": "18438045900", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "7801505183": {"Name": "Pekrun K.", "AuthorID": "7801505183", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "57201874801": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "57201874801", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "55647495100": {"Name": "Chu K.", "AuthorID": "55647495100", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "57218470640": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57218470640", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "55495283400": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "55495283400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "7202188427": {"Name": "Kay M.A.", "AuthorID": "7202188427", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "23767680900": {"Name": "Zhu E.", "AuthorID": "23767680900", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, University of Sydney"}, "7103382748": {"Name": "Alexander I.E.", "AuthorID": "7103382748", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, University of Sydney"}, "57208461286": {"Name": "Lisowski L.", "AuthorID": "57208461286", "AffiliationID": "100353480", "AffiliationName": "Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (MIHE)"}, "56959160100": {"Name": "Nygaard S.", "AuthorID": "56959160100", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "55698691300": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "55698691300", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "55326032700": {"Name": "Haft A.", "AuthorID": "55326032700", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "7005886994": {"Name": "Grompe M.", "AuthorID": "7005886994", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "6603246104": {"Name": "Leborgne C.", "AuthorID": "6603246104", "AffiliationID": "60106981, 60000905, 60006105", "AffiliationName": "Genethon and INSERM U951"}, "6603473232": {"Name": "Mingozzi F.", "AuthorID": "6603473232", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "University Pierre and Marie Curie"}, "7003346136": {"Name": "Dane A.P.", "AuthorID": "7003346136", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.C.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "National Health Services Blood and Transplant"}, "35509616900": {"Name": "Morton C.", "AuthorID": "35509616900", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "7006576814": {"Name": "Davidoff A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006576814", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "35420420900": {"Name": "Valentine M.B.", "AuthorID": "35420420900", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Cytogenetic Shared Resource, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}}
