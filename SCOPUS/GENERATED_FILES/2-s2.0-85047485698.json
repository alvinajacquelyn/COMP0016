Our strategy is to elicit women's willingness to pay to receive a cash transfer instead of their spouse receiving it. We selected participants from a sample of women who had already participated in a policy intervention in Macedonia offering poor households cash transfers conditional on having their children attending secondary school. The programme randomised transfers at the municipality level to either household heads (generally a male) or mothers. We show that women who were offered the transfer on average have stronger measured empowerment. Here, IV estimation confirms this result.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047485698", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"25635295900": {"Name": "Alm\u00e5s I.", "AuthorID": "25635295900", "AffiliationID": "60025233", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian School of Economics"}, "57192816615": {"Name": "Armand A.", "AuthorID": "57192816615", "AffiliationID": "60033320", "AffiliationName": "University of Navarra and Navarra Centre for International Development"}, "6603862452": {"Name": "Attanasio O.", "AuthorID": "6603862452", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012327", "AffiliationName": "University College London and IFS"}, "36950364900": {"Name": "Carneiro P.", "AuthorID": "36950364900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012327, 60117041", "AffiliationName": "University College London, IFS and NBER, and Cemmap"}}}
