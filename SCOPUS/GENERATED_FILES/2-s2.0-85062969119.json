We have verified the existence of a second Dirac surface state in Bi2Se3 and qualitatively located it by properly analyzing the traces acquired at different probe wavelengths. Referring to the band structure of Bi2Se3, the relaxation mechanisms for photo-excited electrons with different energies are also revealed and studied. Our results show a second rise of the transient reflection signal at the time scale of several picoseconds. The types of substrate can also significantly affect the dynamics of the rising signal. This phenomenon is attributed to the effect of lattice heating and coherent phonon processes. The mechanism study in this work will benefit the fabrication of high-performance photonic devices based on topological insulators.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coherent phonons", "Different substrates", "Electron phonon couplings", "Mechanism studies", "Photoexcited electrons", "Relaxation mechanism", "Transient reflectivity", "Various substrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062969119", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Center of Quantum Information, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57205134193": {"Name": "Miao R.", "AuthorID": "57205134193", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57194639589": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57194639589", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55598164400": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "55598164400", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57190745721": {"Name": "Wei K.", "AuthorID": "57190745721", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57200242626": {"Name": "Zhou T.", "AuthorID": "57200242626", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Defense Technology Innovation, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Defense Technology Innovation, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "57221406260": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57221406260", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Defense Technology Innovation, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}}}
