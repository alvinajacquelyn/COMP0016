Here we use glutamate uncaging and a novel optogenetic strategy to track changes in the afferent and efferent synaptic connections of developing neocortical interneuron subtypes. We find that Nkx2-1-derived interneurons possess functional synaptic connections before emerging pyramidal cell networks. Subsequent interneuron circuit maturation is both subtype and layer dependent. Glutamatergic input onto fast spiking (FS), but not somatostatin-positive, non-FS interneurons increases over development. Interneurons of both subtype located in layers (L) 4 and 5b engage in transient circuits that disappear after the somatosensory critical period. These include a pathway mediated by L5b somatostatin-positive interneurons that specifically targets L4 during the first postnatal week. The innervation patterns of immature cortical interneuron circuits are thus neither static nor progressively strengthened but follow a layer-specific choreography of transient connections that differ from those of the adult brain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Cluster Analysis", "GABAergic Neurons", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "Interneurons", "Mice", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Nuclear Proteins", "Optogenetics", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Principal Component Analysis", "Pyramidal Cells", "Synapses", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957071074", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54681634800": {"Name": "Anastasiades P.G.", "AuthorID": "54681634800", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Science, New York University"}, "55500396300": {"Name": "Marques-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "55500396300", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "55618455300": {"Name": "Lyngholm D.", "AuthorID": "55618455300", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "54881074000": {"Name": "Lickiss T.", "AuthorID": "54881074000", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "37034229300": {"Name": "Katzel D.", "AuthorID": "37034229300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6604040842": {"Name": "Miesenbock G.", "AuthorID": "6604040842", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University of Oxford"}, "9276082200": {"Name": "Butt S.J.B.", "AuthorID": "9276082200", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57095932600": {"Name": "Raffiq S.", "AuthorID": "57095932600", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London"}}}
