This information is used to segment image data into individual particles, where each particle and its defects are identified accordingly. We apply the method to particle systems that appear in Li-ion battery electrodes. First, the algorithm is validated using simulated data from a stochastic 3D microstructure model, where we have full information about defects. This allows us to quantify the accuracy of the segmentation result. Then we show that the algorithm can successfully be applied to tomographic image data from real battery anodes and cathodes, which are composed of particle systems with very different morpohological properties. Finally, we show how the results of the segmentation algorithm can be used for structural analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breakages", "cracks", "particles", "segmentation", "thermal runaway"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032217314", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"56458083300": {"Name": "Westhoff D.", "AuthorID": "56458083300", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Stochastics, Ulm University"}, "7202394043": {"Name": "Schmidt V.", "AuthorID": "7202394043", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Stochastics, Ulm University"}, "56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
