The technological proposals for doing this are highly speculative. Research is at an early stage, but there is a strong consensus that technologies would, if realisable, have profound and surprising ramifications. Geoengineering would seem to be an archetype of technology as social experiment, blurring lines that separate research from deployment and scientific knowledge from technological artefacts. Looking into the experimental systems of geoengineering, we can see the negotiation of what is known and unknown. The paper argues that, in renegotiating such systems, we can approach a new mode of governance\u2014collective experimentation. This has important ramifications not just for how we imagine future geoengineering technologies, but also for how we govern geoengineering experiments currently under discussion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate engineering", "Collective experimentation", "Geoengineering", "Governance", "Responsible research and innovation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Engineering", "Global Warming", "Inventions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927534151", "SubjectAreas": [["Issues, Ethics and Legal Aspects", "NURS", "2910"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"8243812400": {"Name": "Stilgoe J.", "AuthorID": "8243812400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
