More specifically, understanding beta cell development remains an issue, despite recent progress related to their generation from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we use an integrated approach, including prospective isolation, organ culture, and characterization of intermediate stages, and report that cells from human and mouse fetal pancreas can be expanded in the long term and give rise to hollow duct-like structures in 3D cultures. The expanded cells express a combination of markers (E-cadherin, PDX1, NKX6-1, SOX9, and HNF1\u03b2) that reveals pancreatic progenitor identity. Proliferation of embryonic progenitors was stimulated by the Wnt agonist R-spondin1 (RSPO1), FGF10, and EGF. This combination of growth factors allowed maintaining human fetal pancreatic progenitors in culture for many passages, a finding not reported previously. Importantly, in the absence of EGF, proliferation was reduced, while endocrine differentiation was significantly enhanced. We conclude that modulation of EGF signaling affects in vitro expansion and differentiation of progenitors from embryonic pancreas of both mice and man.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "Fetus", "Humans", "Mice", "Pancreas", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937708444", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36620172300": {"Name": "Bonfanti P.", "AuthorID": "36620172300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health and Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "6507003654": {"Name": "Laurysens V.", "AuthorID": "6507003654", "AffiliationID": "60070081, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "7005420751": {"Name": "Stang\u00e9 G.", "AuthorID": "7005420751", "AffiliationID": "60070081, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "55629934500": {"Name": "Sojoodi M.", "AuthorID": "55629934500", "AffiliationID": "60070081, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "6507469678": {"Name": "Heremans Y.", "AuthorID": "6507469678", "AffiliationID": "60070081, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "7003495114": {"Name": "Heimberg H.", "AuthorID": "7003495114", "AffiliationID": "60070081, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "6504805674": {"Name": "Nobecourt E.", "AuthorID": "6504805674", "AffiliationID": "60105574, 60028048", "AffiliationName": "UMR 1280, PhAN, CHU"}, "56732461700": {"Name": "Oshima M.", "AuthorID": "56732461700", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1016, Institut CochinUniversit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris"}, "7801576613": {"Name": "Albagli-Curiel O.", "AuthorID": "7801576613", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1016, Institut CochinUniversit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris"}, "7006416600": {"Name": "Scharfmann R.", "AuthorID": "7006416600", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1016, Institut CochinUniversit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris"}}}
