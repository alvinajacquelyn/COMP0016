This paper investigates students\u2019 experiences of school as a context for digital technology use. Drawing upon survey data from three Australian secondary schools (n = 1174), this paper considers the various ways in which students use digital devices and applications \u201cin school\u201d and \u201cfor school\u201d. After highlighting trends and differences across a range of digital devices and practices, the paper explores the ways in which students perceive school as a limiting and/or enabling setting for technology use. The findings point to a number of ways that schools act to extend as well as curtail student engagement with technology. This paper concludes by considering the possible ways that schools might work to further support and/or enhance students\u2019 technology experiences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital", "Schools", "students", "technology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975270801", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"16644651100": {"Name": "Bulfin S.", "AuthorID": "16644651100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, Monash University"}, "57188874072": {"Name": "Nemorin S.", "AuthorID": "57188874072", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, Monash University"}, "55882979400": {"Name": "Selwyn N.", "AuthorID": "55882979400", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, Monash University"}, "56874241100": {"Name": "Johnson N.", "AuthorID": "56874241100", "AffiliationID": "60010859", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Federation University Australia"}}}
