Three hundred and thirty-nine patients were randomised (2:1) to receive everolimus or not for a maximum of 84 days between chemotherapy courses. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. At 5 years there was no difference in relapsefree survival [29% versus 40%; odds ratio 1.19 (0.9-1.59) P=0.2], cumulative incidence of relapse [60% versus 54%: odds ratio 1.12 (0.82-1.52): P=0.5] or overall survival [45% versus 58%: odds ratio 1.3 (0.94-1.81): P=0.11]. The independent Data Monitoring Committee advised study termination after randomization of 339 of the intended 600 patients because of excess mortality in the everolimus arm without any evidence of beneficial disease control. The delivery of the everolimus dose was variable, but there was no evidence of clinical benefit in patients with adequate dose delivery compared with no treatment. This study suggests that the addition of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition to chemotherapy provides no benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Consolidation Chemotherapy", "Disease-Free Survival", "Everolimus", "Female", "Humans", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Survival Rate", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054344402", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7103199592": {"Name": "Burnett A.K.", "AuthorID": "7103199592", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Formerly Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "56471532300": {"Name": "Gupta E.D.", "AuthorID": "56471532300", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7201812899": {"Name": "Russell N.H.", "AuthorID": "7201812899", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "15069283600": {"Name": "Knapper S.", "AuthorID": "15069283600", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7201380052": {"Name": "Sweeney M.", "AuthorID": "7201380052", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7005296444": {"Name": "Khwaja A.", "AuthorID": "7005296444", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, London Cancer Institute"}, "7003469420": {"Name": "Kjeldsen L.", "AuthorID": "7003469420", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet"}, "57202657126": {"Name": "Hawkins T.", "AuthorID": "57202657126", "AffiliationID": "60011750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Auckland City Hospital"}, "57191904093": {"Name": "Betteridge S.E.", "AuthorID": "57191904093", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trials Research, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "6507420720": {"Name": "Cahalin P.", "AuthorID": "6507420720", "AffiliationID": "60019602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Blackpool Victoria Hospital"}, "16549136400": {"Name": "Clark R.E.", "AuthorID": "16549136400", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "7005927424": {"Name": "Hills R.K.", "AuthorID": "7005927424", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
