The sample consisted of 115 dyads with children's ages ranging from 1 to 47 months. Sixty-four dyads were recruited from community settings without known violence problems, and 51 dyads were recruited from clinical settings and already had been identified with violence problems or as being at risk for violence problems. To classify the dyads on the PIR-GAS categories, caregiver\u2013child interactions were video-recorded and coded with observational scales appropriate for child age. To test whether the PIR-GAS allows for reliable identification of dyads with abusive relationship patterns, PIR-GAS ratings were compared with scores on the the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect's (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parental Version (ICAST-P; D.K. Runyan et al.,), a questionnaire measuring abusive parental disciplinary practices. It was found that PIR-GAS ratings differentiated between the general and the clinical sample, and the dyads with abusive patterns of relationship were identified by both the PIR-GAS and the ICAST-P. Interrater reliability for the PIR-GAS ranged from moderate to excellent. The value of a broader use of tools such as the DC: 0\u20133R to promote early identification of families at risk for infant and toddler abuse and neglect is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DC: 0\u20133R", "infant and toddler abuse and neglect", "PIR-GAS", "relationship classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Caregivers", "Child Abuse", "Child, Preschool", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Income", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parent-Child Relations", "Pilot Projects", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978034285", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36679900500": {"Name": "Hatzinikolaou K.", "AuthorID": "36679900500", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57190163969": {"Name": "Karveli V.", "AuthorID": "57190163969", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "57190180009": {"Name": "Skoubourdi A.", "AuthorID": "57190180009", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "56589123600": {"Name": "Zarokosta F.", "AuthorID": "56589123600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "57215465857": {"Name": "Nikolaidis G.", "AuthorID": "57215465857", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "57190162617": {"Name": "Antonucci G.", "AuthorID": "57190162617", "AffiliationID": "119146085", "AffiliationName": "Associazone Focolare Maria Regina Onlus"}, "57190176099": {"Name": "Visci G.", "AuthorID": "57190176099", "AffiliationID": "119146085", "AffiliationName": "Associazone Focolare Maria Regina Onlus"}, "39760957600": {"Name": "Calheiros M.M.", "AuthorID": "39760957600", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universitario de Lisboa"}, "35203732000": {"Name": "Magalh\u00c3es E.", "AuthorID": "35203732000", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universitario de Lisboa"}, "7004864931": {"Name": "Essau C.", "AuthorID": "7004864931", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Roehampton University"}, "57190164328": {"Name": "Allan S.", "AuthorID": "57190164328", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Roehampton University"}, "56259267300": {"Name": "Pithia J.", "AuthorID": "56259267300", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Roehampton University"}, "57190178790": {"Name": "Walji F.", "AuthorID": "57190178790", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Roehampton University"}, "6603179702": {"Name": "Ezpeleta L.", "AuthorID": "6603179702", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "54783224000": {"Name": "Perez-Robles R.", "AuthorID": "54783224000", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "7801498429": {"Name": "Fanti K.A.", "AuthorID": "7801498429", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}, "56820282200": {"Name": "Katsimicha E.", "AuthorID": "56820282200", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}, "57190171517": {"Name": "Hadjicharambous M.Z.", "AuthorID": "57190171517", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}, "7403320680": {"Name": "Reddy V.", "AuthorID": "7403320680", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Portsmouth University"}}}
