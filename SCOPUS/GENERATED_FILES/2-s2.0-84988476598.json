The majority of previous research focused on narrative tasks designed for hearing children that depend on good receptive language skills. The current study compared narratives of 6 to 11-year-old deaf children who use spoken English (N = 59) with matched for age and non-verbal intelligence hearing peers. To examine the role of general language abilities, single word vocabulary was also assessed. Narratives were elicited by the retelling of a story presented non-verbally in video format. Results showed that deaf and hearing children had equivalent macro-structure skills, but the deaf group showed poorer performance on micro-structural components. Furthermore, the deaf group gave less detailed responses to inferencing probe questions indicating poorer understanding of the story's underlying message. For deaf children, micro-level devices most strongly correlated with the vocabulary measure. These findings suggest that deaf children, despite spoken language delays, are able to convey the main elements of content and structure in narrative but have greater difficulty in using grammatical devices more dependent on finer linguistic and pragmatic skills.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deaf children", "Inference-making", "Narrative macrostructure", "Narrative microstructure", "Oral language"], "IndexKeywords": ["Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Cochlear Implantation", "Comprehension", "Deafness", "Female", "Hearing Aids", "Humans", "Language Development", "Male", "Narration", "Speech"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988476598", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56681566200": {"Name": "Jones A.C.", "AuthorID": "56681566200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College"}, "7402665252": {"Name": "Atkinson J.R.", "AuthorID": "7402665252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College"}, "15073671300": {"Name": "Denmark T.", "AuthorID": "15073671300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College"}, "14621764900": {"Name": "Morgan G.", "AuthorID": "14621764900", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University"}, "57191263920": {"Name": "Toscano E.", "AuthorID": "57191263920", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "University of Trento"}, "56237530700": {"Name": "Botting N.", "AuthorID": "56237530700", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University"}, "57216710405": {"Name": "Herman R.", "AuthorID": "57216710405", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University"}, "7201903216": {"Name": "Marshall C.R.", "AuthorID": "7201903216", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College"}}}
