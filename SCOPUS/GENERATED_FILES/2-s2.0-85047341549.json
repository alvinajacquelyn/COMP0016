Besides traditional approaches that rely on wearable devices and camera systems, WiFi-based technologies are evolving as a promising solution for indoor monitoring and activity recognition. This is, in part, due to the pervasive nature of WiFi in residential settings such as homes and care facilities, and the unobtrusive nature of WiFi-based sensing. Advanced signal processing techniques can accurately extract WiFi channel status information (CSI) using commercial off-The-shelf devices or bespoke hardware. This includes phase variations, frequency shifts, and signal levels. In this article, we describe the healthcare application of Doppler shifts in the WiFi CSI caused by human activities that take place in the signal coverage area. The technique is shown to recognize different types of human activities and behavior and be very suitable for applications in healthcare. Three experimental case studies are presented to illustrate the capabilities of WiFi CSI Doppler sensing in assisted living and residential care environments. We also discuss the potential opportunities and practical challenges for realworld scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activity recognition", "Advanced signal processing", "Channel status informations", "Commercial off the shelf devices", "Health care application", "Health care informatics", "Healthcare problems", "Traditional approaches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047341549", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56342423200": {"Name": "Tan B.", "AuthorID": "56342423200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University and the University College London"}, "34867832000": {"Name": "Chetty K.", "AuthorID": "34867832000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University and the University College London"}, "56939438700": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "56939438700", "AffiliationID": "120729065", "AffiliationName": "Kevin Chetty"}, "7003652416": {"Name": "Woodbridge K.", "AuthorID": "7003652416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190582547": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57190582547", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "7003301240": {"Name": "Piechocki R.", "AuthorID": "7003301240", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}}}
