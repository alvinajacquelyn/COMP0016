We explore the conditions under which different types of reciprocity gain dominance and their performances in sustaining cooperation in the PD played on simple networks. We confirm that direct reciprocity gains dominance over indirect reciprocity strategies also in larger populations, as long as it has no memory constraints. In the absence of direct reciprocity, or when its memory is flawed, different forms of indirect reciprocity strategies are able to dominate and to support cooperation. We show that indirect reciprocity relying on social capital inherent in closed triads is the best competitor among them, outperforming indirect reciprocity that uses information from any source. Results hold in a wide range of conditions with different evolutionary update rules, extent of evolutionary pressure, initial conditions, population size, and density.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050619401", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35754777700": {"Name": "Righi S.", "AuthorID": "35754777700", "AffiliationID": "60182614", "AffiliationName": "Hungarian Academy of Sciences, MTA TK \u201cLend\u00fclet\u201d Research Center for Educational and Network Studies (RECENS)"}, "18038619600": {"Name": "Tak\u00e1cs K.", "AuthorID": "18038619600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
