The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea and the continuing reports of MERS-CoV cases from Saudi Arabia highlight the need for active surveillance for MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travellers from the Middle East. Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory (PHEBL) is one of a few selected UK public health laboratories responsible for MERS-CoV screening in travellers returning to the UK from the Middle East who present to hospital with severe respiratory symptoms. The results of the PHEBL MERS-CoV screening and surveillance over the past 3 years is presented. Methods UK travellers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented to a hospital with respiratory symptoms were studied over the period February 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients with respiratory symptoms, who satisfied the Public Health England MERS-CoV case algorithm, were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses on admission to hospital. Results Two hundred and two patients suspected of having MERS-CoV were tested. None of them had a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. A viral aetiology was detected in half (50.3%) of the cases, with rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B being most frequent. Peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and in other periods of raised national awareness. Conclusions Respiratory tract infections in travellers/pilgrims returning to the UK from the Middle East are mainly due to rhinoviruses, influenza A, and influenza B. Whilst MERS-CoV was not detected in the 202 patients studied, heightened awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV and continuous proactive surveillance are essential to rapidly identify cases of MERS-CoV and other seasonal respiratory tract viruses such as avian influenza, in patients presenting to hospital. Early identification and isolation may prevent outbreaks in nosocomial settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mass gatherings", "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)", "Pilgrimage", "Respiratory viruses", "Surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Coronavirus Infections", "Cross Infection", "Disease Outbreaks", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype", "Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype", "Influenza, Human", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Middle East", "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus", "Prospective Studies", "Republic of Korea", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Rhinovirus", "Saudi Arabia", "Travel", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967188763", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6506262126": {"Name": "Atabani S.F.", "AuthorID": "6506262126", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory, National Infection Service, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55470792900": {"Name": "Wilson S.", "AuthorID": "55470792900", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory, National Infection Service, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189267405": {"Name": "Overton-Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "57189267405", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory, National Infection Service, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "17347003700": {"Name": "Workman J.", "AuthorID": "17347003700", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory, National Infection Service, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102109290": {"Name": "Smit E.", "AuthorID": "7102109290", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory, National Infection Service, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005733119": {"Name": "Osman H.", "AuthorID": "7005733119", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory, National Infection Service, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55444400500": {"Name": "Kidd I.M.", "AuthorID": "55444400500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202854790": {"Name": "Petersen E.", "AuthorID": "7202854790", "AffiliationID": "60071784", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Hospital"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, UK National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}}}
