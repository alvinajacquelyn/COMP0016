We demonstrate the restructuring of AuPd nanoparticles under CO oxidation conditions using a combined XAFS/DRIFTS approach. The fresh catalyst exhibits PdO islands at the surface of the nanoparticles, which are reduced under reaction conditions, a process observed via both DRIFTS and Pd K-edge XAFS measurements. From the EXAFS analysis alone the nanoparticles were observed to have a Au rich core with an outer region of intimately mixed Au and Pd atoms. This structure was found to remain mostly unaltered throughout reaction. However, the DRIFTS spectra showed that although Au was present on the surface during the initial stages of reaction the surface rearranged just before light-off, and contained only Pd atoms thereafter. This study highlights the advantage of this combined approach, where both the surface structure and local environment of the constituent metals can be probed simultaneously, allowing a complete picture of the restructuring of these bimetallic particles to be obtained under reaction conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bimetallic particles", "Co oxidation", "Exafs analysis", "Fresh catalysts", "Light off", "Local environments", "Reaction conditions", "XAFS measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930221726", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"8306766600": {"Name": "Gibson E.K.", "AuthorID": "8306766600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "18633292200": {"Name": "Chutia A.", "AuthorID": "18633292200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56379692300": {"Name": "Gould A.", "AuthorID": "56379692300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56501628100": {"Name": "Mohammed K.M.H.", "AuthorID": "56501628100", "AffiliationID": "60014101", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Sohag University"}, "56663288300": {"Name": "Perdjon M.", "AuthorID": "56663288300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56204136500": {"Name": "Rogers S.M.", "AuthorID": "56204136500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35271498800": {"Name": "Gianolio D.", "AuthorID": "35271498800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55372640600": {"Name": "Kroner A.", "AuthorID": "55372640600", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
