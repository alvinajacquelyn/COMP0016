In this work, we perform a quantitative assessment of the currently used ordered subset (OS) algorithms for low-counts PET-MR data taken from a Siemens Biograph mMR scanner using the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR, stir.sf.net). A comparison has been performed in terms of bias and coefficient of variation (CoV). Within the STIR library different algorithms are available, such as Order Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM), OS Maximum A Posteriori One Step Late (OSMA-POSL) with Quadratic Prior (QP) and with Median Root Prior (MRP), OS Separable Paraboloidal Surrogate (OSSPS) with QP and Filtered Back-Projection (FBP). In addition, List Mode (LM) reconstruction is available. Corrections for attenuation, scatter and random events are performed using STIR instead of using the scanner. Data from the Hoffman brain phantom are acquired, processed and reconstructed. Clinical data from the thorax of a patient have also been reconstructed with the same algorithms. The number of subsets does not appreciably affect the bias nor the coefficient of variation (CoV=11%) at a fixed sub-iteration number. The percentage relative bias and CoV maximum values for OSMAPOSL-MRP are 10% and 15% at 360 s acquisition and 12% and 15% for the 36 s, whilst for OSMAPOSL-QP they are 6% and 16% for 360 s acquisition and 11% and 23% at 36 s and for OSEM 6% and 11% for the 360 s acquisition and 10% and 15% for the 36 s. Our findings demonstrate that when it comes to low-counts, noise and bias become significant. The methodology for reconstructing Siemens mMR data with STIR is included in the CCP-PET-MR website (www.ccppetmr.ac.uk).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coefficient of variation", "Expectation - maximizations", "Filtered back projection", "Image reconstruction methods", "Iterative reconstruction algorithms", "List-mode reconstruction", "Median root priors (MRP)", "Software for tomographic image reconstruction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041493285", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"57194126583": {"Name": "Deidda D.", "AuthorID": "57194126583", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Imaging, LICAMM, School of Medicine, Department of Statistics, School of Mathematics, University of Leeds"}, "15821657900": {"Name": "Efthimiou N.", "AuthorID": "15821657900", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL Hospital"}, "36630440300": {"Name": "Manber R.", "AuthorID": "36630440300", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL Hospital"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL Hospital"}, "8699700500": {"Name": "Markiewicz P.", "AuthorID": "8699700500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}, "6701470813": {"Name": "Aykroyd R.G.", "AuthorID": "6701470813", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, School of Mathematics, University of Leeds"}, "23480821300": {"Name": "Tsoumpas C.", "AuthorID": "23480821300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Imaging, LI-CAMM, School of Medicine, University of Leeds"}}}
