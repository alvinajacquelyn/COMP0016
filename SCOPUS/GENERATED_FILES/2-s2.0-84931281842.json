Stable oxygen isotopes were measured in the body fluid (\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>body</inf>) and shells (\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>shell</inf>) of live-collected H. melanostoma along a north-south transect across the Gebel Akhdar in northeast Libya. \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>body</inf> ranged between -8.1\u2030 and 13.0\u2030 whilst \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>shell</inf> ranged between -1.0\u2030 and +2.8\u2030. To investigate the relationship between snail oxygen isotope composition and climate, these measurements were correlated with ambient air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall amount, and the \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O composition of rainwater (\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>rain</inf>). Strong and significant correlations were found between \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>shell</inf> and \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>rain</inf>, and between \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>shell</inf> and rainfall amount (R<sup>2</sup>=0.79 and 0.85 respectively) suggesting that H. melanostoma shells can be used as a proxy for past rainfall conditions. When combined in multiple linear regressions, \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>rain</inf> and rainfall amount explained 90% of the variance in \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O<inf>shell</inf> (R<sup>2</sup>=0.90). Simple and multiple linear regressions were used to develop predictive models for these climate parameters. As H. melanostoma shells are commonly found in Mediterranean and North African archaeological and geological deposits, the predictive equations developed in this study hold great potential for reconstructing Pleistocene to Holocene rainfall and aridity patterns in the Gebel Akhdar and for assessing the relationship between environmental changes and human behavioural changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Molluscs", "Palaeoclimate", "Palaeoenvironment", "Rainfall", "Stable isotopes", "Terrestrial gastropods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient air temperature", "Multiple linear regressions", "Oxygen isotope composition", "Palaeoclimate", "Palaeoenvironment", "Stable isotopes", "Stable oxygen isotopes", "Terrestrial gastropods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931281842", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"25633158200": {"Name": "Prendergast A.", "AuthorID": "25633158200", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geosciences, University of Mainz"}, "8747066900": {"Name": "Stevens R.", "AuthorID": "8747066900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Archaeology, University College London"}, "7202030377": {"Name": "Barker G.", "AuthorID": "7202030377", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7102366592": {"Name": "O'Connell T.", "AuthorID": "7102366592", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}}}
