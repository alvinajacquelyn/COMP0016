Rutherford and colleagues solve this problem elegantly: bicarbonate tunes water-oxidising photosystem II to make onward electron transfer efficient; an absence of bicarbonate retunes, redirects, and safely shuts down energy flow.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron Transport", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Photosynthesis", "Photosystem II Protein Complex", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008199386", "SubjectAreas": [["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"]], "AuthorData": {"57213484434": {"Name": "Allen J.", "AuthorID": "57213484434", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "6603851229": {"Name": "Nield J.", "AuthorID": "6603851229", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
