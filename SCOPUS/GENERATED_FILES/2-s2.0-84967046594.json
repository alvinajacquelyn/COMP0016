When combined with a differential scanning fluorimetry technique, it enables highly sensitive and selective detection of demethylase activity at a single methylated-base level. The approach is highly versatile and may be adapted to a broad range of RNA demethylases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["AlkB Enzymes", "Base Sequence", "Circular Dichroism", "Fluorometry", "Kinetics", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Methylation", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "RNA", "RNA, Double-Stranded", "Transition Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967046594", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55470243000": {"Name": "Yang T.", "AuthorID": "55470243000", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "57189258100": {"Name": "Cheong A.", "AuthorID": "57189258100", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "57189257475": {"Name": "Mai X.", "AuthorID": "57189257475", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "55507320200": {"Name": "Zou S.", "AuthorID": "55507320200", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "8845545300": {"Name": "Woon E.C.Y.", "AuthorID": "8845545300", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}}}
