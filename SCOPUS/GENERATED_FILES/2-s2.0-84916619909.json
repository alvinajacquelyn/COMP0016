Methods: We identified prospective studies that looked at depressive symptoms in the community as a risk factor for non-psychiatric general hospital admissions, length of stay or risk of re-admission. The search was carried out on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library Database, and followed up with contact with authors and scanning of reference lists. Results: Eleven studies fulfilled our inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all were deemed to be of moderate to high quality. Meta-analysis of seven studies with relevant data suggested that depressive symptoms may be a predictor of subsequent admission to a general hospital in unadjusted analyses (RR. =. 1.36, 95% CI: 1.28-1.44), but findings after adjustment for confounding variables were inconsistent. The narrative synthesis also reported depressive symptoms to be independently associated with longer length of stay, and higher re-admission risk. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation, longer length of stay and a higher re-admission risk. Some of these associations may be mediated by other factors, and should be explored in more details.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Depression", "Depressive symptoms", "Hospitalisation", "Length of stay", "Patient re-admission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Factual", "Depression", "Hospitalization", "Hospitals, General", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Length of Stay", "Patient Admission", "Patient Readmission", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916619909", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57207840403": {"Name": "Prina A.M.", "AuthorID": "57207840403", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177638", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Health Service and Population Research Department, Centre for Global Mental Health"}, "55948960700": {"Name": "Cosco T.D.", "AuthorID": "55948960700", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health"}, "57210386759": {"Name": "Brayne C.", "AuthorID": "57210386759", "AffiliationID": "114325504", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research, Care for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (CLAHRC-CP)"}, "7004547326": {"Name": "Dening T.", "AuthorID": "7004547326", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7005920751": {"Name": "Beekman A.", "AuthorID": "7005920751", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center"}, "55883271500": {"Name": "Huisman M.", "AuthorID": "55883271500", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, VU University"}}}
