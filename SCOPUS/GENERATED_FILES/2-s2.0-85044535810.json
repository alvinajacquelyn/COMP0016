Objectives: This study sought to investigate whether human myocardial interstitial fibrosis in aortic stenosis (AS) is plastic and can regress. Methods: Patients with symptomatic, severe AS (n = 181; aortic valve area index 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 cm2/m2) were assessed pre\u2013aortic valve replacement (AVR) by echocardiography (AS severity, diastology), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) (for volumes, function, and focal or diffuse fibrosis), biomarkers (N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T), and the 6-min walk test. CMR was used to measure the extracellular volume fraction (ECV), thereby deriving matrix volume (LV mass \u00d7 ECV) and cell volume (LV mass \u00d7 [1 \u2212 ECV]). Biopsy excluded occult bystander disease. Assessment was repeated at 1 year post-AVR. Results: At 1 year post-AVR in 116 pacemaker-free survivors (age 70 \u00b1 10 years; 54% male), mean valve gradient had improved (48 \u00b1 16 mm Hg to 12 \u00b1 6 mm Hg; p < 0.001), and indexed LV mass had regressed by 19% (88 \u00b1 26 g/m2 to 71 \u00b1 19 g/m2; p < 0.001). Focal fibrosis by CMR late gadolinium enhancement did not change, but ECV increased (28.2 \u00b1 2.9% to 29.9 \u00b1 4.0%; p < 0.001): this was the result of a 16% reduction in matrix volume (25 \u00b1 9 ml/m2 to 21 \u00b1 7 ml/m2; p < 0.001) but a proportionally greater 22% reduction in cell volume (64 \u00b1 18 ml/m2 to 50 \u00b1 13 ml/m2; p < 0.001). These changes were accompanied by improvement in diastolic function, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, 6-min walk test results, and New York Heart Association functional class. Conclusions: Post-AVR, focal fibrosis does not resolve, but diffuse fibrosis and myocardial cellular hypertrophy regress. Regression is accompanied by structural and functional improvements suggesting that human diffuse fibrosis is plastic, measurable by CMR and a potential therapeutic target.
