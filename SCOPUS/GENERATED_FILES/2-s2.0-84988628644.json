A complex interaction between ascending lower genital tract infection and the maternal immune system is a likely underlying component of pathogenesis. In this chapter we consider the ways in which expression of antimicrobial peptides in the maternal genital tract may modulate the risk of ascending genital tract infection and thus the risk of preterm birth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988628644", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"56454785400": {"Name": "James C.", "AuthorID": "56454785400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "6603047821": {"Name": "Bajaj-Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "6603047821", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
