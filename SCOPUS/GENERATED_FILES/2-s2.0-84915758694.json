Published by Elsevier Ltd.\u03b11-Antitrypsin is primarily synthesised in the liver, circulates to the lung and protects pulmonary tissues from proteolytic damage. The Z mutant (Glu342Lys) undergoes inactivating conformational change and polymerises. Polymers are retained within the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in homozygous (PiZZ) individuals, predisposing the individuals to hepatic cirrhosis and emphysema. Latency is an analogous process of inactivating, intra-molecular conformational change and may co-occur with polymerisation. However, the relationship between latency and polymerisation remained unexplored in the absence of a suitable probe. We have developed a novel monoclonal antibody specific for latent \u03b11-antitrypsin and used it in combination with a polymer-specific antibody, to assess the association of both conformers in vitro, in disease and during augmentation therapy. In vitro kinetics analysis showed polymerisation dominated the pathway but latency could be promoted by stabilising monomeric \u03b11-antitrypsin. Polymers were extensively produced in hepatocytes and a cell line expressing Z \u03b11-antitrypsin but the latent protein was not detected despite manipulation of the secretory pathway. However, \u03b11-antitrypsin augmentation therapy contains latent \u03b11-antitrypsin, as did the plasma of 63/274 PiZZ individuals treated with augmentation therapy but 0/264 who were not receiving this medication (p < 10-14). We conclude that latent \u03b11-antitrypsin is a by-product of the polymerisation pathway, that the intracellular folding environment is resistant to formation of the latent conformer but that augmentation therapy introduces latent \u03b11-antitrypsin into the circulation. A suite of monoclonal antibodies and methodologies developed in this study can characterise \u03b11-antitrypsin folding and conformational transitions, and screen methods to improve augmentation therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Augmentation therapy", "Latency", "Monoclonal antibodies", "Polymerisation", "\u03b11-Antitrypsin"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha 1-Antitrypsin", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Kinetics", "Polymerization", "Protein Structure, Secondary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84915758694", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"35312598800": {"Name": "Tan L.", "AuthorID": "35312598800", "AffiliationID": "60002612", "AffiliationName": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology"}, "15840182900": {"Name": "Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez A.", "AuthorID": "15840182900", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "55153326400": {"Name": "Dickens J.A.", "AuthorID": "55153326400", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "8739910600": {"Name": "Marciniak S.J.", "AuthorID": "8739910600", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "7403417807": {"Name": "Perez J.", "AuthorID": "7403417807", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Genetics and Physiology, University of M\u00e1laga"}, "56439296700": {"Name": "Mela M.", "AuthorID": "56439296700", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Department of Medicine, Cambridge University Hospitals"}, "15732485400": {"Name": "Alexander G.J.M.", "AuthorID": "15732485400", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Department of Medicine, Cambridge University Hospitals"}, "8377905200": {"Name": "Miranda E.", "AuthorID": "8377905200", "AffiliationID": "60105089, 60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biotechnologies Charles Darwin, Pasteur Institute-Cenci Bolognetti Foundation-University of Rome La Sapienza"}, "15058551600": {"Name": "Burling K.A.", "AuthorID": "15058551600", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603279450": {"Name": "Rouhani F.N.", "AuthorID": "6603279450", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida"}, "55628588700": {"Name": "Brantly M.", "AuthorID": "55628588700", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida"}, "6603687762": {"Name": "DeMeo D.L.", "AuthorID": "6603687762", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "35487611700": {"Name": "Haq I.", "AuthorID": "35487611700", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "26643229900": {"Name": "Irving J.A.", "AuthorID": "26643229900", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "35391622600": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "35391622600", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "6506674023": {"Name": "Gooptu B.", "AuthorID": "6506674023", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}}}
