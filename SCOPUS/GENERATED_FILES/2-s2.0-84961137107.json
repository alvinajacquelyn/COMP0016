All rights reserved.This book presents a new way for educators at all levels - from early years to university - to think about curriculum priorities. It focuses on the curriculum as a form of specialised knowledge, optimally designed to enable students to gain access to the best knowledge available in any field. Papers jointly written by the authors over the last eight years are revised for this volume. It draws on the sociology of knowledge and in particular the work of Emile Durkheim and Basil Bernstein, opening up the possibilities for collaborative inter-disciplinary enquiry with historians, philosophers and psychologists. Although primarily directed to researchers, university teachers and graduate students, its arguments about specialised knowledge have profound implications for policy makers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961137107", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7404193621": {"Name": "Young M.", "AuthorID": "7404193621", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7404871760": {"Name": "Muller J.", "AuthorID": "7404871760", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Cape Town"}}}
