We investigated the chromatin basis for these developmental milestones in mouse endoderm, a tissue with recognizable rostro\u2013caudal patterning and transcription factor (TF)-dependent interim plasticity. Foregut-specific enhancers are as accessible and active in early midgut as in foregut endoderm, and intestinal enhancers and identity are established only after ectopic cis-regulatory elements are decommissioned. Depletion of the intestinal TF CDX2 before this cis element transition stabilizes foregut enhancers, reinforces ectopic transcriptional programs, and hence imposes foregut identities on the midgut. Later in development, as the window of chromatin plasticity elapses, CDX2 depletion weakens intestinal, without strengthening foregut, enhancers. Thus, midgut endoderm is primed for heterologous cell fates, and TFs act on a background of shifting chromatin access to determine intestinal at the expense of foregut identity. Similar principles likely govern other fate commitments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromatin plasticity", "Developmental competence", "Developmental plasticity", "Fate determination", "Homeodomain transcription factors", "Lineage commitment", "Tissue specification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CDX2 Transcription Factor", "Chromatin", "Endoderm", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Intestines", "Mice", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055909283", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57209111715": {"Name": "Banerjee K.", "AuthorID": "57209111715", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "35201966000": {"Name": "Saxena M.", "AuthorID": "35201966000", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "55365170800": {"Name": "Cavazza A.", "AuthorID": "55365170800", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57200330873": {"Name": "O\u2019Neill N.", "AuthorID": "57200330873", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "56960653000": {"Name": "Madha S.", "AuthorID": "56960653000", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "8256184000": {"Name": "Jadhav U.", "AuthorID": "8256184000", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006543399": {"Name": "Shivdasani R.", "AuthorID": "7006543399", "AffiliationID": "60027452", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Stem Cell Institute"}, "56664998200": {"Name": "Kumar N.", "AuthorID": "56664998200", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey"}, "56673050400": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "56673050400", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey"}, "57201801290": {"Name": "Toke N.", "AuthorID": "57201801290", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey"}, "6603266945": {"Name": "Verzi M.", "AuthorID": "6603266945", "AffiliationID": "60120069", "AffiliationName": "Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey"}}}
