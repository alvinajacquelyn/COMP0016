Methods: We first sought to identify genetic associations with white matter hyperintensities in a stroke population, and then examined whether genetic loci previously linked to WMHV in community populations are also associated in stroke patients. Having established that genetic associations are shared between the 2 populations, we performed a meta-analysis testing which associations with WMHV in stroke-free populations are associated overall when combined with stroke populations. Results: There were no associations at genome-wide significance with WMHV in stroke patients. All previously reported genome-wide significant associations with WMHV in community populations shared direction of effect in stroke patients. In a meta-analysis of the genome-wide significant and suggestive loci (p < 5 \u00d7 10-6) from community populations (15 single nucleotide polymorphisms in total) and from stroke patients, 6 independent loci were associated with WMHV in both populations. Four of these are novel associations at the genome-wide level (rs72934505 [NBEAL1], p 2.2 \u00d7 10-8; rs941898 [EVL], p 4.0 \u00d7 10-8; rs962888 [C1QL1], p 1.1 \u00d7 10-8; rs9515201 [COL4A2], p 6.9 \u00d7 10-9). Conclusions: Genetic associations with WMHV are shared in otherwise healthy individuals and patients with stroke, indicating common genetic susceptibility in cerebral small vessel disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954318325", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55290620300": {"Name": "Traylor M.", "AuthorID": "55290620300", "AffiliationID": "60032885, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "57057234400": {"Name": "Parsons O.E.", "AuthorID": "57057234400", "AffiliationID": "60032885, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "6701393042": {"Name": "Thijs V.", "AuthorID": "6701393042", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "7102054556": {"Name": "Markus H.S.", "AuthorID": "7102054556", "AffiliationID": "60032885, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "56468213600": {"Name": "Zhang C.R.", "AuthorID": "56468213600", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "J.
