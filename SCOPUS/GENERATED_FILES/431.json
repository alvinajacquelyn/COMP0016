These inequalities hold if K is a polytope or of dimension two. An example shows that the proof given in the latter case does not extend to higher dimensions. The example also demonstrates that for n \u2265 3 there exist norms and convex bodies K \u2282 Rn such that the metric projection on K with respect to the metric defined by the given norm is well defined but not a Lipschitz map, which is in striking contrast to the planar or the Euclidean case.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951320704", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "56186616900": {"Name": "Hug D.", "AuthorID": "56186616900", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)"}, "57203295996": {"Name": "Schneider R.", "AuthorID": "57203295996", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Mathematisches Institut, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t"}}}
