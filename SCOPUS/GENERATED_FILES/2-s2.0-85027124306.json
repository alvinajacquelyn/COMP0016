In contrast to the reported simulations and experimental results that rear-located surface plasmon on bare metallic nanoparticles is preferred, the core-shell nanoparticles demonstrate better performance when surface plasmon is located in front of a solar cell. This has been attributed to the enhanced forward scattering with vanishing backward scattering preserved over a wide spectral range in core-shell nanoparticles. This work provides a concept to achieve enhanced forward scattering with weakened backward scattering in plasmonic thin film solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027124306", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57197204655": {"Name": "Yu P.", "AuthorID": "57197204655", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57195320972": {"Name": "Yao Y.", "AuthorID": "57195320972", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15052300200": {"Name": "Niu X.", "AuthorID": "15052300200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "7006264796": {"Name": "Rogach A.L.", "AuthorID": "7006264796", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, Centre for Functional Photonics (CFP), City University of Hong Kong"}}}
