A broader repertoire of techniques including the sensitive viral microneutralization (VMN) assay is now recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Comparing HAI and VMN, we determined immune response to a trivalent 2015\u20132016 seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) administered to 28 recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Vaccination was within the first-year post-transplant at a median of 78.5 (24\u2013363) days. The proportion of patients with baseline and post-vaccination HAI titres \u2265 1:40 were 28.6% and 25% for A(H1N1)pdm09, 14.3% at both timepoints for A(H3N2), and 32.1% and 25% for B(Phuket). Pre and Post-vaccination geometric mean titres(GMT) were higher by VMN than HAI for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), but lower for B(Phuket)(p=<0.05). Geometric mean ratios(GMR) of baseline and post-vaccination titres were similar by HAI and VMN(p > 0.05) for all components. A single seroconversion to A(H1N1) was detected by ELISA-VMN. None of patient age, lymphocyte count, days from transplant to vaccination, donor type, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) at vaccination correlated with baseline or post-vaccination titres by either assay. This absence of seroresponse to SIIV in the first-year post HSCT highlights the need for novel immunogenic vaccination formulations and schedules in this high-risk population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Haematopoietic stem cell transplant", "Immunogenicity", "Inactivated influenza vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antibodies, Viral", "Female", "Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunogenicity, Vaccine", "Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype", "Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype", "Influenza B virus", "Influenza Vaccines", "Influenza, Human", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neutralization Tests", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Vaccination", "Vaccines, Inactivated"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058246767", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57193114488": {"Name": "Miller P.D.E.", "AuthorID": "57193114488", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57203801345": {"Name": "Leonard H.", "AuthorID": "57203801345", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56020759700": {"Name": "Anthias C.", "AuthorID": "56020759700", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603778666": {"Name": "Madrigal A.", "AuthorID": "6603778666", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "24334850600": {"Name": "de Silva T.I.", "AuthorID": "24334850600", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24402410800": {"Name": "Hoschler K.", "AuthorID": "24402410800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "57204594830": {"Name": "Goddard K.", "AuthorID": "57204594830", "AffiliationID": "60006049", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Rothertham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005452706": {"Name": "Snowden J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005452706", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Haematology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
