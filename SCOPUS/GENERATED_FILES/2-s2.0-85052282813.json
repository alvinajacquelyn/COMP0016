Often the feedback loop is closed by asking interns, \u2018was this useful?\u2019 To better answer this question, researchers employed a phenomenological approach to collect interview and focus group data on the lived experiences, perceptions, and understandings of six pre-service special education interns during their internship experience. Emerging themes included satisfaction with level of support provided by supervisory stakeholders, a feeling of isolation from peer support, special consideration of the components within the evaluation tool, and a request to be provided with additional background information for their assigned university coordinators. These lessons were aggregated, presented, and then integrated into the experiences provided to forthcoming pre-service educators.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classroom observation", "ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act)", "IDEA (Individuals withDisabilities Education Act)", "internship", "internship", "IRB(Institutional Review Board)", "pre-service teachers", "special education", "SPMT (Stateprescribed measurement tool)", "ST (supervising teacher)", "Student teaching", "UC (university coordinator)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052282813", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57206634042": {"Name": "Rodriguez J.", "AuthorID": "57206634042", "AffiliationID": "60016114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Curriculum & Instruction, School of Education, The College of William & Mary"}, "57203569765": {"Name": "McKinney T.", "AuthorID": "57203569765", "AffiliationID": "60012387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Learning Sciences, College of Education and Human Development, Georgia State University"}, "57203573933": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "57203573933", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "College of Education, University of Washington"}, "57213610922": {"Name": "Walker Z.", "AuthorID": "57213610922", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, University College London"}, "57189846590": {"Name": "Vince Garland K.", "AuthorID": "57189846590", "AffiliationID": "60032083", "AffiliationName": "Exceptional Education Department, Buffalo State- The State University of New York"}}}
