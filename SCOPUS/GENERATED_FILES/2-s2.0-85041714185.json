The objectives are as follows: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic amylase in drain fluid for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in patients who had undergone pancreatic resection. If we identify heterogeneity, we plan to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity: risk of bias, publication status, prospective or retrospective studies, type of pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomies versus distal pancreatic resection), different aetiologies, and different reference standards.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041714185", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"16301178800": {"Name": "Gurusamy K.S.", "AuthorID": "16301178800", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Campus, UCL Medical School, Department of Surgery"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Campus, UCL Medical School, Department of Surgery"}, "6508389624": {"Name": "Yaghoobi M.", "AuthorID": "6508389624", "AffiliationID": "60071027", "AffiliationName": "McMaster University Health Sciences Centre, Division of Gastroenterology"}}}
