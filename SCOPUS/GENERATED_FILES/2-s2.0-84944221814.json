Nevertheless, how the dopants affect charge transport is not completely understood. Here we unravel the doping effects by explicitly including the scattering of charge carriers with dopants on thermoelectric properties of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT, which is a p-type thermoelectric material with the highest figure of merit reported. We corroborate that the PEDOT exhibits a distinct transition from the aromatic to quinoid-like structure of backbone, and a semiconductor-to-metal transition with an increase in the level of doping. We identify a close-to-unity charge transfer from PEDOT to the dopant, and find that the ionized impurity scattering dominates over the acoustic phonon scattering in the doped PEDOT. By incorporating both scattering mechanisms, the doped PEDOT exhibits mobility, Seebeck coefficient and power factors in very good agreement with the experimental data, and the lightly doped PEDOT exhibits thermoelectric properties superior to the heavily doped one. We reveal that the thermoelectric transport is highly anisotropic in ordered crystals, and suggest to utilize large power factors in the direction of polymer backbone and low lattice thermal conductivity in the stacking and lamellar directions, which is viable in chain-oriented amorphous nanofibers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic-phonon scattering", "Ionized impurity scattering", "Lattice thermal conductivity", "Poly-3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene", "Semiconductor-to-metal transitions", "Thermo-Electric materials", "Thermoelectric figure of merit", "Thermoelectric transport properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944221814", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"55504999500": {"Name": "Shi W.", "AuthorID": "55504999500", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Organic OptoElectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "57213653802": {"Name": "Zhao T.", "AuthorID": "57213653802", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Organic OptoElectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "55316163400": {"Name": "Xi J.", "AuthorID": "55316163400", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Organic OptoElectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "55628533018": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "55628533018", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Organic OptoElectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "7004784475": {"Name": "Shuai Z.", "AuthorID": "7004784475", "AffiliationID": "60018205", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Xiamen University"}}}
