However, in \u2018rescue\u2019 cases, where an individual\u2019s life is in immediate peril, reasoning in terms of cost-effectiveness can appear inhumane. Hence considerations of cost-effectiveness and of rescue appear to be in tension. However, by attending to the division of labour in medical decision making it is possible to see how cost-effectiveness analysis and rescue-style reasoning are commonly combined in an ethically acceptable fashion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cost-effectiveness analysis", "Health Care Resources", "QALY", "Rule of rescue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost effectiveness analysis", "Health care budget", "Healthcare resources", "Medical decision making", "QALY", "Rule of rescue"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924851312", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"35168134800": {"Name": "Orr S.", "AuthorID": "35168134800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Philosophy, Justice and Health, University College London"}, "12800099800": {"Name": "Wolff J.", "AuthorID": "12800099800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Philosophy, Justice and Health, University College London"}}}
