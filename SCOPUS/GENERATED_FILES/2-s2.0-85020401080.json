We perform a meta-analysis to determine the risk of metastatic disease at presentation and after surgery in mrEMVI-positive patients compared with negative tumours.Methods:Electronic databases were searched from January 1980 to March 2016. Conventional meta-analytical techniques were used to provide a summative outcome. Quality assessment of the studies was performed.Results:Six articles reported on mrEMVI in 1262 patients. There were 403 patients in the mrEMVI-positive group and 859 patients in the mrEMVI-negative group. The combined prevalence of mrEMVI-positive tumours was 0.346(range=0.198-0.574). Patients with mrEMVI-positive tumours presented more frequently with metastases compared to mrEMVI-negative tumours (fixed effects model: odds ratio (OR)=5.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.75, 8.61), z=8.21, df=2, P<0.001). Patients who were mrEMVI-positive developed metastases more frequently during follow-up (random effects model: OR=3.91, 95% CI (2.61, 5.86), z=6.63, df=5, P<0.001).Conclusions:MRI-detected extramural vascular invasion is prevalent in one-third of patients with rectal cancer. MRI-detected extramural vascular invasion is a poor prognostic factor as evidenced by the five-fold increased rate of synchronous metastases, and almost four-fold ongoing risk of developing metastases in follow-up after surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["extramural vascular invasion", "MRI", "rectal cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Vessels", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Rectal Neoplasms", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020401080", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"26650121900": {"Name": "Siddiqui M.R.S.", "AuthorID": "26650121900", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "49961363700": {"Name": "Hunter C.", "AuthorID": "49961363700", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "35609458500": {"Name": "Chand M.", "AuthorID": "35609458500", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "14219036300": {"Name": "Bhoday J.", "AuthorID": "14219036300", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "6701361039": {"Name": "Abulafi A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701361039", "AffiliationID": "60017454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, Croydon University Hospital"}, "8772573900": {"Name": "Brown G.", "AuthorID": "8772573900", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "14819767700": {"Name": "Simillis C.", "AuthorID": "14819767700", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "22836449000": {"Name": "Rasheed S.", "AuthorID": "22836449000", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "7003594138": {"Name": "Tekkis P.", "AuthorID": "7003594138", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "34874660500": {"Name": "Garant A.", "AuthorID": "34874660500", "AffiliationID": "60018916, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University"}, "7007103916": {"Name": "Vuong T.", "AuthorID": "7007103916", "AffiliationID": "60018916, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University"}, "23471995100": {"Name": "Artho G.", "AuthorID": "23471995100", "AffiliationID": "60018916, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University"}}}
