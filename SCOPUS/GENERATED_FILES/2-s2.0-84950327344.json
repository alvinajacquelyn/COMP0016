Here, a weakly nonlinear theory is developed for the description of these mesospheric bores. It extends previous theories by allowing internal gravity wave radiation from the duct into the surrounding stratified regions, which are formally assumed to be weakly stratified. The radiation away from the duct is expected to be important for bore energetics. The theory is compared with a numerical simulation of the full Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation. Two initial conditions are considered. The first is a solitary wave solution that would propagate without change of form if the region outside the duct were unstratified. The second is a sinusoid that evolves into an undular bore. The main conclusion is that, while solitary waves and undular bores decay by radiation from the duct, they can survive as significant structures over sufficiently long periods (~100 min) to be observable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circulation/Dynamics", "Gravity waves", "Solitary waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boussinesq approximations", "Density stratification", "Initial conditions", "Internal gravity waves", "Mesopause region", "Soli-tary wave solutions", "Undular bore", "Weakly non-linear theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950327344", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "6602723867": {"Name": "Broutman D.", "AuthorID": "6602723867", "AffiliationID": "60031358", "AffiliationName": "Computational Physics Inc."}, "34771576900": {"Name": "Laughman B.", "AuthorID": "34771576900", "AffiliationID": "60029591", "AffiliationName": "GATS/Boulder Inc."}, "7003684235": {"Name": "Eckermann S.", "AuthorID": "7003684235", "AffiliationID": "60027271", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Division, Naval Research Laboratory"}}}
