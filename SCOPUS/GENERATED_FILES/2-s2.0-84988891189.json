We reveal that the Zak phase of such plasmonic lattices is determined by the sign of the spatial average of their permittivity, \u03b5, and as such the topology and their associated interfacial (edge) states are extremely robust against structural disorder. Our study shows that the topologically protected interfacial modes occurring at the interface between two plasmonic lattices with opposite signs of \u03b5 can be viewed as the generalization of the conventional surface plasmon polaritons existing at metallic-dielectric interfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dielectric interface", "Dielectric layer", "Interfacial modes", "Spatial average", "Structural disorders", "Surface plasmon polaritons", "Topological properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988891189", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56650469000": {"Name": "Deng H.", "AuthorID": "56650469000", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "35239643800": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "35239643800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "23669646100": {"Name": "Ye F.", "AuthorID": "23669646100", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
