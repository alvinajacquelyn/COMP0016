Methods: We analyzed CSF concentrations of neurogranin, b-amyloid (Ab42), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) among 132 neurologically normal older adults (mean 64.5, range 55-85), along with bilateral hippocampal volumes and a measure of episodic memory (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, delayed recall). Univariable analyses examined the relationship between neurogranin and the other AD-related biomarkers. Multivariable regression models examined the relationship between neurogranin and delayed recall, adjusting for age and sex, and interaction terms (neurogranin 3 AD biomarkers). Results: Higher neurogranin concentrations were associated with older age (r 5 0.20, p 5 0.02), lower levels of p-tau and t-tau, and smaller hippocampal volumes (p>0.03), but not with CSF Ab42 (p 5 0.18). In addition, CSF neurogranin demonstrated a significant relationship with memory performance independent of the AD-related biomarkers; individuals with the lowest CSF neurogranin concentrations performed better on delayed recall than those with medium or high CSF neurogranin concentrations (p>0.01). Notably, CSF p-tau, t-tau, and Ab42 and hippocampal volumes were not significantly associated with delayed recall scores (p<0.40), and did not interact with neurogranin to predict memory (p<0.10).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Independent Living", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Neurogranin", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Peptide Fragments", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032190016", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56135574100": {"Name": "Casaletto K.B.", "AuthorID": "56135574100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "57090390300": {"Name": "Elahi F.M.", "AuthorID": "57090390300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "7005256475": {"Name": "Neuhaus J.", "AuthorID": "7005256475", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "57203071462": {"Name": "Yaffe K.", "AuthorID": "57203071462", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "San Francisco Veterans Affairs Hospital"}, "57219148089": {"Name": "Kramer J.H.", "AuthorID": "57219148089", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "14065892400": {"Name": "Bettcher B.M.", "AuthorID": "14065892400", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Denver Anschutz Medical Center, University of Colorado"}, "7103143605": {"Name": "Carlsson C.", "AuthorID": "7103143605", "AffiliationID": "60073942", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, William S.
