KGaA, WeinheimNanostructured V2O5 is emerging as a new cathode material for lithium ion batteries for its distinctly high theoretic capacity over the current commercial cathodes. The main challenges associated with nanostructured V2O5 cathodes are structural degradation, instability of the solid-electrolyte interface layer, and poor electron conductance, which lead to low capacity and rapid decay of cyclic stability. Here, a novel composite structure of V2O5 nanoparticles encapsulated in 3D networked porous carbon matrix coated on carbon fibers (V2O5/3DC-CFs) is reported that effectively addresses the mentioned problems. Remarkably, the V2O5/3DC-CF electrode exhibits excellent overall lithium-storage performance, including high Coulombic efficiency, excellent specific capacity, outstanding cycling stability and rate property. A reversible capacity of \u2248183 mA h g\u22121 is obtained at a high current density of 10 C, and the battery retains 185 mA h g\u22121 after 5000 cycles, which shows the best cycling stability reported to date among all reported cathodes of lithium ion batteries as per the knowledge. The outstanding overall properties of the V2O5/3DC-CF composite make it a promising cathode material of lithium ion batteries for the power-intensive energy storage applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D networked porous carbon matrix", "cathodes", "cycling stability", "solid-electrolyte interface", "V2O5 nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coulombic efficiency", "Cycling stability", "Electron conductance", "Energy storage applications", "High current densities", "Porous carbons", "Solid electrolyte interfaces", "Structural degradation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992448514", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"24475575100": {"Name": "Zou R.", "AuthorID": "24475575100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "57195589228": {"Name": "Liu Q.", "AuthorID": "57195589228", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "55308946900": {"Name": "Xu K.", "AuthorID": "55308946900", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "8242699400": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "8242699400", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "54882046300": {"Name": "Yuen M.F.", "AuthorID": "54882046300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.S.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Center, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Center, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
