Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are classified based on morphology and graded based on their proliferation rate as either well-differentiated low-grade (G1 to G2) neuroendocrine tumors (NET) or poorly differentiated high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). Recently, a new subgroup of well-differentiated high-grade pancreatic tumors (NET G3) has been defined. The GEP NEN G3 group consisting of both NEC and NET G3 has recently been shown to be a quite heterogeneous patient group concerning prognosis and treatment benefit, depending on factors such as the primary tumor site, differentiation, proliferation rate, and molecular alterations. In this review we discuss the existing data on diagnostics, treatment, and biomarkers in this patient group, the unmet needs, and the future perspectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neuroendocrine carcinoma", "Neuroendocrine neoplasm", "Neuroendocrine tumor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Biomedical Research", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Pancreatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060177166", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6701769027": {"Name": "Sorbye H.", "AuthorID": "6701769027", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Clinical Science, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "7005202739": {"Name": "Baudin E.", "AuthorID": "7005202739", "AffiliationID": "60106080", "AffiliationName": "Endocrine Oncology, Gustave Roussy"}, "8986695600": {"Name": "Borbath I.", "AuthorID": "8986695600", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "Hepato-Gastroenterology Unit, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57201262960": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "57201262960", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"}, "6602989744": {"Name": "Cwikla J.B.", "AuthorID": "6602989744", "AffiliationID": "60024421", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Warmia and Mazury"}, "56248644000": {"Name": "Frilling A.", "AuthorID": "56248644000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "35401342800": {"Name": "Grossman A.", "AuthorID": "35401342800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004156208": {"Name": "Kaltsas G.", "AuthorID": "7004156208", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57219651556": {"Name": "Scarpa A.", "AuthorID": "57219651556", "AffiliationID": "60060733", "AffiliationName": "ARC-Net Centre for Applied Research on Cancer, Section of Pathology, Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, University and Hospital Trust of Verona"}, "56274886700": {"Name": "Welin S.", "AuthorID": "56274886700", "AffiliationID": "60015216", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrine Oncology, Uppsala University Hospital"}, "6603544256": {"Name": "Garcia-Carbonero R.", "AuthorID": "6603544256", "AffiliationID": "60004024, 60027282, 60008948", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, CNIO, CIBERONC, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}}}
