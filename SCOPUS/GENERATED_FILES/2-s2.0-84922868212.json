There is suggestion that these expansions may be a rare cause of parkinsonian disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Screening the C9orf72 gene in 37 patients with features of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) detected an expansion in 3 patients, confirmed by Southern blotting. In a series of 22 patients with clinically diagnosed PSP, we found 1 patient with an intermediate repeat length. We also screened for the C9orf72 expansion in a large series of neuropathologically confirmed samples with MSA (n= 96), PSP (n= 177), and CBD (n= 18). Patients were found with no more than 22 GGGGCC repeats. Although these results still need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of CBS and/or CBD patients, these data suggest that in the presence of a family history and/or motor neuron disease features, patients with CBS or clinical PSP should be screened for the C9orf72 repeat expansion. In addition, we confirm that the C9orf72 expansions are not associated with pathologically confirmed MSA, PSP, or CBD in a large series of cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C9orf72", "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS)", "Multiple system atrophy (MSA)", "Parkinsonism", "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Basal Ganglia", "Basal Ganglia Diseases", "DNA Repeat Expansion", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Proteins", "Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive", "Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922868212", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"36911788600": {"Name": "Schottlaender L.V.", "AuthorID": "36911788600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8248290200": {"Name": "Polke J.M.", "AuthorID": "8248290200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Laboratory, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24781067400": {"Name": "Ling H.", "AuthorID": "24781067400", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, The Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36189161300": {"Name": "Tucci A.", "AuthorID": "36189161300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55965180800": {"Name": "Nanji T.", "AuthorID": "55965180800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Laboratory, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, The Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56230728900": {"Name": "de Silva R.", "AuthorID": "56230728900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, The Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.L.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, The Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102381695": {"Name": "Revesz T.", "AuthorID": "7102381695", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, The Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7201380026": {"Name": "Sweeney M.G.", "AuthorID": "7201380026", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Laboratory, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.J.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, The Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "The MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56401904500": {"Name": "MacDoanld N.D.", "AuthorID": "56401904500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "The MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.B.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, NIA, NIH"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "The Sobell Department of Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
