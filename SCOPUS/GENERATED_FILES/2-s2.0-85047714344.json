Later, behavioral medicine expanded to become defined as the interdisciplinary field concerned with the development and integration of social, behavioral, and biomedical science, knowledge and techniques relevant to health and illness, and the application of this knowledge to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation (Steptoe, 2010). Behavioral medicine has a distinct pedigree from psychosomatic medicine, since even though both are focused on psychological aspects of health, psychosomatics emerged from the psychodynamic tradition. However, the two fields have long been reconciled, so that the research described in behavioral medicine and psychosomatic conferences and journals is virtually interchangeable. The purpose of this chapter is to outline how psychophysiological knowledge is applied in behavioral medicine, focusing on two broad issues. First is the application of psychophysiology to understanding the etiology of physical illnesses such as coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, infectious illness, and musculoskeletal disorders. This is a field in which psychophysiological methods have deepened our understanding of physical disease development and maintenance. The second general issue is the application of psychophysiology to the management of physical illnesses, and the evaluation of treatment effects. Research in behavioral medicine has developed approaches to psychophysiology that differ to some extent from those that are commonly used in experimental psychology or neuroscience research. The chapter therefore begins with a summary of methodological issues relevant to the application of psychophysiology to behavioral medicine. METHODS OF STUDYING PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE Much of clinical medicine involves the measurement of biological functions. As psychophysiology has expanded beyond traditional measures such as heart rate and electrodermal activity to include hormonal, immunological, and even molecular variables, the dividing line between where clinical measurement ends and psychophysiology begins has become increasingly opaque. There are three broad applications of psychophysiology, each with its strengths and limitations, as summarized in Table 24.1.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047714344", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
