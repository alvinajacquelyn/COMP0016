A novel control volume finite element method with adaptive unstructured meshes is employed here to study 3-D breaking waves. The numerical framework consists of a \u201cvolume of fluid\u201d type method for the interface capturing and adaptive unstructured meshes to improve computational efficiency. The numerical model is validated against experimental measurements of breaking wave over a sloping beach and is then used to study the breaking wave impact on a vertical circular cylinder on a slope. Detailed complex interfacial structures during wave impact, such as plunging jet formation and splash-up are captured in the simulation, demonstrating the capability of the present method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3-D simulation", "adaptive unstructured mesh", "Breaking waves", "Navier-Stokes equation", "volume of fluid method"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D simulations", "Adaptive unstructured meshes", "Breaking wave impacts", "Breaking waves", "Control-volume finite element methods", "Interfacial structures", "Volume of fluid method", "Wave-structure interaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029101293", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"16235608000": {"Name": "Xie Z.", "AuthorID": "16235608000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "55286426300": {"Name": "Lu L.", "AuthorID": "55286426300", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60126533", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57204249025": {"Name": "Pavlidis D.", "AuthorID": "57204249025", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56654938000": {"Name": "Salinas P.", "AuthorID": "56654938000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7005917676": {"Name": "Pain C.C.", "AuthorID": "7005917676", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7004362683": {"Name": "Matar O.K.", "AuthorID": "7004362683", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55709975500": {"Name": "Lin J.g.", "AuthorID": "55709975500", "AffiliationID": "60029322", "AffiliationName": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Dalian Maritime University"}}}
