Participants were 607 women and 316 men (mean age 42 years) from the Young Finns Study who participated in three consecutive study phases in 2001, 2007 and 2012. Using Gene-set enrichment analyses (GSEA) we focused our analyses to pathways (available in MSigDB database) that are likely to affect immunological and inflammatory processes. GSEA were performed for blood cell GWE data in 2012. Depressive symptoms were assessed using a modified 21-item Beck Depression Inventory in each of the three study phases. Participants who scored in the top quartile of depressive symptoms in each of the three measurement points (n = 191) differed from other participants (n = 732) in several gene-set pathways related to inflammatory processes or immune-inflammatory signaling including interleukin (IL-1) pathway, and pathways related to various immuno-inflammatory processes, such as toll-like, the NEF protein, the nuclear factor kB, the kinase AKT and the mature B cell antigen receptor pathway (false discovery rates, FDRs < 0.12). The results provide novel genome wide molecular evidence that support the association between chronic depressive symptoms and altered immune-inflammatory regulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gene expression depression", "Gene set pathways", "Gene-set enrichment analyses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Finland", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945975501", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7003614400": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "7003614400", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "8402684300": {"Name": "Pulkki-R\u00e5back L.", "AuthorID": "8402684300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, University of Helsinki"}, "55347556900": {"Name": "Hakulinen C.", "AuthorID": "55347556900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "55921083600": {"Name": "Hintsa T.", "AuthorID": "55921083600", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "7005916684": {"Name": "Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen L.", "AuthorID": "7005916684", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "56938596600": {"Name": "Taipale T.", "AuthorID": "56938596600", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories and School of Medicine, University of Tampere"}, "54927389100": {"Name": "Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 I.", "AuthorID": "54927389100", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories and School of Medicine, University of Tampere"}, "57194222481": {"Name": "Mononen N.", "AuthorID": "57194222481", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories and School of Medicine, University of Tampere"}, "38663008300": {"Name": "Raitoharju E.", "AuthorID": "38663008300", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories and School of Medicine, University of Tampere"}, "7006539182": {"Name": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T.", "AuthorID": "7006539182", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories and School of Medicine, University of Tampere"}, "6701823086": {"Name": "Illig T.", "AuthorID": "6701823086", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School"}, "57197777520": {"Name": "Waldenberger M.", "AuthorID": "57197777520", "AffiliationID": "60024007", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit of Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health University College London"}, "7006708451": {"Name": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M.", "AuthorID": "7006708451", "AffiliationID": "60008760, 60011170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Tampere University Hospital and School of Medicine, University of Tampere"}, "7004828916": {"Name": "Raitakari O.", "AuthorID": "7004828916", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Turku"}}}
