The ability to track individuals in great spatial detail by means of Location Aware Technologies such as GPS has opened avenues for gathering these data with great precision. Route reconstruction with positional data is typically done by a process referred to as map-matching; however, despite the large number of real-time map-matching algorithms developed, few studies have developed a post-processing map-matching algorithm in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-environment. This paper presents two GIS-based map-matching methods that predominantly use a digital road network with speed and directionality attributes for route reconstruction of raw GPS-trajectories. The methodologies were tested for a data set in which actual routes travelled were known. Both explored procedures, the \u2018Connected Subset\u2019 assignment procedure based on network subset selection and the \u2018Impedance Reduction\u2019 assignment procedure based on attribute adjustment, provide accurate results. In addition, both procedures effectively deal with commonly GPS-induced problems such as measurement gaps and positional drift.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geographic Information Systems", "GPS", "post-processing map-matching", "Route reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021083453", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57213654087": {"Name": "Van Dijk J.", "AuthorID": "57213654087", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Logistics, Stellenbosch University"}, "23982183800": {"Name": "De Jong T.", "AuthorID": "23982183800", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Geosciences, Department of Human Geography and Planning, Utrecht University"}}}
