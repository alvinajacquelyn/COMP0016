Galerkin discretizations of the classical Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) boundary integral equation formulation provide accurate solutions for complex particle geometries, but are well-known to lead to ill-conditioned linear systems. In this paper we carry out an experimental investigation into the performance of Calder\u00f3n preconditioning techniques for single and multiple absorbing obstacles, which involve a squaring of the PMCHWT operator to produce a well-conditioned second-kind formulation. For single-particle scattering configurations we find that Calder\u00f3n preconditioning is actually often outperformed by simple \u201cmass-matrix\u201d preconditioning, i.e. working with the strong form of the discretized PMCHWT operator. In the case of scattering by multiple particles we find that a significant saving in computational cost can be obtained by performing block-diagonal Calder\u00f3n preconditioning in which only the self-interaction blocks are preconditioned. Using the boundary element software library Bempp (www.bempp.com) the numerical performance of the different methods is compared for a range of wavenumbers, particle geometries and complex refractive indices relevant to the scattering of light by atmospheric ice crystals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary element method", "Calder\u00f3n preconditioning", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Ice crystals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex refractive index", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Experimental investigations", "Homogeneous dielectrics", "Ice crystals", "Ill-conditioned linear systems", "Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai", "Preconditioning techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057765783", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"57194179348": {"Name": "Kleanthous A.", "AuthorID": "57194179348", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mathematics"}, "23102173100": {"Name": "Betcke T.", "AuthorID": "23102173100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mathematics"}, "36637487000": {"Name": "Hewett D.", "AuthorID": "36637487000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mathematics"}, "57192094932": {"Name": "Scroggs M.", "AuthorID": "57192094932", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mathematics"}, "7102591209": {"Name": "Baran A.", "AuthorID": "7102591209", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire, School of Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics"}}}
