In this study, we investigated its role in dementia using large clinical cohorts. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma albumin ratio (Qalb), an indicator of BBB (and blood-CSF barrier) permeability, was measured in a total of 1015 individuals. The ratio was increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson's disease dementia, subcortical vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia compared with controls. However, this measure was not changed during preclinical or prodromal Alzheimer's disease and was not associated with amyloid positron emission tomography or APOE genotype. The Qalb was increased in diabetes mellitus and correlated positively with CSF biomarkers of angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction (vascular endothelial growth factor, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). In healthy elderly, high body mass index and waist-hip ratio predicted increased Qalb 20 years later. In summary, BBB permeability is increased in major dementia disorders but does not relate to amyloid pathology or APOE genotype. Instead, BBB impairment may be associated with diabetes and brain microvascular damage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid", "APOE \u03b54", "Blood-brain barrier", "Dementia", "Diabetes", "Vascular pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Albumins", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Capillary Permeability", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Immunoglobulins", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Serum Albumin", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007609372", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57194936571": {"Name": "Janelidze S.", "AuthorID": "57194936571", "AffiliationID": "60118587, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences Malm\u00f6, Lund University"}, "36833683500": {"Name": "Hertze J.", "AuthorID": "36833683500", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "6603186101": {"Name": "N\u00e4gga K.", "AuthorID": "6603186101", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "35227764300": {"Name": "Nilsson C.", "AuthorID": "35227764300", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57212848727": {"Name": "Nilsson K.", "AuthorID": "57212848727", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57196399048": {"Name": "Wennstr\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "57196399048", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Wallenberg Laboratory"}, "55903276400": {"Name": "van Westen D.", "AuthorID": "55903276400", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Function, Sk\u00e5ne University Health Care"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
