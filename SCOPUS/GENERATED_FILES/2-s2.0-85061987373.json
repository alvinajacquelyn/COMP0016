We used a visual search task for a uniquely tilted oblique bar embedded in an object shape \u2018N\u2019 or in its mirror reversal \u2018\u0418\u2019. The accuracy and the averaged reaction times (RTs) in each stimulus type (\u2019N\u2019 or \u2018\u0418\u2019) were analysed. HC presented significantly longer RTs when the target bar was embedded in \u2018N\u2019 among its mirror reversed \u2018\u0418\u2019 (p <.05). This \u201creversed letter effect\u201d was also found in the right parietal patients (p <.001), while no evidence of a reversed letter effect was found in the left parietal patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Parietal cortex", "Top-down attention", "Visual search asymmetries"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attention", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Linguistics", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parietal Lobe", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061987373", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36137414400": {"Name": "Mangano G.R.", "AuthorID": "36137414400", "AffiliationID": "115161604", "AffiliationName": "NeuroTeam Life and Science"}, "6602456612": {"Name": "Turriziani P.", "AuthorID": "6602456612", "AffiliationID": "115161604", "AffiliationName": "NeuroTeam Life and Science"}, "57203282754": {"Name": "Giammusso I.", "AuthorID": "57203282754", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo"}, "6507588275": {"Name": "Smirni D.", "AuthorID": "6507588275", "AffiliationID": "115161604", "AffiliationName": "NeuroTeam Life and Science"}, "7007025909": {"Name": "Oliveri M.", "AuthorID": "7007025909", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation"}, "7004532494": {"Name": "Cipolotti L.", "AuthorID": "7004532494", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6602091539": {"Name": "Zhaoping L.", "AuthorID": "6602091539", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College"}, "57193099173": {"Name": "Bracco M.", "AuthorID": "57193099173", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow"}}}
