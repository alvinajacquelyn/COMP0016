However, predictors of long-term patterns of PA types into old age are unknown. This study aimed to identify 20-yr trajectories of PA types into old age and their predictors. Methods Seven thousand seven hundred thirty-five men (age, 40-59 yr) recruited from UK towns in 1978 to 1980 were followed up after 12, 16, and 20 yr. Men reported participation in sport/exercise, recreational activity and walking, health status, lifestyle behaviors and socio-demographic characteristics. Group-based trajectory modeling identified the trajectories of PA types and associations with time-stable and time-varying covariates. Results Men with \u22653 measures of sport/exercise (n = 5116), recreational activity (n = 5085) and walking (n = 5106) respectively were included in analyses. Three trajectory groups were identified for sport/exercise, four for recreational activity and three for walking. Poor health, obesity and smoking were associated with reduced odds of following a more favorable trajectory for all PA types. A range of socioeconomic, regional and lifestyle factors were also associated with PA trajectories but the magnitude and direction were specific to PA type. For example, men with manual occupations were less likely to follow a favorable sport/exercise trajectory but more likely to follow an increasing walking trajectory compared to men with nonmanual occupations. Retirement was associated with increased PA but this was largely due to increased sport/exercise participation. Conclusions Physical activity trajectories from middle to old age vary by activity type. The predictors of these trajectories and effects of major life events, such as retirement, are also specific to the type of PA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AGING", "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "EXERCISE", "RETIREMENT", "SPORT", "WALKING"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Exercise", "Health Behavior", "Health Status", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Sports", "United Kingdom", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058045370", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"55219956400": {"Name": "Aggio D.", "AuthorID": "55219956400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group"}, "6603773732": {"Name": "Papacosta O.", "AuthorID": "6603773732", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group"}, "53865343000": {"Name": "Papachristou E.", "AuthorID": "53865343000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}}}
