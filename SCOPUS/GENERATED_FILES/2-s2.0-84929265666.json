In this paper, we establish a thesis that suggests that funding programs (such as Marco Polo I and II) have not properly offered the right incentives to promote SSS, and aspects such as the key role of port infrastructure and its characteristics, have not been taken into consideration. In a departure from traditional transport cost models, to prove our thesis, we use a theoretical intermodal competition model to compare alternative modes\u2014road transport vs. SSS. We reach the conclusion that the EU needs to focus on ports and transport system efficiency as a whole in order to compete effectively in the freight transport market.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929265666", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55489923700": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Alem\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "55489923700", "AffiliationID": "60009669", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Economics, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"}, "7004592190": {"Name": "Trujillo L.", "AuthorID": "7004592190", "AffiliationID": "60009669", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Economics, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"}, "6603380130": {"Name": "Medda F.", "AuthorID": "6603380130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
