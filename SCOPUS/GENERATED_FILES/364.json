All rights reserved.Assessing Weight-of-Evidence for DNA Profiles is an excellent introductory text to the use of statistical analysis for assessing DNA evidence. It offers practical guidance to forensic scientists with little dependence on mathematical ability as the book includes background information on statistics - including likelihood ratios - population genetics, and courtroom issues. The author, who is highly experienced in this field, has illustrated the book throughout with his own experiences as well as providing a theoretical underpinning to the subject. It is an ideal choice for forensic scientists and lawyers, as well as statisticians and population geneticists with an interest in forensic science and DNA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948764034", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"7004169857": {"Name": "Balding D.", "AuthorID": "7004169857", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, London"}}}
