Methods: This was a feasibility two-arm randomised controlled trial. Participants were attendees with advanced cancer at one of three hospice-based day-therapy units in London, United Kingdom, who demonstrated low scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapies\u2014General (FACT-G). The primary end point was 3 months. Results: The recruitment target was 54 participants; 42 people were recruited and randomised to up to eight individual sessions of ACT (n = 20) or TC (n = 22). Eighteen out of 42 (43%) of participants completed the primary outcome at 3 months, and at least one follow-up was available in 30/42 (71%) participants. An exploratory analysis revealed a non-significant adjusted mean difference after 3 months in the main outcome FACT-G of \u22123.41 (CI = \u221218.61-11.79) with TC having better functioning. Over 6 months, the adjusted mean difference between trial arms was 2.25 (CI = \u22126.03-10.52) in favour of ACT. Conclusions: It is feasible to recruit people with advanced cancer in a trial of ACT versus TC. Future research should test the effectiveness of ACT in a fully powered trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acceptance and commitment therapy", "cancer", "feasibility", "oncology", "palliative", "randomised controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acceptance and Commitment Therapy", "Adult", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Patient Compliance", "Patient Satisfaction", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059018551", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57211248716": {"Name": "Serfaty M.", "AuthorID": "57211248716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56779544500": {"Name": "Armstrong M.", "AuthorID": "56779544500", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St. Pancras Hospital"}, "55576291300": {"Name": "Vickerstaff V.", "AuthorID": "55576291300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57211183430": {"Name": "Davis S.", "AuthorID": "57211183430", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56226371200": {"Name": "Gola A.", "AuthorID": "56226371200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57023447800": {"Name": "McNamee P.", "AuthorID": "57023447800", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St. Pancras Hospital"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7403623810": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "7403623810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56030351700": {"Name": "Low J.T.S.", "AuthorID": "56030351700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7005718930": {"Name": "Omar R.Z.", "AuthorID": "7005718930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6603075489": {"Name": "Tookman A.", "AuthorID": "6603075489", "AffiliationID": "109965318", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Hospice Hampstead"}}}
