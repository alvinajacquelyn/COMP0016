The involvement of rarer variants in these loci has been poorly studied. Using International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium data sets, we performed a comprehensive study to determine the impact of rare variants in 23 previously published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci in PD. We applied Prix fixe to select the putative causal genes underneath the GWAS peaks, which was based on underlying functional similarities. The Sequence Kernel Association Test was used to analyze the joint effect of rare, common, or both types of variants on PD susceptibility. All genes were tested simultaneously as a gene set and each gene individually. We observed a moderate association of common variants, confirming the involvement of the known PD risk loci within our genetic data sets. Focusing on rare variants, we identified additional association signals for LRRK2, STBD1, and SPATA19. Our study suggests an involvement of rare variants within several putatively causal genes underneath previously identified PD GWAS peaks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Common risk loci", "Parkinson's disease", "Rare variants", "Variant aggregation test", "Whole exome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Datasets as Topic", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Membrane Proteins", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Muscle Proteins", "Parkinson Disease", "Risk", "Seminal Plasma Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028503483", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"54397154500": {"Name": "Jansen I.E.", "AuthorID": "54397154500", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "Genome Biology of Neurodegenerative Diseases, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7005566654": {"Name": "Heutink P.", "AuthorID": "7005566654", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genetic Epidemiology, Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "16028171700": {"Name": "Gibbs J.R.", "AuthorID": "16028171700", "AffiliationID": "60017252", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging"}, "55630773200": {"Name": "Nalls M.A.", "AuthorID": "55630773200", "AffiliationID": "118431800", "AffiliationName": "Data Tecnica International"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.B.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging"}, "56785180900": {"Name": "Price T.R.", "AuthorID": "56785180900", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "University California Irvine"}, "15053483700": {"Name": "Lubbe S.", "AuthorID": "15053483700", "AffiliationID": "60013227", "AffiliationName": "Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}, "57202758297": {"Name": "van Rooij J.", "AuthorID": "57202758297", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC"}, "35231615000": {"Name": "Uitterlinden A.G.", "AuthorID": "35231615000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC"}, "57204683110": {"Name": "Kraaij R.", "AuthorID": "57204683110", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC"}, "7402772034": {"Name": "Williams N.M.", "AuthorID": "7402772034", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University"}, "56401594400": {"Name": "Brice A.", "AuthorID": "56401594400", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, H\u00f4pital de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique et Cytog\u00e9n\u00e9tique"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute, University College London"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.W.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35519668300": {"Name": "Gasser T.", "AuthorID": "35519668300", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genetic Epidemiology, Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "57202974421": {"Name": "Sharma M.", "AuthorID": "57202974421", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genetic Epidemiology, Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
