Although these interactions may rule the features of an infracommunity and may shape the infracommunity response to external perturbations, the resilience of ectoparasite communities to new infestations remains poorly explored. Methods: We analysed the composition of the ectoparasite communities found on 214 individual Iberian ibexes (Capra pyrenaica) inhabiting the Sierra Nevada Natural Space, southern Spain. Using classification and regression trees, we explored how the presence of Sarcoptes scabiei (a highly contagious mite), the off-host environment and the host sex govern the prevalence and abundance of lice and ticks. Null model analysis was applied to assess the impact of S. scabiei on the structure of the ectoparasite communities. Results: Our results suggest that S. scabiei infestation acts in tandem with off-host environment and host sex to define the prevalence and abundance of lice and ticks. We also provided evidence for differences in species co-occurrence only at the early stages of S. scabiei infestation. Regarding species diversity, we recorded that ectoparasite communities in scabietic ibexes reached a high richness faster than those in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Even though we show that ectoparasite burden is correlated with S. scabiei infestation, off-host environment and host sex, the species response to S. scabiei infestation and climate seem to be highly variable and influenced by ectoparasite life-history traits. Ectoparasite communities also appear resilient to perturbations which is in agreement with what was previously reported for endoparasites. Future refinement of sample collection and the incorporation of ecological and epidemiological-related variables may allow us to establish causal effects and deepen the knowledge about the mechanisms and consequences of ectoparasite interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capra pyrenaica", "Community ecology", "Ecosystem engineer", "Multiparasitism", "Sarcoptes scabiei"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Coinfection", "Ecosystem", "Female", "Goat Diseases", "Goats", "Lice Infestations", "Male", "Phthiraptera", "Prevalence", "Sarcoptes scabiei", "Scabies", "Sex Factors", "Spain", "Tick Infestations", "Ticks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976565030", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55936459800": {"Name": "Carvalho J.", "AuthorID": "55936459800", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Servei d'Ecopatologia de Fauna Salvatge (SEFaS), Departament de Medicina i Cirurgia Animals, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "7103238419": {"Name": "Serrano E.", "AuthorID": "7103238419", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Servei d'Ecopatologia de Fauna Salvatge (SEFaS), Departament de Medicina i Cirurgia Animals, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "7004665975": {"Name": "Fonseca C.", "AuthorID": "7004665975", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, CESAM, University of Aveiro"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7007014686": {"Name": "Granados J.E.", "AuthorID": "7007014686", "AffiliationID": "115733539", "AffiliationName": "Espacio Natural de Sierra Nevada"}, "14032972500": {"Name": "Habela M.A.", "AuthorID": "14032972500", "AffiliationID": "60017838", "AffiliationName": "Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases Animal Health Department, Veterinary Faculty, University of Extremadura"}, "57190020586": {"Name": "Olmeda S.", "AuthorID": "57190020586", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Sanidad Animal, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "7403417042": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez J.M.", "AuthorID": "7403417042", "AffiliationID": "60014586", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Animal, Biolog\u00eda Vegetal y Ecolog\u00eda, Universidad de Ja\u00e9n"}}}
