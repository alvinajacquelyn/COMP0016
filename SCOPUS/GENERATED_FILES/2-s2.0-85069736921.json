The use of micro devices for liquid-liquid extraction of radionuclides is promising, since small amounts of materials are needed. In this work, a plug flow modelling approach for the liquid-liquid extraction in microdevices is presented. A multi-component chemical process based on the PUREX-TRUEX waste management treatment is analysed. We evaluate the performance of the coupled micro-units as a function of channel size, superficial mixture velocity, and initial loading. The results show that it is possible to use the model in an optimisation based design procedure for microfluidic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Microdevices", "Plug flow", "Radionuclides", "Sensor design"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069736921", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57196986476": {"Name": "Pineda M.", "AuthorID": "57196986476", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CPSE and ThAMeS Multiphase.
