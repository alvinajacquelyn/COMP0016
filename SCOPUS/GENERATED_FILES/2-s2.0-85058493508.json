At present, the data acquired by PET and MR scanners are essentially processed separately, andthe search for ways to improve accuracy of the tomographicreconstruction via synergy of the two imaging techniques is an active areaof research. The aim of the collaborative computational project on PET and MR (CCP-PETMR), supported by the UK engineering and physical sciences research council (EPSRC), is to accelerate research in synergistic PET-MR image reconstruction by providing an open access software platform for efficient implementation and validation of novel reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we present the first release of the Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework (SIRF) software suite from the CCP-PETMR. SIRF provides user-friendly Python and MATLAB interfaces to advanced PET and MR reconstruction packages written in C}+ \\quad +textbf{{(currently this uses STIR, Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction, for PET and Gadgetron for MR, but SIRF will be able to link to other reconstruction engines in the future as appropriate). The software is capable of reconstructing images from real scanner data. Both of the available integrated clinical PET-MR systems (Siemens and GE) are being targeted, and a suitable dataformat exchange is being negotiated with the manufacturers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Positron Emission Tomography", "Research Software Engineering", "Scientific Programming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Efficient implementation", "Engineering and physical sciences research councils", "Patient management", "Positron emission tomography (PET)", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Reconstruction frameworks", "Scientific programming", "Software for tomographic image reconstruction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058493508", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"6603105853": {"Name": "Ovtchinnikov E.", "AuthorID": "6603105853", "AffiliationID": "60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "Visual Analytics and Imaging Systems Group, Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory Science and Technology Facilities Council"}, "57204053877": {"Name": "Pasca E.", "AuthorID": "57204053877", "AffiliationID": "60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "Visual Analytics and Imaging Systems Group, Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory Science and Technology Facilities Council"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "26221243500": {"Name": "Kolbitsch C.", "AuthorID": "26221243500", "AffiliationID": "60010962", "AffiliationName": "Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Braunschweig and Berlin"}, "36971045500": {"Name": "Thomas B.A.", "AuthorID": "36971045500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "57209809150": {"Name": "Fowler R.", "AuthorID": "57209809150", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "57204893983": {"Name": "Wadhwa P.", "AuthorID": "57204893983", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "57205073110": {"Name": "Emond E.", "AuthorID": "57205073110", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "7403215494": {"Name": "Turner M.", "AuthorID": "7403215494", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "57076776500": {"Name": "Bertolli O.", "AuthorID": "57076776500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57205079732": {"Name": "Da Costa-Luis C.O.", "AuthorID": "57205079732", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "7005446767": {"Name": "Reader A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005446767", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "15821657900": {"Name": "Efthimiou N.", "AuthorID": "15821657900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60030469", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London and School of Biological, Biomedical and Environmental Sciences, University of Hull"}, "7402837445": {"Name": "Matthews J.", "AuthorID": "7402837445", "AffiliationID": "60172345, 60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Sciences, MAHSC University of Manchester"}, "35337695700": {"Name": "Prieto C.", "AuthorID": "35337695700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "23480821300": {"Name": "Tsoumpas C.", "AuthorID": "23480821300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Imaging, University of Leeds and Imanova Ltd"}}}
