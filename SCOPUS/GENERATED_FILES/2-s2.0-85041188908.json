We report a high-throughput screening procedure that uses compositional descriptors to search for new photoactive semiconducting compounds. We show how feeding high-ranking element combinations to structure prediction algorithms can constitute a pragmatic computer-aided materials design approach. Techniques based on structural analogy (data mining of known lattice types) and global searches (direct optimisation using evolutionary algorithms) are combined for translating between chemical composition and crystal structure. The properties of four novel chalcohalides (Sn5S4Cl2, Sn4SF6, Cd5S4Cl2 and Cd4SF6) are predicted, of which two are calculated to have bandgaps in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical compositions", "Computational materials science", "Computer aided materials design", "Electromagnetic spectra", "High throughput screening", "Semiconducting compounds", "Structural analogies", "Structure prediction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041188908", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57192819463": {"Name": "Davies D.", "AuthorID": "57192819463", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "55423351000": {"Name": "Butler K.", "AuthorID": "55423351000", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "55314888200": {"Name": "Skelton J.", "AuthorID": "55314888200", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "55871493500": {"Name": "Xie C.", "AuthorID": "55871493500", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology on Thermostructural Composite Materials Laboratory, International Center for Materials Discovery, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University"}, "6701334785": {"Name": "Oganov A.", "AuthorID": "6701334785", "AffiliationID": "60000308", "AffiliationName": "Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology"}, "35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}}}
