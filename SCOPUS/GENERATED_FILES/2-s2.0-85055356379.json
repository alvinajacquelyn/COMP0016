It builds on the existing characteristics of textiles, fashion and garment design, and combines the design process with the scientific insights of MAGICSHOES project. The research question guiding MAGICSHOES whether body-tracking and sound-based wearable technology could be used to alter self-perception and in turn reduce physical inactivity, offers an interesting opportunity to explore further the space in between textiles and wearable computing. When garments start to sense and actuate to trigger certain behaviours, the clothing's inside is not anymore only about hiding seams, it gains a whole new dimension. The inside becomes a more important agent than the outside, in influencing how the wearer feels, how he/she perceives the outside world, and how he/she perceives being perceived by others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body perception", "Clothing", "E-textiles", "Fashion", "HCI.", "Multisensory perception", "Self perception", "Smart textiles", "Tactile arrays", "Vibration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body perceptions", "Clothing", "Fashion", "Multisensory perceptions", "Tactile arrays", "Vibration"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055356379", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56277963800": {"Name": "Kuusk K.", "AuthorID": "56277963800", "AffiliationID": "60104895", "AffiliationName": "Estonian Academy of Arts"}, "23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60001741", "AffiliationName": "DEI Interactive Systems Group, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"}, "15133296000": {"Name": "V\u00e4ljam\u00e4e A.", "AuthorID": "15133296000", "AffiliationID": "60068864", "AffiliationName": "Human Computer Interaction Group, Tallinn University"}}}
