Examples are used to illustrate how decisions about boundaries for a review are formed via an iterative process of constructing lines of inquiry and mapping the available information to ascertain whether evidence exists to answer questions related to effectiveness, implementation, feasibility, appropriateness, economic evidence, and equity. The process of question formulation allows reviewers to situate the topic in relation to how it informs and explains effectiveness, using the criterion of meaningfulness, appropriateness, feasibility, and implementation. Questions related to complex questions and interventions can be structured by drawing on an increasingly wide range of question frameworks. Logic models and theoretical frameworks are useful tools for conceptually mapping the literature to illustrate the complexity of the phenomenon of interest. Furthermore, protocol development may require iterative question formulation and searching. Consequently, the final protocol may function as a guide rather than a prescriptive route map, particularly in qualitative reviews that ask more exploratory and open-ended questions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cochrane collaboration", "Methods", "Protocol development", "Qualitative evidence synthesis", "Question formulation", "Systematic reviews"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Delivery of Health Care", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Qualitative Research", "Research Design", "Systematic Reviews as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040533732", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"55474573900": {"Name": "Harris J.L.", "AuthorID": "55474573900", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield"}, "7201728351": {"Name": "Booth A.", "AuthorID": "7201728351", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield"}, "6603037904": {"Name": "Cargo M.", "AuthorID": "6603037904", "AffiliationID": "60031846, 60108899", "AffiliationName": "Spatial Epidemiology & Evaluation Research Group/Centre for Population Health Research, University of South Australia"}, "55881625400": {"Name": "Hannes K.", "AuthorID": "55881625400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Social Research Methodology Group, Centre for Sociological Research, Faculty of Social Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "7005196568": {"Name": "Harden A.", "AuthorID": "7005196568", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "The University of East London, Stratford Campus"}, "14011917200": {"Name": "Flemming K.", "AuthorID": "14011917200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of York"}, "7003819360": {"Name": "Garside R.", "AuthorID": "7003819360", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60028495", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment & Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "16639001000": {"Name": "Pantoja T.", "AuthorID": "16639001000", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "55574208406": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208406", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57203175703": {"Name": "Noyes J.", "AuthorID": "57203175703", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences, Bangor University"}}}
