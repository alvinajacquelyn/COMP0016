Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in MedicinePurpose: Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an established specialist method for imaging the upper abdomen and biliary/pancreatic ducts. Due to limitations of either MR image contrast or low through-plane resolution, patients may require further evaluation with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. However, CT fails to offer the high tissue-ductal-vessel contrast-to-noise ratio available on T2-weighted MR imaging. Methods: MR super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) frameworks have the potential to provide high-resolution visualizations from multiple low through-plane resolution single-shot T2-weighted (SST2W) images as currently used during MRCP studies. Here, we (i) optimize the source image acquisition protocols by establishing the ideal number and orientation of SST2W series for MRCP SRR generation, (ii) optimize post-processing protocols for two motion correction candidate frameworks for MRCP SRR, and (iii) perform an extensive validation of the overall potential of upper abdominal SRR, using four expert readers with subspeciality interest in hepato-pancreatico-biliary imaging. Results: Obtained SRRs show demonstrable advantages over traditional SST2W MRCP data in terms of anatomical clarity and subjective radiologists\u2019 preference scores for a range of anatomical regions that are especially critical for the management of cancer patients. Conclusions: Our results underline the potential of using SRR alongside traditional MRCP data for improved clinical diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "MRCP", "slice-to-volume registration", "super resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Cholangiopancreatography", "Contrast to noise ratio", "High Resolution Visualization", "MRCP", "Super resolution", "Super resolution reconstruction", "Volume registration", "Abdomen", "Adult", "Brain", "Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Pilot Projects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068533565", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57193152354": {"Name": "Ebner M.", "AuthorID": "57193152354", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "56957582400": {"Name": "Patel P.A.", "AuthorID": "56957582400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "57209719262": {"Name": "Caselton L.", "AuthorID": "57209719262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "37030876800": {"Name": "Firmin L.", "AuthorID": "37030876800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "22937229800": {"Name": "Amin Z.", "AuthorID": "22937229800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "12794809100": {"Name": "Chouhan M.D.", "AuthorID": "12794809100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}}}
