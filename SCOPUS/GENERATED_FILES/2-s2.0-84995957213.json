NMR in Biomedicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Quantifying muscle water T2 (T2-water) independently of intramuscular fat content is essential in establishing T2-water as an outcome measure for imminent new therapy trials in neuromuscular diseases. IDEAL-CPMG combines chemical shift fat\u2013water separation with T2 relaxometry to obtain such a measure. Here we evaluate the reproducibility and B1 sensitivity of IDEAL-CPMG T2-water and fat fraction (f.f.) values in healthy subjects, and demonstrate the potential of the method to quantify T2-water variation in diseased muscle displaying varying degrees of fatty infiltration. The calf muscles of 11 healthy individuals (40.5 \u00b1 10.2 years) were scanned twice at 3 T with an inter-scan interval of 4 weeks using IDEAL-CPMG, and 12 patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) (42.3 \u00b1 11.5 years) were also imaged. An exponential was fitted to the signal decay of the separated water and fat components to determine T2-water and the fat signal amplitude muscle regions manually segmented. Overall mean calf-level muscle T2-water in healthy subjects was 31.2 \u00b1 2.0 ms, without significant inter-muscle differences (p = 0.37). Inter-subject and inter-scan coefficients of variation were 5.7% and 3.2% respectively for T2-water and 41.1% and 15.4% for f.f. Bland\u2013Altman mean bias and \u00b195% coefficients of repeatability were for T2-water (0.15, \u22122.65, 2.95) ms and f.f. (\u22120.02, \u22121.99, 2.03)%. There was no relationship between T2-water (\u03c1 = 0.16, p = 0.07) or f.f. (\u03c1 = 0.03, p = 0.7761) and B1 error or any correlation between T2-water and f.f. in the healthy subjects (\u03c1 = 0.07, p = 0.40). In HypoPP there was a measurable relationship between T2-water and f.f. (\u03c1 = 0.59, p < 0.001). IDEAL-CPMG provides a feasible way to quantify T2-water in muscle that is reproducible and sensitive to meaningful physiological changes without post hoc modeling of the fat contribution. In patients, IDEAL-CPMG measured elevations in T2-water and f.f. while showing a weak relationship between these parameters, thus showing promise as a practical means of quantifying muscle water in patient populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HypoPP", "IDEAL-CPMG", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Muscle", "Musculoskeletal", "Neuromuscular diseases", "Relaxometry", "Water fat imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["HypoPP", "IDEAL-CPMG", "Musculoskeletal", "Neuromuscular disease", "Relaxometry", "Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Body Water", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Weakness", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995957213", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"9844791700": {"Name": "Sinclair C.", "AuthorID": "9844791700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Neuroradiological Academic Unit"}, "38361922200": {"Name": "Morrow J.", "AuthorID": "38361922200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "55912945100": {"Name": "Evans M.", "AuthorID": "55912945100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Neuroradiological Academic Unit"}, "35316314600": {"Name": "Thornton J.", "AuthorID": "35316314600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Neuroradiological Academic Unit"}, "56254398500": {"Name": "Rawah E.", "AuthorID": "56254398500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Neuroradiological Academic Unit"}, "7403887736": {"Name": "Shah S.", "AuthorID": "7403887736", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Neuroradiological Academic Unit"}, "8627091000": {"Name": "Janiczek R.", "AuthorID": "8627091000", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
