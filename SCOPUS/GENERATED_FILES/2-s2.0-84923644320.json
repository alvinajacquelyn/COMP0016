Design: We used longitudinally linked administrative hospital data (Hospital Episode Statistics) to identify participants aged 10 -19 years with emergency admissions for injury (including day cases lasting more than 4 h) in England in 1998-2011. We used the Office for National Statistics mid-year estimates for population denominators. Results: Approximately 4.3% (n=141 248) of adolescents in the general population (n=3 254 046) had one or more emergency admissions for adversityrelated injury (girls 4.6%, boys 4.1%), accounting for 50% of all emergency admissions for injury in girls and 29.1% in boys. Admissions for self-harm or drug or alcohol misuse commonly occurred in the same girls and boys. Recurrent emergency admissions for injury were more common in adolescents with adversity-related injury (girls 17.3%, boys 16.5%) than in those with accident-related injury only (girls 4.7%, boys 7.4%), particularly for adolescents with adversityrelated injury related to multiple types of adversity (girls 21.1%, boys 24.2%). Conclusions: Hospital-based interventions should be developed to reduce the risk of future injury in adolescents admitted for adversity-related injury.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accidents", "Adolescent", "Child", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "England", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Admission", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Violence", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923644320", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"54781429100": {"Name": "Herbert A.", "AuthorID": "54781429100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7401932225": {"Name": "Gilbert R.", "AuthorID": "7401932225", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "24066757700": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Izquierdo A.", "AuthorID": "24066757700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "55605020600": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "55605020600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Institute of Child Health"}}}
