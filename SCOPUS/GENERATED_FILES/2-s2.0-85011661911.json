This algorithm employs zero-crossing rate to detect the disturbance starting point, and then utilizes an improved empirical mode decomposition to obtain the effective time-frequency distribution of the extracted signal. In the end, a cross-correlation is used to estimate the time delay of the effective extracted signal. The scheme is also verified and analyzed experimentally. The field test results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a detection of 96.60% of positioning errors distributed within the range of 0 - \u00b120m at the sensing length of 75 km, which significantly improves the positioning accuracy for the long-range asymmetric fence perimeter application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetric dual Mach-Zehnder interferometer (ADMZI)", "empirical mode decomposition (EMD)", "fiber optic distributed sensor", "positioning algorithm", "signal analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross correlations", "Dual mach-zehnder interferometers", "Empirical Mode Decomposition", "Fiber optic distributed sensors", "Perimeter security systems", "Positioning accuracy", "Positioning algorithms", "Zero crossing rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011661911", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56312489800": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "56312489800", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57146293900": {"Name": "Tian M.", "AuthorID": "57146293900", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "7404828963": {"Name": "Jiang J.", "AuthorID": "7404828963", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "55863151900": {"Name": "Ma C.", "AuthorID": "55863151900", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "56256320600": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "56256320600", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57190982625": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57190982625", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57193215046": {"Name": "Zheng W.", "AuthorID": "57193215046", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57189849913": {"Name": "Xue M.", "AuthorID": "57189849913", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57193213474": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "57193213474", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "7405910538": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "7405910538", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57193208305": {"Name": "An J.", "AuthorID": "57193208305", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "55863823300": {"Name": "Pan L.", "AuthorID": "55863823300", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "College of Precision Instrument and Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
