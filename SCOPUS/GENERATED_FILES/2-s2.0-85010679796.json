Of particular relevance, especially for serviceability limit state (SLS) design, has been the understanding of soils\u2019 small strain behaviour. For the behaviour of London Clay, initially developed models were simple curve-fitting techniques that reproduce stiffness dependence on stress and strain level, which has shown some successes in predicting SLS behaviours. Modelling failure of London Clay is significantly more complex due to its overconsolidated and fissured nature. More recent developments in soil constitutive modelling have therefore tried to encompass most important aspects of clay behaviour within the unified framework of critical state. However, even these advanced models have insufficient features to simulate the behaviour of overconsolidated clays. In this paper, a study has been made, comparing high quality laboratory triaxial data on London Clay with the predictions of two constitutive models, highlighting these deficiencies. It is shown how relatively simple modifications of advanced models, to capture the anisotropy of small strain stiffness and to impose a strength curtailment to represent strain localisation, can significantly improve the predictions of laboratory experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geotechnical engineering", "Mathematical modeling", "Strength & testing of materials"], "IndexKeywords": ["Curve fitting technique", "Geotechnical structure", "Laboratory experiments", "Overconsolidated clays", "Serviceability limit state", "Simple modifications", "Small-strain stiffness", "Soil constitutive model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010679796", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"8971608500": {"Name": "Yeow H.", "AuthorID": "8971608500", "AffiliationID": "60107260, 60099927", "AffiliationName": "COWI, Arup Geotechnics"}, "12243933700": {"Name": "Coop M.", "AuthorID": "12243933700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Imperial College London"}}}
