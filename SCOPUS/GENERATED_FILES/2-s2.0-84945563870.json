Aims: This study investigated the relationships between reading, speechreading and vocabulary in a large cohort of deaf and hearing children aged 5 to 14 years. Methods and procedures: 86 severely and profoundly deaf children and 91 hearing children participated in this study. All children completed assessments of reading comprehension, word reading accuracy, speechreading and vocabulary. Outcomes and results: Regression analyses showed that vocabulary and speechreading accounted for unique variance in both reading accuracy and comprehension for deaf children. For hearing children, vocabulary was an independent predictor of both reading accuracy and comprehension skills but speechreading only accounted for unique variance in reading accuracy. Conclusions and implications: Speechreading and vocabulary are important for reading development in deaf children. The results are interpreted within the Simple View of Reading framework and the theoretical implications for deaf children's reading are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deaf", "Reading", "Speechreading", "Vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Correction of Hearing Impairment", "Deafness", "Education of Hearing Disabled", "Female", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Language Tests", "Lipreading", "Male", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Phonetics", "Reading", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Vocabulary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945563870", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"6603065051": {"Name": "Kyle F.", "AuthorID": "6603065051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre (DCAL), Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, UCL"}, "55744483000": {"Name": "Campbell R.", "AuthorID": "55744483000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre (DCAL), Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, UCL"}, "6602263850": {"Name": "MacSweeney M.", "AuthorID": "6602263850", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL"}}}
