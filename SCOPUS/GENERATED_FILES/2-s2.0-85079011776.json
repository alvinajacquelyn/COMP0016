A behavioural programme may fail to change or have no significant impact on the frequency or severity of a target behaviour whilst it is in operation. The response cost approach can be said to constitute an ameliorative strategy to compensate for impairment of frontal lobe functioning. Considering the cognitive deficits and learning problems produced by brain injury, such criticisms have serious implications for the value of using behavioural techniques with sub group of patients. The application of behavioural techniques to brain injury rehabilitation have led to the emergence of methods for controlling or reducing post-traumatic behavioural sequelae, allowing therapies aimed at increasing functional independence to take place.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079011776", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7003570399": {"Name": "Alderman N.", "AuthorID": "7003570399", "AffiliationID": "60015557", "AffiliationName": "St. Andrew\u2019s Hospital"}, "7101747722": {"Name": "Burgess P.W.", "AuthorID": "7101747722", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "M.R.C.
