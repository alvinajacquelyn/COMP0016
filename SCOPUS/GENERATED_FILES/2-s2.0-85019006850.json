In spite of some promising early evidence on the benefits of BIM, the momentum of this top-down drive should build upon after-implementation empirical evidence. Through the structural equation modeling analysis of survey returns from 145 Chinese BIM-enabled projects, this research demonstrates that BIM's degree of implementation can positively affect the acceptability of integrated project delivery (IPD) in the future via increased perception of the need for supply chain incentivization and improved communication quality enabled by BIM. Rolling out BIM on a wider scale may yield an additional benefit in lowering the barrier to the implementation of IPD systems. This finding can serve as evidential support for government mandates that require the compulsory adoption of BIM in public projects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building information modeling", "Collaboration", "Incentivization", "Information technologies", "Integrated project delivery", "Structural equation modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Model - BIM", "Collaboration", "Incentivization", "Integrated project deliveries", "Structural equation modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019006850", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Industrial Relations", "BUSI", "1410"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"7407042094": {"Name": "Chang C.Y.", "AuthorID": "7407042094", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Infrastructure Center, Univ.
