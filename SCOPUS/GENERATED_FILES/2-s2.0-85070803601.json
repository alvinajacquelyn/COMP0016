Cross-sectional analyses are from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We extracted and aggregated data on HIV antibody test, socio-demographic characteristics, alcohol use, drug use, depression, sexual behaviours and sexually transmitted diseases from cycle 2009\u20132010 to 2015\u20132016. We carried out weighted regression among young adults (20\u201339 years) and adults (40\u201359 years) separately. In total, 5230 men and 5794 women aged 20\u201359 years were included in the present analyses. In total, 0.8% men and 0.2% women were tested HIV-positive. Each increasing HIV risk behaviour was associated with elevated odds of being tested HIV-positive (1.15, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.15) among young adults and adults (1.61, 95% CI 1.61\u20131.61). Multi-faceted, community-based interventions are urgently required to reduce the incidence of HIV in the USA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adults", "HIV", "NHANES", "Risk factors", "Syndemic theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Nutrition Surveys", "Prevalence", "Risk Assessment", "Risk-Taking", "Sex Distribution", "Sexual Partners", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Syndemic", "United States", "Unsafe Sex", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070803601", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57205476718": {"Name": "Cao C.", "AuthorID": "57205476718", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57204764662": {"Name": "Zong X.", "AuthorID": "57204764662", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "26327022900": {"Name": "McDermott D.T.", "AuthorID": "26327022900", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology, School of Psychology and Sports Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "55965038600": {"Name": "Stefanac S.", "AuthorID": "55965038600", "AffiliationID": "109593890", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Arthritis and Rehabilitation"}, "55883251200": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "55883251200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Center for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55965585000": {"Name": "Grabovac I.", "AuthorID": "55965585000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Center for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch"}, "56371435100": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez G.F.", "AuthorID": "56371435100", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Murcia"}, "57197741912": {"Name": "Koyanagi A.", "AuthorID": "57197741912", "AffiliationID": "60104561", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Fundaci\u00f3 Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, CIBERSAM, Sant Boi de Llobregat"}, "57189045362": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57189045362", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Center for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
