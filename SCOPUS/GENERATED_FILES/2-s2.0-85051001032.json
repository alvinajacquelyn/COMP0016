The aim of this methodology was to assess the perceived impacts of two infrastructure interventions for flood mitigation (local drainage improvement and local flood protection by gabions along the river edges) in the Andolo community in Kibera, Nairobi, in Kenya. Future Scenario Planning was used as a visualisation method for the changes each intervention could bring to the community and the perceived impacts were measured using the assets component of the British Department for International Development (DFID)'s Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. The exercise was delivered as a two-day workshop, which ensured community engagement and facilitated co-decision making of an infrastructure intervention. The process was helpful to ensure sustainability in the use and maintenance of a public space, as well as for initiating conversations within the community regarding critical infrastructure and prioritisation of interventions for mitigating immediate risks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assets", "Flood mitigation", "Flooding", "Infrastructure", "Kibera", "Scenario planning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051001032", "SubjectAreas": [["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57188690313": {"Name": "Garfias Royo M.", "AuthorID": "57188690313", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "26031677400": {"Name": "Parikh P.", "AuthorID": "26031677400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57203244827": {"Name": "Mutwiri F.", "AuthorID": "57203244827", "AffiliationID": "110023920", "AffiliationName": "Kounkuey Design Initiative"}, "57194170516": {"Name": "Harper J.", "AuthorID": "57194170516", "AffiliationID": "110023920", "AffiliationName": "Kounkuey Design Initiative"}, "57194117086": {"Name": "Bukachi V.", "AuthorID": "57194117086", "AffiliationID": "110023920", "AffiliationName": "Kounkuey Design Initiative"}, "37034719100": {"Name": "Mulligan J.", "AuthorID": "37034719100", "AffiliationID": "110023920", "AffiliationName": "Kounkuey Design Initiative"}}}
