As this is seen as inadequate, there is a need for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). In this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for NSHL and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. One-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive NSHL (arNSHL) patients of Western-European ethnicity were analyzed for SNVs, Indels, and CNVs. In addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. We estimate that combining prescreening of GJB2 with our panel leads to a diagnosis in 25%\u201330% of patients. Our data show that after GJB2, the most commonly mutated genes in a Western-European population are TMC1, MYO15A, and MYO7A (3.1%). CNV analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in OTOA and STRC. One of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants. A collaborative database collecting all identified variants from multiple centers could be a valuable resource for hearing loss diagnostics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hereditary hearing loss", "mutation classification system", "targeted resequencing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978112653", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55354846500": {"Name": "Sommen M.", "AuthorID": "55354846500", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp"}, "15926036400": {"Name": "Schrauwen I.", "AuthorID": "15926036400", "AffiliationID": "60009543", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenomics Division, Translational Genomics Research Institute"}, "26322164000": {"Name": "Vandeweyer G.", "AuthorID": "26322164000", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp"}, "56327300400": {"Name": "Boeckx N.", "AuthorID": "56327300400", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp"}, "7005986956": {"Name": "van den Ende J.", "AuthorID": "7005986956", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Antwerp University Hospital"}, "56075837200": {"Name": "Wuyts W.", "AuthorID": "56075837200", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Antwerp University Hospital"}, "7004988990": {"Name": "Mortier G.", "AuthorID": "7004988990", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Antwerp University Hospital"}, "34573802800": {"Name": "Van Camp G.", "AuthorID": "34573802800", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp"}, "57200745524": {"Name": "Corneveaux J.J.", "AuthorID": "57200745524", "AffiliationID": "60009543", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenomics Division, Translational Genomics Research Institute"}, "57194555559": {"Name": "Huentelman M.J.", "AuthorID": "57194555559", "AffiliationID": "60009543", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenomics Division, Translational Genomics Research Institute"}, "6701308057": {"Name": "Boudewyns A.", "AuthorID": "6701308057", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "6603740893": {"Name": "De Leenheer E.", "AuthorID": "6603740893", "AffiliationID": "60033316, 60107744", "AffiliationName": "Center of Medical Genetics, Ghent University"}, "7005391887": {"Name": "Janssens S.", "AuthorID": "7005391887", "AffiliationID": "60033316, 60107744", "AffiliationName": "Center of Medical Genetics, Ghent University"}, "57205637730": {"Name": "Claes K.", "AuthorID": "57205637730", "AffiliationID": "60033316, 60107744", "AffiliationName": "Center of Medical Genetics, Ghent University"}, "26644783600": {"Name": "Coucke P.", "AuthorID": "26644783600", "AffiliationID": "60033316, 60107744", "AffiliationName": "Center of Medical Genetics, Ghent University"}, "6701434740": {"Name": "Verstreken M.", "AuthorID": "6701434740", "AffiliationID": "60072273", "AffiliationName": "University Department Otolaryngology, St. Augustinus Hospital"}, "12752910700": {"Name": "Strenzke N.", "AuthorID": "12752910700", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Inner Ear Lab, Department of Otolaryngology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57189222875": {"Name": "Pred\u00f6hl F.", "AuthorID": "57189222875", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Inner Ear Lab, Department of Otolaryngology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "7007050113": {"Name": "Moser T.", "AuthorID": "7007050113", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Auditory Neuroscience and InnerEarLab, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "7003541560": {"Name": "Bitner-Glindzicz M.", "AuthorID": "7003541560", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
