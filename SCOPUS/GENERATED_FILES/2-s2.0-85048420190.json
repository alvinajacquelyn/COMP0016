All rights reserved.Rapid technological innovations, including the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), introduce a range of uncertainties, opportunities, and risks. While it is not possible to accurately foresee IoT\u2019s myriad ramifications, futures and foresight methodologies allow for the exploration of plausible futures and their desirability. Drawing on the futures and foresight literature, the current paper employs a standardised expert elicitation approach to study emerging risk patterns in descriptions of IoT risk scenarios. We surveyed 19 IoT experts between January and February 2018 using an online questionnaire. The submitted scenarios provided expert\u2019s perception of evolving IoT risk trajectories and were evaluated using thematic analysis, a method used to identify and report patterns within data. Four common themes were extracted: physical safety; crime and exploitation; loss of control; and social norms and structures. These themes provide suitable analytical tools to contextualise emerging risks and help detecting gaps about security and privacy challenges in the IoT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Foresight", "Futures", "Internet of things", "Privacy", "Risks", "Security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Expert elicitation", "Foresight", "Futures", "Internet of thing (IOT)", "Online questionnaire", "Security", "Security and privacy", "Technological innovation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048420190", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190816291": {"Name": "Tanczer L.M.", "AuthorID": "57190816291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "57202449352": {"Name": "Steenmans I.", "AuthorID": "57202449352", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "57202457853": {"Name": "Elsden M.", "AuthorID": "57202457853", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "36853249900": {"Name": "Blackstock J.", "AuthorID": "36853249900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "55859713100": {"Name": "Carr M.", "AuthorID": "55859713100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}}}
