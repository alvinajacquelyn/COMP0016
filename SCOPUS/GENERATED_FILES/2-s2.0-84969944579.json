In this study, students were randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 53) receiving five weekly CT-courses of 30 min duration during a 6-week gross anatomy course. Students in the control group (n = 329) received no additional teaching. Total teaching time did not differ among groups. All students were asked to participate in a pre- and post-course self-assessment (comparative self-assessment; CSA) of learning objectives related to anatomical spatial relationships and a post-course formative assessment on radiologic anatomy. Items of both assessments were matched. Moreover, students of the intervention group were asked to evaluate the CT-courses. Most participants of the intervention group classified the CT-courses as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d. Nevertheless, results of the CSA and formative assessment did not differ among study and control groups. These findings indicate that the teaching intervention (CT-courses) did not have an impact on recognition of anatomical structures in radiological images beyond the knowledge acquired in the anatomical dissection course. As a consequence, interventions integrating radiology imaging into dissection courses should be based on psychological considerations of how to best foster student learning. Learning outcome has to be monitored, as results of evaluation surveys can be misleading. Further research on curricular concepts is needed considering both short- and long-term effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anatomy teaching", "Computed tomography", "Medical education"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anatomy", "Autopsy", "Cadaver", "Computer-Assisted Instruction", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Educational Measurement", "Female", "Germany", "Humans", "Male", "Teaching", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "User-Computer Interface", "Whole Body Imaging", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969944579", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57189384607": {"Name": "Buenting M.", "AuthorID": "57189384607", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "57189383938": {"Name": "Mueller T.", "AuthorID": "57189383938", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "55762981800": {"Name": "Gehl A.", "AuthorID": "55762981800", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "57200811182": {"Name": "Anders S.", "AuthorID": "57200811182", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "23135592200": {"Name": "Raupach T.", "AuthorID": "23135592200", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology and Pulmonology, University Hospital Goettingen"}, "6603811547": {"Name": "Luers G.", "AuthorID": "6603811547", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Experimental Morphology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "6602452031": {"Name": "Wehrenberg U.", "AuthorID": "6602452031", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroanatomy, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
