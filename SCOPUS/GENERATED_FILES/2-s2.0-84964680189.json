It argued that the subtle subclinical disturbances in mental processes described as BSs were the most direct self-experienced expression of the underlying neurobiological aberrations of the disease. Other characteristic symptoms of psychosis (e.g., delusions and hallucinations) were conceptualized as secondary phenomena, resulting from dysfunctional beliefs and suboptimal coping styles with emerging BSs and/or concomitant stressors. While BSs can occur in many mental disorders, in particular affective disorders, a subset of perceptive and cognitive BSs appear to be specific to psychosis and are currently employed in two alternative risk criteria. However, despite their clinical recognition in the early detection of psychosis, neurobiological research on the aetiopathology of psychosis with neuroimaging methods has only just begun to consider the neural correlate of BSs. This perspective paper reviews the emerging evidence of an association between BSs and aberrant brain activation, connectivity patterns, and metabolism, and outlines promising routes for the use of BSs in aetiopathological research on psychosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aetiopathology", "Basic symptoms", "Clinical high risk", "Neurobiology", "Psychosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964680189", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6602139887": {"Name": "Schultze-Lutter F.", "AuthorID": "6602139887", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Child, Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "37120861700": {"Name": "Michel C.", "AuthorID": "37120861700", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Child, Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "49362234100": {"Name": "Schmidt S.J.", "AuthorID": "49362234100", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Child, Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "23012046300": {"Name": "Kindler J.", "AuthorID": "23012046300", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Child, Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "8724552100": {"Name": "Debban\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "8724552100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "14036503400": {"Name": "Theodoridou A.", "AuthorID": "14036503400", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University Hospital of Psychiatry"}, "7401448373": {"Name": "Wood S.J.", "AuthorID": "7401448373", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "6602259569": {"Name": "Raballo A.", "AuthorID": "6602259569", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research (NORMENT), Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "6701546897": {"Name": "Ruhrmann S.", "AuthorID": "6701546897", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Cologne"}, "8081711400": {"Name": "Uhlhaas P.J.", "AuthorID": "8081711400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow"}}}
