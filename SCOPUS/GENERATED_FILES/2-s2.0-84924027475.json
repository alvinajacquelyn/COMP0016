This paper presents an approach to designing for, as opposed to with, empathy using the example of two design interventions to create embodied rituals reflecting prayers and worries of individuals within a church community. The aim of these interventions is to facilitate conversation and support within the community, thus generating empathy between community members, and inciting prosocial behaviour through embodied cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Design", "Digital empathy", "Embodied actions", "Empathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design objectives", "Digital empathy", "Embodied actions", "Embodied cognition", "Empathy", "Interactive system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924027475", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56278717700": {"Name": "Huck J.", "AuthorID": "56278717700", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Imagination Lancaster, LICA Building, Lancaster University"}, "6701726566": {"Name": "Coulton P.", "AuthorID": "6701726566", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Imagination Lancaster, LICA Building, Lancaster University"}, "57189437410": {"Name": "Gullick D.", "AuthorID": "57189437410", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Imagination Lancaster, LICA Building, Lancaster University"}, "55598199600": {"Name": "Powell P.", "AuthorID": "55598199600", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "InstEAD, Department of Economics, University of Sheffield"}, "56925838100": {"Name": "Roberts J.", "AuthorID": "56925838100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "InstEAD, Department of Economics, University of Sheffield"}, "15055935100": {"Name": "Hudson-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "15055935100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CASA, UCL"}, "53263340900": {"Name": "De-Jode M.", "AuthorID": "53263340900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CASA, UCL"}, "55617109300": {"Name": "Mavros P.", "AuthorID": "55617109300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CASA, UCL"}}}
