This enables the formation of wideband pulses, which is a desirable feature in the context of diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound applications. However, coupling of the ultrasonic energy from a chain of spheres into biological tissue is a big challenge. In order to improve the energy transfer efficiency into biological materials, a matching layer is required. A prototype device is designed to address this by using six aluminum spheres and a vitreous carbon matching layer. The matching layer and the precompression force are selected specifically to maximize the acoustic pressure in water and its bandwidth. The designed device generates a train of wideband ultrasonic pulses from a narrow-band input with a center frequency of 73 kHz. An analytical model is created to simulate the behavior of a matching layer as a flexible thin plate clamped from the edges. This model is then verified using free-field hydrophone measurements in water, which successfully predict the increased bandwidth by generation of harmonics. The shapes of the measured and predicted waveforms are compared by calculating the normalized cross-correlation, which shows 83% similarity between both. Since the generation of harmonics is of interest in this study, the total harmonic distortion (THD) and the -6-dB bandwidth of the signals are used to analyze signal fidelity between the hydrophone measurements and the model predictions. The acoustic signals in water have a root-mean-square THD of 73%, and the model predicts a root-mean-square THD of 78%. The -6-dB bandwidths of individual pulses measured by a hydrophone and predicted with the model are 280 and 252 kHz, respectively. At these high ultrasonic frequencies, it is an experimental demonstration of resonant chains operating in water with a matching layer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Energy transfer efficiency", "Experimental demonstrations", "Finite matching layers", "Generation of harmonics", "Normalized cross correlation", "Therapeutic ultrasound", "Total harmonic distortion (THD)", "Ultrasonic frequency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036631391", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"25627901700": {"Name": "Harput S.", "AuthorID": "25627901700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasonics and Instrumentation Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "15136075700": {"Name": "McLaughlan J.", "AuthorID": "15136075700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Imaging, University of Leeds"}, "23102747000": {"Name": "Cowell D.", "AuthorID": "23102747000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasonics and Instrumentation Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "23102587700": {"Name": "Freear S.", "AuthorID": "23102587700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasonics and Instrumentation Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "6505814954": {"Name": "Gelat P.", "AuthorID": "6505814954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603625764": {"Name": "Saffari N.", "AuthorID": "6603625764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56982480200": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "56982480200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "56043323600": {"Name": "Akanji O.", "AuthorID": "56043323600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "56413563600": {"Name": "Thomas P.", "AuthorID": "56413563600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "7102874618": {"Name": "Hutchins D.", "AuthorID": "7102874618", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}}}
