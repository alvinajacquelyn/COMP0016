Here we show that a Bayesian inference scheme, which tracks the power of individuals, better captures behavioral and neural data compared with a reinforcement learning model inspired by rating systems used in games such as chess. We provide evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) selectively mediates the updating of knowledge about one's own hierarchy, as opposed to that of another individual, a process that underpinned successful performance and involved functional interactions with the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, we observed domain-general coding of rank in the amygdala and hippocampus, even when the task did not require it. Our findings reveal the computations underlying a core aspect of social cognition and provide new evidence that self-relevant information may indeed be afforded a unique representational status in the brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian", "hippocampus", "learning", "memory", "prefrontal cortex", "reinforcement learning", "social hierarchy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amygdala", "Bayes Theorem", "Brain", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Hierarchy, Social", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Models, Psychological", "Neural Pathways", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reinforcement (Psychology)", "Self Concept", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003666696", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"8650774800": {"Name": "Kumaran D.", "AuthorID": "8650774800", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57190662759": {"Name": "Banino A.", "AuthorID": "57190662759", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "Google DeepMind"}, "53063236700": {"Name": "Blundell C.", "AuthorID": "53063236700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "Google DeepMind"}, "15839738700": {"Name": "Hassabis D.", "AuthorID": "15839738700", "AffiliationID": "60084280", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit"}}}
