Dermatophytes are keratinophilic and are usually confined to the stratum corneum, hair and nails. Susceptibility to dermatophyte infections is incompletely understood, but inherited mutations in key signalling pathways of the innate immune system have been identified. We report the first case of an invasive dermatophyte infection associated with abrupt onset of a prurigo-induced pseudoperforation and a loss-of-function mutation in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antifungal Agents", "Biopsy", "Dermatomycoses", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Glucocorticoids", "Groin", "Humans", "Invasive Fungal Infections", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prurigo", "Skin", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Th17 Cells", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Trichophyton"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043239686", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"56599711500": {"Name": "Simpson J.K.", "AuthorID": "56599711500", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "6602926285": {"Name": "Fearfield L.", "AuthorID": "6602926285", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "57201058577": {"Name": "Fr\u00f6bel P.", "AuthorID": "57201058577", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg and University of Freiburg"}, "26643476400": {"Name": "Grimbacher B.", "AuthorID": "26643476400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "6505849956": {"Name": "Fliegauf M.", "AuthorID": "6505849956", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg and University of Freiburg"}, "7003499455": {"Name": "Seneviratne S.L.", "AuthorID": "7003499455", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "57213673329": {"Name": "Lowe D.M.", "AuthorID": "57213673329", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7405388484": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "7405388484", "AffiliationID": "60023116, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London Hospital"}}}
