Various genetic mutations are associated with AML. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family, plays an important role in stem cell survival, and the development of dendritic and natural killer cells. FLT3/TKD mutations are generally missense mutations or in-frame alterations of residues D835 and I836 within the activation loop of the FLT3 protein. D835 mutations have been reported to occur in \u2248 7% of AML patients. Mutations have also been reported in exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in \u22489% of AML patients. Mutations in FLT3/TKD and IDH1 genes were studied in AML patients from Pakistan and correlated with the laboratory findings. FLT3/TKD mutations were found in 7%, while IDH1 mutations were found in 10% Pakistani AML patients. Neither of these mutations was significantly correlated with age and sex, although the incidence of these mutations was higher in female patients. These mutations were found to be positively associated with each other. IDH1 mutations were positively associated with FAB type M1 and negatively associated with FAB type M2. In conclusion, the overall incidence of all these mutations in Pakistani patients was within the globally reported ranges. J. Cell.
