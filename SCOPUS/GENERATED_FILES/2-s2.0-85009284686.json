The utilisation of EGR and intake air boost with H2-diesel fuel co-combustion allows simultaneous NOx and particulate emissions reduction at conditions closer to on-road driving conditions. The results showed that while H2 can be favourable in reducing CO2 and particulate emissions, it causes an increase in NOx emissions when the intake energy contribution from H2 is increased. A reduction in the number of fine and ultrafine particles (diameter 0.05\u20130.2 \u03bcm) was observed when H2 was added to the engine, especially at the low and intermediate intake air boost levels. At high EGR levels (equivalent to 2% intake O2 concentration reduction) significant reductions in exhaust particulate mass of up to 75% were observed at 15% energy from H2. An attempt was made to identify the optimum H2 operating window at the different engine loads, intake air boost and EGR levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-combustion", "Diesel engine", "EGR", "Exhaust emissions", "Hydrogen", "Intake air boost"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cocombustion", "Combustion characteristics", "Concentration reduction", "Energy contribution", "Exhaust emission", "Exhaust particulates", "Fine and ultrafine particles", "Intake air"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009284686", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55745306300": {"Name": "Talibi M.", "AuthorID": "55745306300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55174359600": {"Name": "Hellier P.", "AuthorID": "55174359600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003607190": {"Name": "Ladommatos N.", "AuthorID": "7003607190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
