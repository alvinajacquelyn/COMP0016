As entrepreneurial firms can grow only slowly and rely heavily on retained earnings to expand the size of their business, we show that, by reducing entrepreneurial firm size and earnings, negative shocks have a very persistent effect on real activity. In determining the speed of recovery from an adverse economic shock, the most important factor is the extent to which the shock erodes entrepreneurial wealth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borrowing constraints", "Credit allocation", "Credit crunches", "D58", "E21", "E22", "E32", "E44", "E62", "Entrepreneurship", "Wealth inequality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923025567", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6603968952": {"Name": "Bassetto M.", "AuthorID": "6603968952", "AffiliationID": "60012327", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "24764534000": {"Name": "De Nardi M.", "AuthorID": "24764534000", "AffiliationID": "60020337", "AffiliationName": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}, "7003957143": {"Name": "Cagetti M.", "AuthorID": "7003957143", "AffiliationID": "60023612", "AffiliationName": "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System"}}}
