We define the condition of urbanism through four traits, each of which we associate with measurable variables. We explore changes in these across the study area in 100-year time bins over 6000 years. We also consider urbanism as a process that includes five kinds of relations. We consider these through six chronological stanzas visible in our metric data. While there is evidence of changes towards urbanism, we argue that urbanism as a condition is not evident in our data. We propose that urbanism involves a suite of causes and trajectories with multiple potential outcomes, not all of which achieve the threshold of cities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hunter-gatherer-fishers", "Settlement pattern analysis", "Tsimshian archaeology", "Urbanism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055109124", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"12039529000": {"Name": "Martindale A.", "AuthorID": "12039529000", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of British Columbia"}, "26434313700": {"Name": "Letham B.", "AuthorID": "26434313700", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of British Columbia"}, "57197755809": {"Name": "Brown T.J.", "AuthorID": "57197755809", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of British Columbia"}, "57211003153": {"Name": "Duelks J.", "AuthorID": "57211003153", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of British Columbia"}, "26032440900": {"Name": "Supernant K.", "AuthorID": "26032440900", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Alberta"}, "24722595900": {"Name": "Edinborough K.", "AuthorID": "24722595900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7004197469": {"Name": "Ames K.M.", "AuthorID": "7004197469", "AffiliationID": "60023908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Portland State University"}}}
