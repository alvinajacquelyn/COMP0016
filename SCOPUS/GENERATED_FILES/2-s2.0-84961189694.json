FoxP3 is believed to perform a regulatory role in all the vertebrate species in which it has been detected. The prevailing view is that FoxP3 is absent in birds and that avian Tregs rely on alternative developmental and suppressive pathways. Prompted by the automated annotation of foxp3 in the ground tit (Parus humilis) genome, we have questioned this assumption. Our analysis of all available avian genomes has revealed that the foxp3 locus is missing, incomplete or of poor quality in the relevant genomic assemblies for nearly all avian species. Nevertheless, in two species, the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the saker falcon (F. cherrug), there is compelling evidence for the existence of exons showing synteny with foxp3 in the ground tit. A broader phylogenomic analysis has shown that FoxP3 sequences from these three species are similar to crocodilian sequences, the closest living relatives of birds. In both birds and crocodilians, we have also identified a highly proline-enriched region at the N terminus of FoxP3, a region previously identified only in mammals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alligators and Crocodiles", "Animals", "Birds", "Evolution, Molecular", "Falconiformes", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genome", "Genomics", "Immune System", "Phylogeny", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Species Specificity", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961189694", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57183926800": {"Name": "Denyer M.P.", "AuthorID": "57183926800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology and Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36661440100": {"Name": "Pinheiro D.Y.", "AuthorID": "36661440100", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7006432340": {"Name": "Garden O.A.", "AuthorID": "7006432340", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "36118495000": {"Name": "Shepherd A.J.", "AuthorID": "36118495000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology and Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
