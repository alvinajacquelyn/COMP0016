Design: Multivariate analyses using nationally representative data in 2010\u20132011 on self-assessed general health, activity-limiting illness, doctor-diagnosed diabetes, doctor-diagnosed high blood pressure, doctor-diagnosed asthma and body mass index from 21,651 White British, 997 Pakistanis, 695 Bangladeshis, 1,126 Indians, 573 Black Caribbeans and 873 Black Africans, adjusted for age, gender, health-related behaviors and socio-economic status. Results: While ethnicity is of great importance in patterning health differences, we find that ethnic differences in activity-limiting illness, diabetes, asthma and body mass index vary across generations. Health-related behaviors and socio-economic status are shown to partly explain ethnic and generational differences in some health outcomes. Conclusions: This study enables a better understanding of more nuanced patterns of ethnic and generational differences in health, highlighting the need to understand ethnicity as a fluid and changing characteristic, and the importance of socio-economic status and health-related behaviors in shaping ethnic differences in certain health outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethnic minorities", "health", "health-related behavior", "immigrants", "minority generation", "socio-economic status"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046011655", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57201742291": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57201742291", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge, Free School Lane"}, "57201744182": {"Name": "Mak H.W.", "AuthorID": "57201744182", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge, Free School Lane"}}}
