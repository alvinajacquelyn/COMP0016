Yet, currently there is no comprehensive understanding of what constitute 3D image qualities for a digital artefact, from the point of view of a heritage professional. An online survey addressed to the international heritage community gauged information about current adoption of 3D imaging technologies, priorities for 3D image quality and visions of future use. Despite a number of barriers, there is a high interest in 3D imaging technologies across heritage institutions and the museum sector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D imaging", "heritage professional users", "museums", "qualitative research", "survey", "user requirements"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D image", "3D imaging", "Cultural heritages", "Digital documentation", "Online surveys", "Professional users", "Qualitative research", "User requirements"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965146918", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"]], "AuthorData": {"38861761200": {"Name": "Hess M.", "AuthorID": "38861761200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (UCL CEGE), University College London"}}}
