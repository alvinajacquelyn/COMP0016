This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licenseZebrafish have become an established in vivo vertebrate model to study cardiovascular development and disease. However, most published studies of the zebrafish vascular architecture rely on subjective visual assessment, rather than objective quantification. In this paper, we used state-of-the-art light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize the vasculature in transgenic fluorescent reporter zebrafish. Analysis of image quality, vascular enhancement methods, and segmentation approaches were performed in the framework of the open-source software Fiji to allow dissemination and reproducibility. Here, we build on a previously developed image processing pipeline; evaluate its applicability to a wider range of data; apply and evaluate an alternative vascular enhancement method; and, finally, suggest a work-flow for successful segmentation of the embryonic zebrafish vasculature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D", "Analysis", "Development", "In vivo", "Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM)", "Segmentation", "Vasculature", "Zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063211317", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57159287500": {"Name": "Kugler E.", "AuthorID": "57159287500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Bateson Centre, Firth Court, University of Sheffield"}, "57197626659": {"Name": "Plant K.", "AuthorID": "57197626659", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Bateson Centre, Firth Court, University of Sheffield"}, "6602881822": {"Name": "Chico T.", "AuthorID": "6602881822", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Bateson Centre, Firth Court, University of Sheffield"}, "7103166287": {"Name": "Armitage P.", "AuthorID": "7103166287", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sheffield"}}}
