However, little previous research has focused on low-income populations. Due to economic constraints, low-income populations have relatively fewer travel options, and are more likely to experience transport poverty, which may prevent them from participating in social activities, reducing their life chances and wellbeing. Studying factors contributing to lower levels of travel satisfaction of low-income populations is important to improve their life satisfaction of and overall societal wellbeing. Drawing on recent survey data from Xi'an, China, this study explored factors associated with commuting satisfaction amongst the lower income working population. This study found that the lower income respondents consistently reported lower levels of commuting satisfaction. Such factors as commuting characteristics and the attitudes towards travel significantly influence commuting satisfaction. Also, a mismatch between commuting mode choice and travel attitudes contributes to a lower level of commuting satisfaction. Bicycling commuters have the highest level of commuting satisfaction in the higher income group, while the differences in commuting satisfaction between modes users are not significant in the lower income group. Travel attitudes towards specific travel modes are significantly associated with commuting satisfaction in the lower income group but not in the higher income group. After accounting for attitudes and commuting mode choice, the independent effects of the built environment on commuting satisfaction are not significant.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060767863", "SubjectAreas": [["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"56754674400": {"Name": "Ye R.", "AuthorID": "56754674400", "AffiliationID": "60118504, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning, The University of Melbourne"}, "56242241100": {"Name": "Titheridge H.", "AuthorID": "56242241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
