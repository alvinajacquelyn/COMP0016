There is a need for a reference tool compiling current data to aid professionals in treatment decisions. Objectives: To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment of people with MS. Methods: This guideline has been developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and following the updated EAN recommendations. Clinical questions were formulated in Patients\u2013Intervention\u2013Comparator\u2013Outcome (PICO) format and outcomes were prioritized. The quality of evidence was rated into four categories according to the risk of bias. The recommendations with assigned strength (strong and weak) were formulated based on the quality of evidence and the risk-benefit balance. Consensus between the panelists was reached by use of the modified nominal group technique. Results: A total of 10 questions were agreed, encompassing treatment efficacy, response criteria, strategies to address suboptimal response and safety concerns and treatment strategies in MS and pregnancy. The guideline takes into account all disease-modifying drugs approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) at the time of publication. A total of 21 recommendations were agreed by the guideline working group after three rounds of consensus. Conclusion: The present guideline will enable homogeneity of treatment decisions across Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disease-modifying therapies", "GRADE methodology", "guideline", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041492438", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7007177960": {"Name": "Montalban X.", "AuthorID": "7007177960", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Vall d\u2019Hebron University Hospital"}, "24376504700": {"Name": "Otero-Romero S.", "AuthorID": "24376504700", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology Department, Vall d\u2019Hebron University Hospital"}, "55801391500": {"Name": "Gold R.", "AuthorID": "55801391500", "AffiliationID": "60108391, 60005322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ruhr University, St. Josef-Hospital"}, "7404597283": {"Name": "Thompson A.J.", "AuthorID": "7404597283", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair & Rehabilitation and Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7103061535": {"Name": "Amato M.P.", "AuthorID": "7103061535", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Psychology, Drugs and Child Health Area (NEUROFARBA), Section Neurosciences, University of Florence"}, "55408805900": {"Name": "Chandraratna D.", "AuthorID": "55408805900", "AffiliationID": "113154961", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis International Federation"}, "7004504062": {"Name": "Clanet M.", "AuthorID": "7004504062", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Toulouse University Hospital"}, "7201788288": {"Name": "Comi G.", "AuthorID": "7201788288", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Department, Institute of Experimental Neurology (INSPE), Scientific Institute Hospital San Raffaele, Universita\u2019 Vita-Salute San Raffaele"}, "6602736963": {"Name": "Derfuss T.", "AuthorID": "6602736963", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel"}, "7102945505": {"Name": "Fazekas F.", "AuthorID": "7102945505", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "35372254600": {"Name": "Hartung H.P.", "AuthorID": "35372254600", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "57201596736": {"Name": "Havrdova E.", "AuthorID": "57201596736", "AffiliationID": "60016605, 60039507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Charles University"}, "7005721046": {"Name": "Hemmer B.", "AuthorID": "7005721046", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen and Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy)"}, "7004559324": {"Name": "Kappos L.", "AuthorID": "7004559324", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Basel"}, "7005706082": {"Name": "Liblau R.", "AuthorID": "7005706082", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60122688, 60008134, 60102124, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR U1043 -
