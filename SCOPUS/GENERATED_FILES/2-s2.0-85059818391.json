The aim of this review was to identify patient-related factors associated with the screening test's use. We searched PubMed for studies that examined the association between FS screening use and one or more factors. To determine the eligibility of studies, we first reviewed titles, then abstracts, and finally the full paper. We started with a narrow search, which we expanded successively (by adding \u2018OR\u2019 terms) until the number of new publications eligible after abstract review was <1% of the total number of publications. We then abstracted factors from eligible papers and reported the number of times each was found to be positively or negatively associated with FS screening use. We identified 42 papers, most of which reported studies conducted in the United States of America (n = 21, 50%) and the United Kingdom (n = 13, 31%). Across studies, a wide range of factors were examined (n = 123), almost half of which were found to be associated with FS screening use at least once (n = 60). Sociodemographic and health and lifestyle factors that were frequently positively associated with FS screening use included: male gender, higher socioeconomic status and a family history of CRC. Frequently positively associated psychosocial factors included low perceived barriers and high perceived benefits. Findings suggest that future research should focus on developing a theoretical framework of cancer screening behaviour to allow a greater level of consistency and specificity in measuring key constructs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barriers", "Bowel scope screening", "Facilitators", "Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening", "Uptake"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Factors", "Sigmoidoscopy", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059818391", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56513969200": {"Name": "Kerrison R.S.", "AuthorID": "56513969200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "44361787800": {"Name": "McGregor L.M.", "AuthorID": "44361787800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55804223900": {"Name": "Green T.", "AuthorID": "55804223900", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469", "AffiliationName": "Hull York Medical School, University of Hull"}, "57207811596": {"Name": "Macleod U.", "AuthorID": "57207811596", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469", "AffiliationName": "Hull York Medical School, University of Hull"}, "57203819136": {"Name": "Gibbins M.", "AuthorID": "57203819136", "AffiliationID": "101538063", "AffiliationName": "Patient representative"}, "56645615100": {"Name": "Hughes M.", "AuthorID": "56645615100", "AffiliationID": "60025144, 60005954", "AffiliationName": "Hull and East Yorkshire Bowel Cancer Screening Centre, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital"}, "47962506400": {"Name": "Rees C.J.", "AuthorID": "47962506400", "AffiliationID": "60012973, 60176727", "AffiliationName": "South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust, South Tyneside District Hospital"}, "35942266800": {"Name": "Duffy S.", "AuthorID": "35942266800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University London"}}}
