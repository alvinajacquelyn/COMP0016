We describe an algorithm for the offline correction of eye-tracking data. The algorithm conducts a linear transformation of the coordinates of fixations that minimizes the distance between each fixation and its closest stimulus. A simple implementation in MATLAB is also presented. We explore the performance of the correction algorithm under several conditions using simulated and real data, and show that it is particularly likely to improve data quality when many fixations are included in the fitting process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drift correction", "Eye-tracking", "Recalibration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Calibration", "Eye Movements", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Psychomotor Performance", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947026009", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"6602776139": {"Name": "Vadillo M.", "AuthorID": "6602776139", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55555489800": {"Name": "Street C.", "AuthorID": "55555489800", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "14424213800": {"Name": "Beesley T.", "AuthorID": "14424213800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "University of New South Wales"}}}
