Consequently, serum UA has gained much attention as a possible biomarker of MS. We aim to investigate differences in serum UA levels between MS subjects and controls and evaluate possible relationships of UA with MS clinical features. Methods: We recruited relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS subjects and healthy controls and measured their serum UA levels. We excluded subjects presenting concomitant conditions affecting UA levels. Results: MS subjects (n=362) and controls (n=181) were recruited by propensity score matching (PSM). Statistical analyses were corrected for age, gender, and renal function. MS subjects presented significantly lower serum UA levels than controls (analysis of variance, p=0.014, adjusted r2=0.3036). Linear regression analysis showed a relationship between UA levels and disease duration (p<0.001, adjusted r2=0.3158, coefficient -0.00039), time from diagnosis (p<0.001, adjusted r2=0.3100, coefficient -0.0012), and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (p<0.001, adjusted r2=0.3230, coefficient -0.1). Conclusions: Our findings support the importance of serum UA as a biomarker of MS disability and progression. Further studies with longitudinal design should be specifically designed to evaluate the importance of UA in the different stages of MS and in relation to distinct therapeutic strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)", "multiple sclerosis", "oxidant", "scavenger", "urate", "uric acid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Disabled Persons", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Uric Acid", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928037434", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57206717484": {"Name": "Lanzillo R.", "AuthorID": "57206717484", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57216680924": {"Name": "Russo C.", "AuthorID": "57216680924", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "55173366900": {"Name": "Carotenuto A.", "AuthorID": "55173366900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "25927380400": {"Name": "Massarelli M.", "AuthorID": "25927380400", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57201598911": {"Name": "Vacca G.", "AuthorID": "57201598911", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "56597996900": {"Name": "Vacchiano V.", "AuthorID": "56597996900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "6603751678": {"Name": "Morra V.B.", "AuthorID": "6603751678", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57215205417": {"Name": "Palladino R.", "AuthorID": "57215205417", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College"}, "35951574300": {"Name": "Nardone A.", "AuthorID": "35951574300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Federico II University of Naples"}, "7004289116": {"Name": "Triassi M.", "AuthorID": "7004289116", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Federico II University of Naples"}}}
