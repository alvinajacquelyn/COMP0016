However, few studies report in vivo investigations of the biotransformation of silver nanoparticles within the regenerating tissue and its impact on bone formation. We present a longitudinal investigation of the osseointegration of silver nanoparticle-coated additive manufactured titanium implants in rat tibial defects. Correlative imaging at different time points using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), histomorphometry, and 3D X-ray microcomputed tomography provided quantitative insight from the nano- to macroscales. The quality and quantity of newly formed bone is comparable between the uncoated and silver coated implants. The newly formed bone demonstrates a trabecular morphology with bone being located at the implant surface, and at a distance, at two weeks. Nanoscale elemental mapping of the bone-implant interface showed that silver was present primarily in the osseous tissue and colocalized with sulfur. TEM revealed silver sulfide nanoparticles in the newly regenerated bone, presenting strong evidence that the previously in vitro observed biotransformation of silver to silver sulfide occurs in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atomic layer deposition", "biotransformation", "bone formation", "osseointegration", "silver nanoparticle coatings"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antimicrobial silvers", "biotransformation", "Bone formation", "Bone-implant interfaces", "Osseointegration", "Prosthetic joints", "Silver nanoparticles", "Titanium implants", "Animals", "Biotransformation", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Osseointegration", "Rats", "Silver", "Surface Properties", "Titanium", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021683968", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57189219743": {"Name": "Geng H.", "AuthorID": "57189219743", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "15725995900": {"Name": "Poologasundarampillai G.", "AuthorID": "15725995900", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "56214663500": {"Name": "Moore K.L.", "AuthorID": "56214663500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "57191479618": {"Name": "O'Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57191479618", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "6602075256": {"Name": "Cartmell S.", "AuthorID": "6602075256", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "55344450000": {"Name": "Gilchrist J.B.", "AuthorID": "55344450000", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "57189218580": {"Name": "Todd N.", "AuthorID": "57189218580", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Biosciences (CMB), School of Biomedical Sciences, Ulster University"}, "57189215968": {"Name": "Devlin-Mullin A.", "AuthorID": "57189215968", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Biosciences (CMB), School of Biomedical Sciences, Ulster University"}, "57214452086": {"Name": "Mitchell C.A.", "AuthorID": "57214452086", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Biosciences (CMB), School of Biomedical Sciences, Ulster University"}, "57188841483": {"Name": "Golrokhi Z.", "AuthorID": "57188841483", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials and Structures, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "57206203417": {"Name": "Jones E.", "AuthorID": "57206203417", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials and Structures, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "7202993130": {"Name": "Potter R.J.", "AuthorID": "7202993130", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials and Structures, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "8589381600": {"Name": "Sutcliffe C.", "AuthorID": "8589381600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials and Structures, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "7005715890": {"Name": "Hukins D.W.L.", "AuthorID": "7005715890", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Birmingham"}}}
