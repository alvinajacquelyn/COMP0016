Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article discusses how the introduction of technology has led to a fundamental shift in the relationship between education and time. As a means of analysing the extent of such changes on pupils from different backgrounds, I use Bernstein\u2019s \u2018conditions for democracy\u2019 as a framework for evaluating the impact new understandings of time in education are having on disadvantaged social groups in England. I conclude that Bernstein\u2019s framework presents a useful way of illuminating the complex interplay of personal agency and the external environment. Consequently, here we see that new definitions of time in education, specifically with regard to synchronous versus asynchronous learning, have resulted in new inequalities for those in deprived areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["democracy", "inclusion", "learning", "social class", "technology", "Time"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008871172", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57192904061": {"Name": "Leaton Gray S.", "AuthorID": "57192904061", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
