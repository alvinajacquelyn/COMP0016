All rights reserved.Purpose of review Antimicrobial-resistant respiratory tract infections (AMR-RTIs) are increasing, presenting important management challenges worldwide. Current management of AMR-RTI patients focuses on pathogen-directed antimicrobial treatment. Overt lung inflammation, parenchymal damage, and ineffective immune activation perpetrate increased patient morbidity and mortality. Immunomodulatory and tissue-regenerative host-directed therapies (HDT) may improve treatment outcomes. HDTs under investigation for improving AMR-RTI treatment outcomes are reviewed. Recent findings Various HDTs are being developed or evaluated for adjunctive AMR-RTI treatment. \u03b1-1 antitrypsin was shown to reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa burden in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Cellular therapy by reinfusing autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs into MDR/XDR-TB patients shows promise, whereas adjunctive T cell-based therapies are considered. Cytotoxic therapy using etoposide, a topoisomerase II-inhibiting anticancer drug extends survival of patients with severe influenza H1N1 infection-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Two other novel HDT candidates, DAS181 and resveratrol show antiinfluenza effects. Novel kinase inhibitors SB203580 (MAPK-2 antagonist) and LY294002 (phosphoinositide-3 kinases antagonist) exhibit promising anti-MERS-CoV activity. Palivizumab, an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, effectively prevents RSV infection in high-risk paediatric populations. T-cell therapy is currently considered for adjunctive HDT of azole-resistant pulmonary aspergillosis. Summary Novel HDTs may revolutionize future treatment regimens for AMR-RTIs. Well designed multisite clinical trials are now necessary to accelerate progress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antimicrobial resistance", "host-directed therapies", "immune response", "inflammation", "respiratory infections"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Infective Agents", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Humans", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961231082", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (CAST), Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "57216111663": {"Name": "Rao M.", "AuthorID": "57216111663", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Therapeutic Immunology (TIM), Department of Laboratory Medicine (LABMED), Karolinska Institutet, South Campus, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
