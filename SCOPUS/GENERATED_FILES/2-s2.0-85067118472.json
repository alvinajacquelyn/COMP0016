This review explores the existing scientific evidence on clinical, functional and radiological outcomes in total hip arthroplasty performed using the direct superior approach. The direct superior approach reduces iatrogenic periarticular soft tissue injury compared to the direct anterior approach for total hip arthroplasty. The learning curve for the direct superior approach is 40 operative cases with operative times comparable to those of conventional approaches for total hip arthroplasty after surgical proficiency has been achieved. The direct superior approach provides improvements in pain and short-term functional outcomes after total hip arthroplasty as assessed using the Harris Hip Score. The minimally invasive posterior approach provides comparable pain scores and improved University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale functional scores to the direct superior approach at 1-year follow up. Existing studies using plain radiographs have shown that the direct superior approach enables accurate femoral and acetabular implant positioning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Humans", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Pain, Postoperative", "Postoperative Complications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067118472", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "57209275150": {"Name": "Chandramohan R.", "AuthorID": "57209275150", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}}}
