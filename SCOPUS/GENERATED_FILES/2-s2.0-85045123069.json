Here, we present a multi-proxy record of marine sediments from ODP Site 1087. We reconstruct sea surface temperatures (U37 K\u2032 and TEX86 indices), marine primary productivity (total chlorin and alkenone mass accumulation rates), and terrestrial inputs derived from southern Africa (Ti/Al and Ca/Ti via XRF scanning) to understand the evolution of the Southeast Atlantic Ocean since the late Pliocene. In the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, ODP Site 1087 was situated within the Benguela Upwelling System, which was displaced southwards relative to present. We recognize a series of events in the proxy records at 3.3, 3.0, 2.2, 1.5, 0.9 and 0.6 Ma, which are interpreted to reflect a combination of changes in the location of major global wind and oceanic systems and local variations in the strength and/or position of the winds, which influence nutrient availability. Although there is a temporary SST cooling observed around the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG), proxy records from ODP Site 1087 show no clear climatic transition around 2.7 Ma but instead most of the changes occur before this time. This observation is significant because it has been previously suggested that there should be a change in the location and/or strength of upwelling associated with this climate transition. Rather, the main shifts at ODP Site 1087 occur at ca. 0.9 Ma and 0.6 Ma, associated with the early mid-Pleistocene transition (EMPT), with a clear loss of the previous upwelling-dominated regime. This observation raises the possibility that reorganisation of southeast Atlantic Ocean circulation towards modern conditions was tightly linked to the EMPT, but not to earlier climate transitions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aguhlas Leakage", "Benguela Upwelling", "EMPT", "Plio\u2013Plistocene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benguela", "Benguela upwelling systems", "Early-mid pleistocene", "EMPT", "Mass accumulation rates", "Northern hemisphere glaciations", "Nutrient availability", "Sea surface temperature (SST)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045123069", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"36712253800": {"Name": "Petrick B.", "AuthorID": "36712253800", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Newcastle University"}, "8663185400": {"Name": "McClymont E.", "AuthorID": "8663185400", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Durham University"}, "36126559200": {"Name": "Littler K.", "AuthorID": "36126559200", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Camborne School of Mines, Environment and Sustainability Institute, University of Exeter"}, "6603714917": {"Name": "Rosell-Mel\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "6603714917", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats"}, "55201281100": {"Name": "Clarkson M.", "AuthorID": "55201281100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, Department of Earth Sciences, ETH"}, "7003590340": {"Name": "Maslin M.", "AuthorID": "7003590340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6506989282": {"Name": "Shevenell A.", "AuthorID": "6506989282", "AffiliationID": "60030822", "AffiliationName": "College of Marine Science, University of South Florida"}, "6701635696": {"Name": "R\u00f6hl U.", "AuthorID": "6701635696", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "MARUM \u2013 Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen"}, "35273009200": {"Name": "Pancost R.", "AuthorID": "35273009200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, School of Chemistry"}}}
