Significant changes were identified for 401 proteins. Cellular response combines changes in trafficking and in total abundance to vary the local compartmental abundances that are the basis of cellular response. Appreciable changes for both perturbations were observed for 245 proteins, but cross-talk between oxidative stress and DNA replication is dominated by 49 proteins that show strong changes for both. Many nuclear processes are influenced by a spatial switch involving the proteins {KPNA2, KPNB1, PCNA, PTMA, SET} and heme/iron proteins HMOX1 and FTH1. Dynamic spatial distribution data are presented for proteins involved in caveolae, extracellular matrix remodelling, TGF\u03b2 signaling, IGF pathways, emerin complexes, mitochondrial protein import complexes, spliceosomes, proteasomes, and so on. The data indicate that for spatially heterogeneous cells cross-compartmental communication is integral to their system biology, that coordinated spatial redistribution for crucial protein networks underlies many functional changes, and that information on dynamic spatial redistribution of proteins is essential to obtain comprehensive pictures of cellular function. We describe how spatial data of the type presented here can provide priorities for further investigation of crucial features of high-level spatial coordination across cells. We suggest that the present data are related to increasing indications that much of subcellular protein transport is constitutive and that perturbation of these constitutive transport processes may be related to cancer and other diseases. A quantitative, spatially resolved nucleus-cytoplasm interaction network is provided for further investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA replication", "MS-based proteomics", "nucleus-cytoplasm interaction", "oxidative stress", "protein interaction networks", "spatial coordination", "subcellular proteomics", "transport process"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Compartmentation", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Line", "Cell Nucleus", "Cytoplasm", "DNA Replication", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Oxidative Stress", "Protein Transport", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Subcellular Fractions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973560634", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57200831760": {"Name": "Radulovic M.", "AuthorID": "57200831760", "AffiliationID": "60068842", "AffiliationName": "Insitute of Oncology and Radiology"}, "56380642900": {"Name": "Baqader N.O.", "AuthorID": "56380642900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Center for Nephrology, Royal Free Campus"}, "7005472520": {"Name": "Godovac-Zimmermann J.", "AuthorID": "7005472520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Center for Nephrology, Royal Free Campus"}, "6601949405": {"Name": "Stoeber K.", "AuthorID": "6601949405", "AffiliationID": "60007952", "AffiliationName": "Shionogi Europe"}}}
