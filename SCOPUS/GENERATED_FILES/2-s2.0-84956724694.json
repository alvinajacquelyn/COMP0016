Methods: In this multicenter cross-sectional observational study of patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH, consecutive patients with NOAC-ICH were compared to those with warfarin-ICH selected from a population of 344 patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH. ICH volume was measured by an observer blinded to clinical details. Outcome measures were ICH volume and clinical outcome adjusted for confounding factors. Results: We compared 11 patients with NOAC-ICH to 52 patients with warfarin-ICH. The median ICH volume was 2.4 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 0.3-5.4 mL) for NOAC-ICH vs 8.9 mL (IQR 4.0-21.3 mL) for warfarin-ICH (p 0.0028). In univariate linear regression, use of warfarin (difference in cube root volume 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 2.53) and lobar ICH location (compared with nonlobar ICH; difference in cube root volume 1.52; 95% CI 2.20 to 0.85) were associated with larger ICH volumes. In multivariable linear regression adjusting for confounding factors (sex, hypertension, previous ischemic stroke, white matter disease burden, and premorbid modified Rankin Scale score [MRS]), warfarin use remained independently associated with larger ICH (cube root) volumes (coefficient 0.64; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.25; p 0.042). Ordered logistic regression showed an increased odds of a worse clinical outcome (as measured by discharge MRS) in warfarin-ICH compared with NOAC-ICH: odds ratio 4.46 (95% CI 1.10 to 18.14; p 0.037). Conclusions: In this small prospective observational study, patients with NOAC-associated ICH had smaller ICH volumes and better clinical outcomes compared with warfarin-associated ICH.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anticoagulants", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Warfarin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956724694", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57202955229": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "57202955229", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36676862000": {"Name": "Charidimou A.", "AuthorID": "36676862000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56420609300": {"Name": "Brown M.M.", "AuthorID": "56420609300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57194282491": {"Name": "Shakeshaft C.", "AuthorID": "57194282491", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35189849800": {"Name": "White M.", "AuthorID": "35189849800", "AffiliationID": "100474921", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "100474921", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology"}, "26642970600": {"Name": "J\u00e4ger H.R.", "AuthorID": "26642970600", "AffiliationID": "100474921", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, UCL"}, "7402809618": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "7402809618", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15842833200": {"Name": "Al-Shahi Salman R.", "AuthorID": "15842833200", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57216675273": {"Name": "Lip G.Y.H.", "AuthorID": "57216675273", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60007419", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences, City Hospital"}}}
