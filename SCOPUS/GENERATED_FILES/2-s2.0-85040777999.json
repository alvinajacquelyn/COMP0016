KGaA, WeinheimLead tri-iodide methylammonium (MAPbI3) perovskite polycrystalline materials show complex optoelectronic behavior, largely because their 3D semiconducting inorganic framework is strongly perturbed by the organic cations and ubiquitous structural or chemical inhomogeneities. Here, a newly developed time-dependent density functional theory-based theoretical formalism is taken advantage of. It treats electron\u2013hole and electron\u2013nuclei interactions on the same footing to assess the many-body excited states of MAPbI3 perovskites in their pristine state and in the presence of point chemical defects. It is shown that lead and iodine vacancies yield deep trap states that can be healed by dynamic effects, namely rotation of the methylammonium cations in response to point charges, or through slight changes in chemical composition, namely by introducing a tiny amount of chlorine dopants in the defective MAPbI3. The theoretical results are supported by photoluminescence experiments on MAPbI3\u2212mClm and pave the way toward the design of defect-free perovskite materials with optoelectronic performance approaching the theoretical limits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chlorine doping", "healing point defects", "lead iodide perovskites", "photoluminescence intensity", "time-dependent density functional theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical compositions", "Chemical inhomogeneities", "Chlorine doping", "Lead iodide", "Methylammonium cations", "Photoluminescence intensities", "Theoretical limits", "Time dependent density functional theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040777999", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7003455408": {"Name": "Nan G.", "AuthorID": "7003455408", "AffiliationID": "60010758", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Chemistry of Novel Materials, University of Mons"}, "7004588449": {"Name": "Beljonne D.", "AuthorID": "7004588449", "AffiliationID": "60010758", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Chemistry of Novel Materials, University of Mons"}, "35263464300": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "35263464300", "AffiliationID": "60020975", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, California State University Northridge"}, "35269681100": {"Name": "Lu G.", "AuthorID": "35269681100", "AffiliationID": "60020975", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, California State University Northridge"}, "55864987800": {"Name": "Abdi-Jalebi M.", "AuthorID": "55864987800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57022043200": {"Name": "Andaji-Garmaroudi Z.", "AuthorID": "57022043200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "35224069200": {"Name": "Stranks S.", "AuthorID": "35224069200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
