All rights reserved.The high pressure stability of CoSi, RuSi, RhSi, PdSi, OsSi, IrSi and PtSi was investigated by static first-principles calculations up to 300 GPa at 0 K. As found experimentally, at atmospheric pressure, CoSi, RuSi and OsSi were found to adopt the cubic \u03b5-FeSi structure (P213) whereas RhSi, PdSi, IrSi and PtSi were found to adopt the orthorhombic MnP (Pnma) structure. At high pressure, CoSi, RuSi and OsSi show a phase transition to the CsCl structure (Pm3\u00afm) structure at 270 GPa, 7 GPa and 6 GPa respectively. RhSi and IrSi were found to transform to an \u03b5-FeSi structure at 10 GPa and 25 GPa. For PdSi and PtSi, a transformation from the MnP structure to the tetragonal CuTi structure (P4/nmm) occurs at 13 GPa and 20 GPa. The pressure dependence of the electronic density of states reveals that RuSi and OsSi are semiconductors in the \u03b5-FeSi structure and become metallic in the CsCl structure. RhSi and IrSi are metals in the MnP structure and become semimetals in their high pressure \u03b5-FeSi form. CoSi in the \u03b5-FeSi configuration is a semimetal. PdSi and PtSi remain metallic throughout up to 300 GPa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic structure", "First-principles calculations", "High pressure", "Phase transition", "Transition metal monosilicides"], "IndexKeywords": ["CsCl structure", "First-principles calculation", "High pressure", "Platinum group elements", "Pressure dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920067302", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57188720656": {"Name": "Hernandez J.", "AuthorID": "57188720656", "AffiliationID": "60108653, 60023578", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de G\u00e9ologie de Lyon, CNRS UMR 5276, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
