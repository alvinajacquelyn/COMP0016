However, little is known about the acceptability to women of this strategy. We aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of women's perceptions and previous experiences of ovarian cancer symptom management, and the influences on ovarian cancer awareness and anticipated symptom presentation. Method: Qualitative interviews were conducted with eight women at increased risk of ovarian cancer who had previously taken part in ovarian cancer screening and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results: Familial experience of ovarian cancer and perceived personal risk shaped women's perceptions and behavioural responses to disease threat. Ovarian cancer information was perceived to be a double-edged sword, regarded as either useful for increasing knowledge and confidence in discussing symptom concerns with health professionals or to be avoided due to fears about cancer. Conclusion: Women may be cautious about searching for information independently and in the absence of routine ovarian screening. Practice implications: Thought needs to be given to how best to create and disseminate credible ovarian cancer symptom information materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Family history", "Ovarian cancer", "Perceived risk", "Qualitative", "Symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978977106", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56097009900": {"Name": "Smits S.", "AuthorID": "56097009900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Divison of Population Medicine, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Neuadd, Meirionnydd"}, "7005692978": {"Name": "Brain K.", "AuthorID": "7005692978", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Divison of Population Medicine, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Neuadd, Meirionnydd"}, "7103033462": {"Name": "Boivin J.", "AuthorID": "7103033462", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
