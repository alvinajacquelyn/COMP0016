All rights reserved.Second-order discrete equations are studied over the field of rational functions C(z), where z is a variable not appearing in the equation. The exact degree of each iterate as a function of z can be calculated easily using the standard calculations that arise in singularity confinement analysis, even when the singularities are not confined. This produces elementary yet rigorous entropy calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algebraic entropy", "Discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations", "Singularity confinement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Confinement analysis", "Discrete equations", "Exact calculations", "Second orders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020129775", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603577604": {"Name": "Halburd R.", "AuthorID": "6603577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
