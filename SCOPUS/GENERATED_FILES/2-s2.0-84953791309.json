Taking into account imperfect channel state information (CSI) caused by pilot contamination, we derive exact closed-form expressions of the per-user achievable ergodic rate with arbitrary pilot reuse factors. After that, we first reveal that the user terminals, which are geographically separated with large distance between each other, can reuse pilot, suffering only low pilot contamination. Based on this insight, we further propose a low-complexity pilot reuse algorithm based on the minimum sum of estimation error criterion. Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed pilot reuse algorithm is very effective in suppressing pilot contamination in SCN.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953791309", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55231762300": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "55231762300", "AffiliationID": "60021783", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information, Nantong University"}, "56493254100": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56493254100", "AffiliationID": "60104290", "AffiliationName": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}, "57200646797": {"Name": "Xu C.", "AuthorID": "57200646797", "AffiliationID": "60021783", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information, Nantong University"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7403872378": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "7403872378", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
