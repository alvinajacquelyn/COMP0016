Recent studies have revealed that this cancer-preventive process involves the interaction with the surrounding normal epithelial cells; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. In this study, using mammalian cell culture and zebrafish embryo systems, we have elucidated the functional involvement of endocytosis in the elimination of RasV12- transformed cells. First, we show that Rab5, a crucial regulator of endocytosis, is accumulated in RasV12-transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells, which is accompanied by upregulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Addition of chlorpromazine or coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Rab5 suppresses apical extrusion of RasV12 cells from the epithelium. We also show in zebrafish embryos that Rab5 plays an important role in the elimination of transformed cells from the enveloping layer epithelium. In addition, Rab5-mediated endocytosis of E-cadherin is enhanced at the boundary between normal and RasV12 cells. Rab5 functions upstream of epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN), which plays a positive role in apical extrusion of RasV12 cells by regulating protein kinase A. Furthermore, we have revealed that epithelial defense against cancer (EDAC) from normal epithelial cells substantially impacts on Rab5 accumulation in the neighboring transformed cells. This report demonstrates that Rab5-mediated endocytosis is a crucial regulator for the competitive interaction between normal and transformed epithelial cells in mammals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apical extrusion", "Cell competition", "Endocytosis", "Rab5", "RasV12"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Endocytosis", "Epithelium", "rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Transformation, Genetic", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016089220", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56310903700": {"Name": "Saitoh S.", "AuthorID": "56310903700", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "55932873500": {"Name": "Maruyama T.", "AuthorID": "55932873500", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "56309984800": {"Name": "Yako Y.", "AuthorID": "56309984800", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "8876218600": {"Name": "Kajita M.", "AuthorID": "8876218600", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biodefense Research, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University"}, "57197599356": {"Name": "Kasai N.", "AuthorID": "57197599356", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "57193725773": {"Name": "Sugama N.", "AuthorID": "57193725773", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University"}, "13905969200": {"Name": "Kon S.", "AuthorID": "13905969200", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "55708325400": {"Name": "Ishikawa S.", "AuthorID": "55708325400", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "57199478003": {"Name": "Fujita Y.", "AuthorID": "57199478003", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "57193719877": {"Name": "Hayashi T.", "AuthorID": "57193719877", "AffiliationID": "60026555", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Technology Research Center, Tokushima Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd."}, "21742617000": {"Name": "Fujioka Y.", "AuthorID": "21742617000", "AffiliationID": "60171692", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Physiology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7201839837": {"Name": "Ohba Y.", "AuthorID": "7201839837", "AffiliationID": "60171692", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Physiology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "51562959800": {"Name": "Yamazaki T.", "AuthorID": "51562959800", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Division of RNA Biofunction, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University"}, "7403302053": {"Name": "Tada M.", "AuthorID": "7403302053", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
