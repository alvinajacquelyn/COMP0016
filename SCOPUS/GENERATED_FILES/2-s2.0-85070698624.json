Initiatives which empower individuals with intellectual disabilities to improve their health, develop living skills or manage chronic illnesses may promote independence and reduce unnecessary dependency on social services. Methods: A \u201cpreventative framework\u201d to managing demand comprising several domains was developed from existing literature to guide the search strategy. Results: Fourteen papers related to three domains in the predetermined preventative framework were selected for inclusion in the review, including twelve economic studies. Outcomes included measurement of care needs, and cost-comparison between social care models or cost-effectiveness of interventions. Due to the heterogeneity, the present authors were not able to quantitatively synthesize findings. Conclusions: The present authors conclude that evidence linking initiatives across sectors to demand for adult social care is lacking. The present authors identify several gaps in the literature and make recommendations for future research and data recording in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intellectual disability", "learning disability", "managing demand", "social care", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Mentally Disabled Persons", "Social Work"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070698624", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"36834426700": {"Name": "Rojas-Garcia A.", "AuthorID": "36834426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, University College London"}, "26025760100": {"Name": "Woodhead C.", "AuthorID": "26025760100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, University College London"}, "6603187818": {"Name": "Aspinal F.", "AuthorID": "6603187818", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, University College London"}, "57210435986": {"Name": "Imwensi E.", "AuthorID": "57210435986", "AffiliationID": "122988777", "AffiliationName": "Adult Social Services, Redbridge Council"}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities Research, University College London"}}}
