It is different in composition, texture, and conditions of formation from high-purity platinum of other regions described in the literature. The main characteristics of investigated high-purity platinum are colloform-layered texture, admixture of Fe (0.37\u20130.78 wt%), and paragenesis of Cu-rich isoferroplatinum, hongshiite, and rhodarsenide. The PGM grain with high-purity platinum is multiphase and heterogeneous in texture. It is a product of intensive metasomatic transformation of Cu-rich isoferroplatinum (Pt3(Fe0.6Cu0.4)). The transformation was carried out in two stages: 1 \u2013 copper stage including three substages (Cu-rich isoferroplatinum, copper platinum and hongshiite); and 2 \u2013 arsenic (rhodarsenide). The formation of high-purity platinum was separated in time from the formation of isoferroplatinum and was carried out by precipitation from postmagmatic solutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alluvial placer", "Cu-rich isoferroplatinum", "Gornaya Shoriya", "High-purity platinum", "Hongshiite", "Platinum-group elements (PGE)", "Platinum-group minerals (PGM)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alluvial placers", "Gornaya Shoriya", "High purity", "Hongshiite", "Isoferroplatinum", "Platinum group elements", "Platinum group minerals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031429543", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Economic Geology", "EART", "1905"]], "AuthorData": {"7004495914": {"Name": "Nesterenko G.", "AuthorID": "7004495914", "AffiliationID": "60073372, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "V.S.
