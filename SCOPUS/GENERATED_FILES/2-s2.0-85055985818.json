Published by IOP Publishing Ltd on behalf of Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.We derive the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) from a random matrix Hamiltonian by extending the model introduced by Deutsch (1991 Phys. Rev. A 43 2046). We approximate the coupling between a subsystem and a many-body environment by means of a random Gaussian matrix. We show that a common assumption in the analysis of quantum chaotic systems, namely the treatment of eigenstates as independent random vectors, leads to inconsistent results. However, a consistent approach to the ETH can be developed by introducing an interaction between random wave-functions that arises as a result of the orthonormality condition. This approach leads to a consistent form for off-diagonal matrix elements of observables. From there we obtain the scaling of time-averaged fluctuations of generic observables with system size for which we calculate an analytic form in terms of the inverse participation ratio. The analytic results are compared to exact diagonalizations of a quantum spin chain for different physical observables in multiple parameter regimes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["eigenstate thermalization hypothesis", "quantum non-equilibrium physics", "quantum thermalization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Multiple parameters", "Non-equilibrium physics", "Off-diagonal matrix elements", "Participation ratios", "Quantum chaotic systems", "Quantum spin chains", "Random matrix theory", "Thermalization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055985818", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57204530674": {"Name": "Nation C.", "AuthorID": "57204530674", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "24338873900": {"Name": "Porras D.", "AuthorID": "24338873900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}}}
