GO describes cellular and organismal processes across all species, yet until now there has been a considerable gene annotation deficit within the neurological and immunological domains, both of which are relevant to Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here we introduce the Parkinson\u2019s disease GO Annotation Project, funded by Parkinson\u2019s UK and supported by the GO Consortium, which is addressing this deficit by providing GO annotation to Parkinson\u2019s-relevant human gene products, principally through expert literature curation. We discuss the steps taken to prioritise proteins, publications and cellular processes for annotation, examples of how GO annotations capture Parkinson\u2019s-relevant information, and the advantages that a topic-focused annotation approach offers to users. Building on the existing GO resource, this project collates a vast amount of Parkinson\u2019s-relevant literature into a set of high-quality annotations to be utilized by the research community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Annotation, database", "Functional annotation", "Gene ontology", "High-throughput analysis", "Parkinson\u2019s disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Gene Ontology", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955600275", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"6602253196": {"Name": "Foulger R.", "AuthorID": "6602253196", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57201840868": {"Name": "Denny P.", "AuthorID": "57201840868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7003921726": {"Name": "Lovering R.", "AuthorID": "7003921726", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57035737800": {"Name": "Martin M.", "AuthorID": "57035737800", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60026124, 60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "37665989600": {"Name": "Sawford T.", "AuthorID": "37665989600", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60026124, 60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}}}
