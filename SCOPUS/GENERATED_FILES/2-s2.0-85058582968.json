Analysed samples have provided evidence for plant use and cultivation of sorghum alongside the use of a range of other taxa. The results from this study illustrate that as late as the early second millennium BC, the inhabitants of Kassala were still exploiting a mixture of morphologically wild and domesticated Sorghum bicolor. The evidence suggests that while the domestication process of sorghum was underway, full domestication may not have been reached at this time. We can hence classify this as part of the pre-domestication cultivation stage for Sorghum bicolor, which can be inferred to have begun at least two thousand years earlier. Wild taxa that may also have been exploited for food include Brachiaria sp., Rottboellia cochinchinensis (itchgrass), and apparently mixed wild and domesticated Pennisetum glaucum (pearl millet). This study also provides the first archaeobotanical evidence for Adansonia digitata (baobab) in northeastern Africa. Taken together these data suggest that Kassala was part of an early core area for sorghum domestication and played an important role in the diffusion of Africa crops including pearl millet to Asia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adansonia digitata", "Agriculture", "Archaeobotany palaeoethnobotany", "Nubia", "Pearl millet", "Sorghum"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058582968", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57160304000": {"Name": "Beldados A.", "AuthorID": "57160304000", "AffiliationID": "60071181", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management, Addis Ababa University"}, "8383681700": {"Name": "Manzo A.", "AuthorID": "8383681700", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Asian, African and Mediterranean Studies, University of Naples, \u201cL\u2019Orientale\u201d"}, "55500340100": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "55500340100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "26034718600": {"Name": "Stevens C.J.", "AuthorID": "26034718600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
