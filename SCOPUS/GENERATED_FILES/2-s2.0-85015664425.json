Despite such data having been available for several decades, the evidence base for psychological interventions to support parental well-being is small. Recent data suggest that both mindfulness and acceptance processes are associated with decreased psychological distress for parents of children with intellectual disability and/or autism. In addition, some controlled evaluations of mindfulness-based interventions for these parents have resulted in positive outcomes for mothers in particular. In the present study 18 mothers and 3 fathers were recruited via special schools who then attended a Mindfulness Based Well-Being for Parents (MBW-P) group over eight weeks. Parents completed questionnaire measures before and at the end of the course. Statistical analysis showed significant reported increases in mindfulness and self-compassion, and reduced general stress. Parents also reported reductions in anxiety and depression, although these changes were not statistically significant. No significant reductions in their child\u2019s behaviour problems or increases in the child\u2019s prosocial behaviour were found. Parents also reported high levels of satisfaction with the course. These preliminary data suggest that further research studies testing the effectiveness of the MBW-P course are warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "fathers", "intellectual disability", "mindfulness", "mothers", "psychological acceptance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015664425", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Health Professions (miscellaneous)", "HEAL", "3601"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"55547806200": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "55547806200", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "35191695000": {"Name": "Gold E.", "AuthorID": "35191695000", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "57199028643": {"Name": "Jones M.", "AuthorID": "57199028643", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "57193670731": {"Name": "Griffiths A.", "AuthorID": "57193670731", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "36026961600": {"Name": "Silverton S.", "AuthorID": "36026961600", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "12760208200": {"Name": "Totsika V.", "AuthorID": "12760208200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick"}, "7102719472": {"Name": "Hastings R.", "AuthorID": "7102719472", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick"}}}
