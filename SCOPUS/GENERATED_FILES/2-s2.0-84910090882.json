The literacy scores of the deaf children and the hearing children with dyslexia were lower than expected for children of their age and did not differ from each other. Three quarters of the spelling errors of hearing children with dyslexia compared with just over half the errors of the oral deaf group were phonologically plausible. Expressive vocabulary and speech intelligibility predicted the percentage of phonologically plausible errors in the deaf group only. Implications of findings for the phonological decoding self-teaching model and for supporting literacy development are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deaf", "Dyslexia", "Phonological", "Reading", "Spelling", "Vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84910090882", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"16204156600": {"Name": "Roy P.", "AuthorID": "16204156600", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Language and Communication Science, City University London"}, "56415071500": {"Name": "Shergold Z.", "AuthorID": "56415071500", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Language and Communication Science, City University London"}, "6603065051": {"Name": "Kyle F.", "AuthorID": "6603065051", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Language and Communication Science, City University London"}, "14819412400": {"Name": "Herman R.", "AuthorID": "14819412400", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Language and Communication Science, City University London"}}}
