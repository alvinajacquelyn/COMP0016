Two main aspects of sorting algorithms which have been studied extensively are complexity and correctness. [Foley and Hoare, 1971] published the first formal correctness proof of a sorting algorithm (Quicksort). While this is a handwritten proof, the development and application of (semi)-automated theorem provers has since taken a huge flight. The major sorting algorithms Insertion sort, Heapsort and Quicksort were proven correct by Filli\u00e2tre and Magaud [1999] using the proof assistant Coq. Recently, Sternagel [2013] formalized a proof of Mergesort within the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automated theorem prover", "Development and applications", "Formal correctness", "Interactive theorem prover", "Proof assistant", "Quicksort", "Radix sort", "Sorting algorithm"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007022777", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"39161280900": {"Name": "de Gouw S.", "AuthorID": "39161280900", "AffiliationID": "60024360", "AffiliationName": "Open University"}, "55560517200": {"Name": "De Boer F.", "AuthorID": "55560517200", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica"}, "55305790900": {"Name": "Rot J.", "AuthorID": "55305790900", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University"}}}
