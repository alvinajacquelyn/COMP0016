Eradication of lower respiratory infections is arduous, leading to high healthcare costs and requiring higher doses of antibiotics to reach optimal concentrations at the site of pulmonary infection for protracted periods. Hence direct inhalation to the respiratory epithelium has been investigated extensively in the past decade, and seems to be an attractive approach to eradicate and hence overcome this widespread problem. Moreover, engineering inhalation formulations wherein the antibiotics are encapsulated within nanoscale carriers could serve to overcome many of the limitations faced by conventional antibiotics, like difficulty in treating intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria spp. and salmonella spp., biofilmassociated pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, passage through the sputum associated with disorders like cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, systemic side effects following oral/parenteral delivery and inadequate concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection leading to resistance. Encapsulation of antibiotics in nanocarriers may help in providing a protective environment to combat antibiotic degradation, confer controlled-release properties, hence reducing dosing frequency, and may increase uptake via specific and non-specific targeting modalities. Hence nanotechnology combined with direct administration to the airways using commercially available delivery devices, is a highly attractive formulation strategy to eradicate microorganisms from the lower respiratory tract, which might otherwise present opportunities for multi-drug resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacterial resistance", "Biofilm", "Cystic fibrosis", "Infection", "Liposome", "Nanoparticle", "Pulmonary", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Inhalation", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Chronic Disease", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Lung", "Nanomedicine", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974706805", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"55962273000": {"Name": "Merchant Z.", "AuthorID": "55962273000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7006070050": {"Name": "Buckton G.", "AuthorID": "7006070050", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7403523237": {"Name": "Taylor K.M.G.", "AuthorID": "7403523237", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical & Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "24831973500": {"Name": "Saleem I.Y.", "AuthorID": "24831973500", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy & Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "18042756100": {"Name": "Zariwala M.G.", "AuthorID": "18042756100", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science & Technology, University of Westminster"}}}
