Through interviews, participatory mapping and observation, we explored how these ideas relate to people's notions about the natural environment in a rural community on the Eastern Tibetan plateau, in Sichuan Province, China. We found people to be orienting themselves towards the environment by means of three interlinked religious notions: (1) local gods and spirits in the landscape, which have become the focus of conservation efforts in the form of 'sacred natural sites;' (2) sin and karma related to killing animals and plants; (3) Buddhist moral precepts especially non-violence. We highlight the gaps between externally generated representations and local understandings, but also the dynamic, contested and plural nature of local relationships with the environment, which have been influenced and reshaped by capitalist development and commodification of natural resources, state environmental policies, and Buddhist modernist ideas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buddhism", "China", "Conservation", "Religion", "Sacred sites", "Tibetan Plateau"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929045584", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55968004200": {"Name": "Woodhouse E.", "AuthorID": "55968004200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003731704": {"Name": "Milner-Gulland E.J.", "AuthorID": "7003731704", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "14919361100": {"Name": "Mills M.A.", "AuthorID": "14919361100", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "University of Aberdeen"}, "7004854418": {"Name": "McGowan P.J.K.", "AuthorID": "7004854418", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University"}}}
