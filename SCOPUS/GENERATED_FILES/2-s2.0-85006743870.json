The motivation was to study the feasibility of flow pattern map actuation by using a transverse cylinder immersed in water in the stratified pattern, and particularly the transition from separated to dispersed flows. The cylinder has a diameter of 5 mm and is located at 6.75 mm from the bottom of the pipe in a 37 mm ID acrylic test section. Velocity profiles were obtained in the middle plane of the pipe. For reference, single phase flows were also investigated for Reynolds numbers from 1550 to 3488. It was found that the flow behind the cylinder was similar to the two dimensional cases, while the presence of the lower pipe wall diverted the vorticity layers towards the top. In two-phase flows, the Froude number (from 1.4 to 1.8) and the depth of the cylinder submergence below the interface affected the generation of waves. For high Froude numbers and low depths of submergence the counter rotating von Karman vortices generated by the cylinder interacted with the interface. In this case, the vorticity clusters from the top of the cylinder were seen to attach at the wave crests. At high depths of submergence, a jet like flow appeared between the top of the cylinder and the interface. High speed imaging revealed that the presence of the cylinder reduced to lower mixture velocities the transition from separated to dual continuous flows where drops of one phase appear into the other.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bluff body", "Dispersed flow", "Flow pattern map actuation", "Oil-water flow", "PIV measurements", "Stratified flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bluff body", "Dispersed flow", "Flow pattern map", "Oil water flow", "PIV measurements", "Stratified flows"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006743870", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"55516616200": {"Name": "Chinaud M.", "AuthorID": "55516616200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57188632646": {"Name": "Park K.H.", "AuthorID": "57188632646", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
