Beyond quantum computation, these arrays are useful integrated analog simulators for many-body models. As entanglement between individual spins is extremely short ranged in these models, one has to measure the entanglement entropy of a block in order to truly verify their many-body entangled nature. Remarkably, the characteristic scaling of entanglement entropy, predicted by conformal field theory, has yet to be measured. Here, we show that with as few as two replicas of a spin array, and capacitive double-dot singlet-triplet measurements on neighboring spin pairs, the above scaling of the entanglement entropy can be verified. This opens up the controlled simulation of quantum field theories, as we exemplify with uniform chains and Kondo-type impurity models, in engineered solid-state systems. Our procedure remains effective even in the presence of typical imperfections of realistic quantum devices and can be used for thermometry, and to bound entanglement and discord in mixed many-body states.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009761525", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"8910867800": {"Name": "Banchi L.", "AuthorID": "8910867800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8958172800": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "8958172800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
