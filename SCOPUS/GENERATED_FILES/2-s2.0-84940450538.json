Here, a mathematical description of this process is formulated, adapted from Friedrich et al. (Phys Rev E, 74:041103, 2006b). The approach allows the specification any running or waiting time distribution along with any angular and speed distributions. The resulting system of integro-partial differential equations is tumultuous, and therefore, it is necessary to both simplify and derive summary statistics. An expression for the mean squared displacement is derived, which shows good agreement with experimental data from the bacterium Escherichia coli and the gull Larus fuscus. Finally, a large time diffusive approximation is considered via a Cattaneo approximation (Hillen in Discrete Continuous Dyn Syst Ser B, 5:299\u2013318, 2003). This leads to the novel result that the effective diffusion constant is dependent on the mean and variance of the running time distribution but only on the mean of the waiting time distribution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brownian limit", "Effective diffusion", "Mean squared displacement", "Non-Markov correlated random walk", "Transport equations", "Velocity jump process"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Migration", "Animals", "Bacterial Physiological Phenomena", "Birds", "Charadriiformes", "Computer Simulation", "Escherichia coli", "Mathematical Concepts", "Models, Biological", "Movement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940450538", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"56677709600": {"Name": "Taylor-King J.P.", "AuthorID": "56677709600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7403045089": {"Name": "Chapman S.J.", "AuthorID": "7403045089", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7004408790": {"Name": "van Loon E.E.", "AuthorID": "7004408790", "AffiliationID": "60028596, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam"}, "36186157200": {"Name": "Rosser G.", "AuthorID": "36186157200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, UCL"}}}
