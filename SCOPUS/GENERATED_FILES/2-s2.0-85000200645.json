These findings suggest that interspecies differences must be considered when evaluating drug effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a model-based approach to assess the risk of QTc prolongation for three investigational compounds (NCE01, NCE02 and NCE03). Methods Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from experiments in conscious dogs and healthy subjects were included in this analysis. Pharmacokinetic modelling and deconvolution methods were applied to derive drug concentrations at the time of each QT measurement. An integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model was then used to describe QT prolongation. A threshold of \u226510 ms was used to characterize the probability of QTc prolongation. Results The PKPD relationships of all three compounds were successfully described in both species. A strong effect was observed after administration of NCE01 to dogs and humans, with a slope of 0.0061 and 0.0662 ms nm-1, respectively, and maximal probability of QTc prolongation \u226510 ms at peak concentration. For NCE02 and NCE03, QTc-shortening and borderline QT effects were observed both in dogs and humans, as described by negative or very shallow slopes (NCE02, -0.00098 and -0.01 ms nm-1; NCE03, 0.00064 and -0.0002 ms nm-1). Conclusions Whilst NEC01 shows clear pro-arrhythmic effects, the liability for QT/QTc prolongation for NCE02 and NCE03 can be deemed low at the expected therapeutic exposure. Moreover, our results show the advantages of an integrated PKPD approach as the basis for translating pro-arrhythmic effects from dogs to humans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian modelling", "cardiovascular safety", "drug development", "pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling", "QT interval prolongation", "translational pharmacology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Dogs", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Discovery", "Drugs, Investigational", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Long QT Syndrome", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Translational Medical Research", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000200645", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55913017600": {"Name": "Dubois V.", "AuthorID": "55913017600", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University"}, "55827309300": {"Name": "Yu H.", "AuthorID": "55827309300", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University"}, "7101741871": {"Name": "Danhof M.", "AuthorID": "7101741871", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, School of Life and Medical Sciences, UCL"}}}
