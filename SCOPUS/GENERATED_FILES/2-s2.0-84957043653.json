The depth and excellent image quality of the RCS2 enabled us to detect the cluster-mass cross-correlation up to z \u223c 0.7. To obtain cluster masses, concentrations, and halo biases, we fit a cluster halo model simultaneously to the lensing signal and to the projected density profile of red-sequence cluster members, because the latter provides tight constraints on the cluster miscentring distribution. We parametrised the mass-richness relation as M200 = A \u00d7 (N200/ 20)\u03b1 and find A =(15.0\u00b10.8)\u00d71013 h70-1 M and \u03b1 = 0.73 \u00b1 0.07 at low redshift (0.2 < z < 0.35). At intermediate redshift (0.35 < z < 0.55), we find a higher normalisation, which points towards a fractional increase in the richness towards lower redshift caused by the build-up of the red sequence. The miscentring distribution is well constrained. Only \u223c30% of our BCGs coincide with the peak of the dark matter distribution. The distribution of the remaining BCGs are modelled with a 2D-Gaussian, whose width increases from 0.2 to 0.4 h70-1 Mpc towards higher masses. The ratio of width and r200 is constant with mass and has an average value of 0.44 \u00b1 0.01. The mass-concentration and mass-bias relations agree fairly well with literature results at low redshift, but have a higher normalisation at higher redshifts, possibly because of selection and projection effects. The concentration of the satellite distribution decreases with mass and is correlated to the concentration of the halo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: clusters: general", "Gravitational lensing: weak"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross correlations", "Galaxies: clusters: General", "Galaxy clusters", "Gravitational lensing: weak", "Mass concentration", "Projected density", "Projection effects", "Scaling relations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957043653", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"37068260900": {"Name": "Van Uitert E.", "AuthorID": "37068260900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Gower Street"}, "7102513091": {"Name": "Hoekstra H.", "AuthorID": "7102513091", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "14008781100": {"Name": "Semboloni E.", "AuthorID": "14008781100", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "6506165456": {"Name": "Gilbank D.G.", "AuthorID": "6506165456", "AffiliationID": "60002356", "AffiliationName": "South African Astronomical Observatory"}, "6701538780": {"Name": "Gladders M.D.", "AuthorID": "6701538780", "AffiliationID": "60117873, 60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago"}, "56599968100": {"Name": "Yee H.K.C.", "AuthorID": "56599968100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto"}}}
