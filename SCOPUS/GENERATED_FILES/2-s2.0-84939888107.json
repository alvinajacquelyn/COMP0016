However, whether or not the self-renewal program is retained from stem cells or conferred on progenitors by leukemogenic molecules remains unknown. We have addressed the issue in the context of TEL-AML1-associated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by profiling a refined program edited from genes essential for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and B-cell development. Bioinformatic analysis shows that ALL populations are loosely clustered and close to the normal population that contains stem and primitive progenitor cells. This finding indicates that immunophenotypes do not reflect maturation stages in ALL and that the self-renewal program may be retained from stem cells. Results of assessing 'first hit' function of TEL-AML1 in different populations of normal cells demonstrate the molecular model. Therefore, the current study shows a leukemogenic scenario of human ALL in which programs of stem cells are sustained in distinct fractions by leukemogenic mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antigens, CD19", "Antigens, CD34", "Antigens, CD38", "B-Lymphocytes", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mutation", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Oncogene Proteins, Fusion", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939888107", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57220921602": {"Name": "Fan D.", "AuthorID": "57220921602", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073471", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM)"}, "56442968400": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "56442968400", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073471", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM)"}, "13907115100": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "13907115100", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073471", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM)"}, "8631116200": {"Name": "Hong D.", "AuthorID": "8631116200", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM"}, "56190907400": {"Name": "Zhou X.", "AuthorID": "56190907400", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM"}, "57191700523": {"Name": "Li Z.Q.", "AuthorID": "57191700523", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM"}, "57192074217": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "57192074217", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM"}, "57201409516": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "57201409516", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM"}, "46061452200": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "46061452200", "AffiliationID": "60024452", "AffiliationName": "Ruijin Hospital, SJTU-SM"}, "55588958900": {"Name": "Duan C.", "AuthorID": "55588958900", "AffiliationID": "60024452", "AffiliationName": "Ruijin Hospital, SJTU-SM"}, "57213151608": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "57213151608", "AffiliationID": "60024452", "AffiliationName": "Ruijin Hospital, SJTU-SM"}, "55670132700": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55670132700", "AffiliationID": "112792976", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Cord Blood Bank"}, "56953952100": {"Name": "Gao F.", "AuthorID": "56953952100", "AffiliationID": "112792976", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Cord Blood Bank"}, "55712450300": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "55712450300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57205499442": {"Name": "Gupta R.", "AuthorID": "57205499442", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7006621281": {"Name": "Enver T.", "AuthorID": "7006621281", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
