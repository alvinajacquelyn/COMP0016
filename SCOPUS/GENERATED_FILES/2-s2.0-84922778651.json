The role of NK cells in children infected perinatally with HBV is less studied. Access to a unique cohort enabled the cross-sectional evaluation of NK cell frequency, phenotype and function in HBV-infected children relative to uninfected children. We observed a selective defect in NK cell interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production, with conserved cytolytic function, mirroring the functional dichotomy observed in adult infection. Reduced expression of NKp30 on NK cells suggests a role of impaired NK-dendritic cell (DC) cellular interactions as a potential mechanism leading to reduced IFN-\u03b3 production. The finding that NK cells are already defective in paediatric CHB, albeit less extensively than in adult CHB, has potential implications for the timing of anti-viral therapy aiming to restore immune control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-viral function", "IFN-\u03b3", "NK cells", "NKp30", "Paediatric HBV infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antigens, Viral", "Cell Communication", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Dendritic Cells", "Down-Regulation", "Female", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B virus", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Male", "Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922778651", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"6603440163": {"Name": "Heiberg I.L.", "AuthorID": "6603440163", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60002327", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "8593810100": {"Name": "Winther T.N.", "AuthorID": "8593810100", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60002327", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "35233362400": {"Name": "H\u00f8gh B.", "AuthorID": "35233362400", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60002327", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "55613142700": {"Name": "Pallett L.J.", "AuthorID": "55613142700", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "24171517900": {"Name": "Peppa D.", "AuthorID": "24171517900", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}}}
