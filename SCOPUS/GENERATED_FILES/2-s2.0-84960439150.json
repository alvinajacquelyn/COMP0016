Depending on the stage of granulation, the binder material can be in the solid or liquid phase. The outcome of these collisions controls the dynamics of the granulation process and the fundamental physics of the impacts are of interest. This paper examines the impact of glass beads (model particles) and solid Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG) flakes on a substrate of PEG as the temperature of the PEG layer is increased from below its melting point to above it. While the layer is in the solid state, the result of the impact can be quantified by the coefficient of restitution. When the layer is in the liquid state, the impact can be quantified by the immersion behaviour. The results obtained show that the coefficient of restitution between either glass beads and PEG flakes and the PEG layer is strongly affected by temperatures. As the PEG layer approaches its melting point, the coefficient of restitution falls to zero. Once the temperature of the PEG layer exceeds the melting point, the impact is characterised by a transient maximum indentation and then rebound to an equilibrium position. These too are strongly dependent on temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binder melting", "Coefficient of restitution", "Granulation", "Impact"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binder material", "Coefficient of restitution", "Effect of temperature", "Equilibrium positions", "Fundamental physics", "Granulation process", "Impact", "Liquid Phase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960439150", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56045992600": {"Name": "Grau-Bove J.", "AuthorID": "56045992600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, UCL"}, "15063074100": {"Name": "Mangwandi C.", "AuthorID": "15063074100", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "35583992400": {"Name": "Walker G.", "AuthorID": "35583992400", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Materials Surface Science Institute, Department of Chemical and Environmental Sciences, University of Limerick"}, "37108372700": {"Name": "Ring D.", "AuthorID": "37108372700", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University College Cork"}, "7005129123": {"Name": "Cronin K.", "AuthorID": "7005129123", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University College Cork"}}}
