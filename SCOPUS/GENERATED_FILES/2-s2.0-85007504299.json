The Authors.The magnetospheric cusp is a funnel-shaped region where shocked solar wind plasma is able to enter the high-latitude magnetosphere via the process of magnetic reconnection. The plasma observations include various cusp signatures such as ion energy dispersions and diamagnetic effects. We present an overview analysis of cusp plasma observations at the Saturnian magnetosphere from the Cassini spacecraft era. A comparison of the observations is made as well as classification into groups due to varying characteristics. The locations of the reconnection site are calculated and shown to vary along the subsolar magnetopause. We show the first in situ evidence for lobe reconnection that occurred at nearly the same time as dayside reconnection for one of the cusp crossings. Evidence for \u201cbursty\u201d and more \u201ccontinuous\u201d reconnection signatures is observed at different cusp events. The events are compared to solar wind propagation models, and it is shown that magnetic reconnection and plasma injection into the cusp can occur for a variety of upstream conditions. These are important results because they show that Saturn's magnetospheric interaction with the solar wind and the resulting cusp signatures are dynamic and that plasma injection in the cusp occurs due to a variety of solar wind conditions. Furthermore, reconnection can proceed at a variety of locations along the magnetopause.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cassini", "cusp", "dispersion", "magnetosphere", "reconnection", "Saturn"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007504299", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"54989742600": {"Name": "Jasinski J.M.", "AuthorID": "54989742600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences, UCL/Birkbeck"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences, UCL/Birkbeck"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences, UCL/Birkbeck"}, "8220350900": {"Name": "Arridge C.S.", "AuthorID": "8220350900", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "55926094700": {"Name": "Sergis N.", "AuthorID": "55926094700", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Office for Space Research and Technology, Academy of Athens"}, "7201684901": {"Name": "Thomsen M.F.", "AuthorID": "7201684901", "AffiliationID": "60012944", "AffiliationName": "Planetary Science Institute"}, "6602572884": {"Name": "Reisenfeld D.B.", "AuthorID": "6602572884", "AffiliationID": "60022355", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Montana"}, "22134695900": {"Name": "Krupp N.", "AuthorID": "22134695900", "AffiliationID": "60017695", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnensystemforschung"}, "35420462300": {"Name": "Waite J.H.", "AuthorID": "35420462300", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Research Institute"}}}
