To understand the network architecture of patient flow, we performed a data-driven network analysis of patient flow through two acute hospital sites of King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Administration databases were queried for all intra-hospital patient transfers in an 18-month period and modelled as a dynamic weighted directed graph. A \u2018core\u2019 subnetwork containing only 13\u201317% of all edges channelled 83\u201390% of the patient flow, while an \u2018ephemeral\u2019 network constituted the remainder. Unsupervised cluster analysis and differential network analysis identified sub-networks where traffic is most associated with A&E performance. Increased flow to clinical decision units was associated with the best A&E performance in both sites. The component analysis also detected a weekend effect on patient transfers which was not associated with performance. We have performed the first data-driven hypothesis-free analysis of patient flow which can enhance understanding of whole healthcare systems. Such analysis can drive transformation in healthcare as it has in industries such as manufacturing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Emergency Service, Hospital", "Hospitals, Public", "State Medicine", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030256219", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55971358800": {"Name": "Bean D.M.", "AuthorID": "55971358800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57195934717": {"Name": "Stringer C.", "AuthorID": "57195934717", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192207134": {"Name": "Beeknoo N.", "AuthorID": "57192207134", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "11940769800": {"Name": "Teo J.", "AuthorID": "11940769800", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
