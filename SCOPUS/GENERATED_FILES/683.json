Previously, using cell-type-specific anatomical projection mapping, it was shown that multimodal pathways converge onto individual cerebellar granule cells (Huang et al., 2013). Here we directly measure synaptic currents using in vivo patch-clamp recordings and confirm that a subset of single granule cells receive convergent functional multimodal (somatosensory, auditory, and visual) inputs via separate mossy fibers. Furthermore, we show that the integration of multimodal signals by granule cells can enhance action potential output. These recordings directly demonstrate functional convergence of multimodal signals onto single granule cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Cerebellum", "Feedback, Sensory", "Motor Activity", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961263092", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7404713877": {"Name": "Ishikawa T.", "AuthorID": "7404713877", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "7801557085": {"Name": "Shimuta M.", "AuthorID": "7801557085", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "7003425281": {"Name": "H\u00e4user M.", "AuthorID": "7003425281", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
