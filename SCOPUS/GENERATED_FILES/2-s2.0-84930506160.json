Solution based block copolymer self-assembly routes to achieve ordered mesoporous and crystalline titania have been studied for more than a decade, but have so far mostly been limited to water and alcohol dispersible polymers. This constraint has limited the accessible morphology space as well as structural dimensions. Moreover, synthetic approaches are mostly performed in a trial-and-error fashion using chemical intuition rather than being based on well-defined design parameters. We present solubility design guidelines that facilitate coassembly with highly amphiphilic block copolymers, enabling the formation of ordered structures with diverse length scales (d<inf>10</inf> = 13.8-63.0 nm) and bulk-type morphologies. Thus, highly ordered and crystalline titania with the largest reported pores (d = 32.3 nm) was demonstrated for such a coassembly approach without the use of pore-expanders. Furthermore, the use of an ABC triblock terpolymer system led to a 3D ordered network morphology. In all cases, subsequent calcination treatments, such as the CASH procedure, enabled the formation of highly crystalline mesoporous materials while preserving the mesostructure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amphiphilic block copolymers", "Block copolymer self-assembly", "Calcination treatment", "Crystalline mesoporous", "Crystalline titania", "Crystalline transition", "Energy conversion and storages", "Structural dimensions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930506160", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"26533431100": {"Name": "Stefik M.", "AuthorID": "26533431100", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina"}, "55261044300": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "55261044300", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University"}, "26768199000": {"Name": "Sai H.", "AuthorID": "26768199000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Center for Bio-inspired Energy Science, Northwestern University"}, "56670375700": {"Name": "Boldrighini P.", "AuthorID": "56670375700", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University"}, "14523235000": {"Name": "Orilall M.", "AuthorID": "14523235000", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University"}, "7006467467": {"Name": "Wiesner U.", "AuthorID": "7006467467", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "22964377100": {"Name": "Steiner U.", "AuthorID": "22964377100", "AffiliationID": "60106421", "AffiliationName": "Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg Chemin des Verdiers"}, "7102958350": {"Name": "Gruner S.", "AuthorID": "7102958350", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cornell University and Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source"}}}
