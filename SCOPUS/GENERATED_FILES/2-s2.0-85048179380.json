Myofibroblasts are pivotal in the pathogenesis of PD. Adenosine and adenosine receptors have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of fibrosis. Aim: To understand the role of adenosine receptors in myofibroblast transformation in PD. Methods: Fibroblasts were isolated from the non-PD tunica albuginea (TA) tissue and PD plaque tissue and were transformed into myofibroblasts using transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21. Quantification of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and adenosine receptors (adenosine receptor A1 [ADORA1], adenosine receptor A2A, adenosine receptor A2B [ADORA2B], and adenosine receptor A3) was performed using immuno-cytochemistry, in-cell enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ICE), and real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effect of various adenosine receptor agonists or antagonists on TGF-\u03b21-induced myofibroblast transformation was measured using ICE. Outcomes: Expression of adenosine receptors in myofibroblasts obtained from human TA and the effect of adenosine receptor ligands on myofibroblast transformation were investigated. Results: The experiments showed that the protein and messenger RNA levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in non-PD TA cells and PD plaque-derived cells were significantly higher in cells exposed to TGF-\u03b21 than those not treated with TGF-\u03b21. 2 of 4 adenosine receptors (ADORA1 and ADORA2B) were found to be expressed in both cell populations. Among various adenosine receptor agonists/antagonist investigated, only ADORA2B agonist, BAY 60-6583, significantly inhibited myofibroblast transformation in a concentration-dependent manner when applied simultaneously with TGF-\u03b21 (IC50 = 30 \u03bcmol/L). Clinical Translation: ADORA2B agonists may be clinically efficacious in early-stage PD. Strengths & Limitations: The strength of this study is the use of primary fibroblasts from human TA. Limitation of the study is the high concentrations of the ligands used. Conclusion: The effect of an ADORA2B agonist on TGF-\u03b21-induced myofibroblast transformation shows a novel potential therapeutic target for PD if applied during early, non-stable phase of PD.
