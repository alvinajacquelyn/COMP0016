To support the shift toward value-based health care in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) assembled an international working group of health professionals and patient representatives to develop a standardized minimum set of patient-centered outcomes targeted for clinical use. The considered outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures were generated from systematic literature reviews. Feedback was sought from patients and health professionals. Patients with very high-risk CKD (stages G3a/A3 and G3b/A2-G5, including dialysis, kidney transplantation, and conservative care) were selected as the target population. Using an online modified Delphi process, outcomes important to all patients were selected, such as survival and hospitalization, and to treatment-specific subgroups, such as vascular access survival and kidney allograft survival. Patient-reported outcome measures were included to capture domains of health-related quality of life, which were rated as the most important outcomes by patients. Demographic and clinical variables were identified to be used as case-mix adjusters. Use of these consensus recommendations could enable institutions to monitor, compare, and improve the quality of their CKD care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["case-mix adjustment", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD)", "dialysis", "health-related quality of life (HRQoL)", "kidney transplantation", "modified Delphi technique", "outcome assessment", "patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)", "patient-centered outcomes", "quality of health care", "routine clinical practice", "shared decision making", "value-based health care (VBHC)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058624982", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57193200564": {"Name": "Verberne W.R.", "AuthorID": "57193200564", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "St Antonius Hospital"}, "7004685955": {"Name": "Bos W.J.W.", "AuthorID": "7004685955", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57201590443": {"Name": "Das-Gupta Z.", "AuthorID": "57201590443", "AffiliationID": "119550743", "AffiliationName": "International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement"}, "57194055871": {"Name": "Roberts C.", "AuthorID": "57194055871", "AffiliationID": "119550743", "AffiliationName": "International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement"}, "57205117894": {"Name": "Salt M.J.", "AuthorID": "57205117894", "AffiliationID": "119550743", "AffiliationName": "International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement"}, "37036895300": {"Name": "Allegretti A.S.", "AuthorID": "37036895300", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "57197352228": {"Name": "Bart H.A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197352228", "AffiliationID": "112986277", "AffiliationName": "patient representative, Dutch Kidney Patients Association (NVN)"}, "7003620625": {"Name": "van Biesen W.", "AuthorID": "7003620625", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Renal Division, Ghent University Hospital"}, "57204716567": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda G.", "AuthorID": "57204716567", "AffiliationID": "60008943, 60032700", "AffiliationName": "University of Guadalajara Health Sciences Center, Hospital Civil de Guadalajara \u201cFray Antonio Alcalde,\u201d"}, "36788975400": {"Name": "Gibbons E.", "AuthorID": "36788975400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "35277758100": {"Name": "Parra E.", "AuthorID": "35277758100", "AffiliationID": "60022336", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet"}, "6507644797": {"Name": "Hemmelder M.H.", "AuthorID": "6507644797", "AffiliationID": "60070191", "AffiliationName": "Medical Center Leeuwarden"}, "55382765700": {"Name": "Jager K.J.", "AuthorID": "55382765700", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "ERA-EDTA Registry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "55402602400": {"Name": "Ketteler M.", "AuthorID": "55402602400", "AffiliationID": "60087206", "AffiliationName": "University of Split School of Medicine"}, "6507763343": {"Name": "Al Rohani M.", "AuthorID": "6507763343", "AffiliationID": "100732157", "AffiliationName": "Dibba Hospital"}, "15752090100": {"Name": "Stopper A.", "AuthorID": "15752090100", "AffiliationID": "121831414", "AffiliationName": "European Renal Care Providers Association"}, "6602447195": {"Name": "Terkivatan T.", "AuthorID": "6602447195", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "7004370861": {"Name": "Tuttle K.R.", "AuthorID": "7004370861", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Providence Medical Research Center, Providence Health Care Kidney Research Institute, Nephrology Division and Institute for Translational Health Sciences, University of Washington"}, "57202512739": {"Name": "Yang C.W.", "AuthorID": "57202512739", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Chang Gung University, College of Medicine"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}}}
