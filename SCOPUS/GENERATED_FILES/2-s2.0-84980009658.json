However, there is a paucity of guidance for best practice in conducting such analyses. For the results of a study to be valid and replicable, multiple biases must be addressed in the course of data preparation and analysis. In addition, standardizing methods across small, independent studies would increase comparability and the potential for effective meta-analysis. This article provides a discussion of important aspects of quality control, imputation and analysis of genome-wide data from a lowcoverage microarray, as well as a straight-forward guide to performing a genome-wide association study.
