The pathogenesis of mtDNA mutations is not fully understood although it is assumed that their final common pathway involves impaired oxidative phosphorylation. The identification of a specific respiratory chain defect (complex I deficiency) in Parkinson's disease (PD) 10 years ago focused attention on the aetiological and pathogenetic roles that mitochondria may play in neurodegenerative diseases. There is evidence now emerging that mtDNA abnormalities may determine the complex I defect in a proportion of PD patients and it may prove possible to use biochemical analysis of platelet and cybrid complex I function to identify those that lie within this group. Respiratory chain defects of a different pattern have been identified in Huntington's disease (HD) (complex II/III deficiency) and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) complex I-III deficiency). In both these disorders, the mitochondrial abnormality is secondary to the primary nuclear mutation:CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene in HD, and GAA repeat in the frataxin gene in FA. Nevertheless, it appears that the mitochondrion may be the target of the biochemical defects that are the consequence of these mutations. There is a close and reciprocal relationship between respiratory chain dysfunction and free radical generation, and there is evidence for oxidative stress and damage in PD, HD and FA, which together with the mitochondrial defect may result in cell damage. Impaired oxidative phosphorylation and free radical generation may independently adversely affect the maintenance of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)). A fall in \u0394\u03c8(m) is an early event (preceding nuclear fragmentation) in the apoptotic pathway. It is possible therefore that mitochondrial dysfunction in the neurodegenerative disorders may result in a fall in the apoptotic threshold of neurones which, in some, may be sufficient to induce cell death whilst, in others, additional factors may be required. In any event, mitochondria present an important target for future strategies for 'neuroprotection' to prevent or retard neurodegeneration.
