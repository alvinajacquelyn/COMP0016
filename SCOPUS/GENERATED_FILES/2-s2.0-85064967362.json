Additionally, it has been shown that luminescence quenching occurs in the Pb-based analogues, (AEQT)PbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I), however, energy transfer and charge separation between organic and inorganic components of the structures are still not fully understood. Herein, we investigate the geometrical, electronic and optical properties of the semiconducting 2D perovskites (AEQT)BX4 (B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I), using relativistic hybrid density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate that unlike the traditional 2D perovskites, the choice of the organic ammonium cation has a considerable effect on the carrier transport properties. Our calculations reveal that optical transitions between the organic and inorganic components is disallowed. The electronic structures of the series are flexibly tailored by different halides and metal cations, with band gaps ranging from 2.06 to 2.68 eV. Energy level alignments greatly hinder the electron-hole recombination in (AEQT)PbCl4, (AEQT)PbBr4, (AEQT)PbI4 and (AEQT)SnBr4, and thereby should enhance their PL efficiencies. With a moderate fundamental band gap (2.06 eV) and strong direct valence band to conduction band transition, (AEQT)SnI4 is the only composition that shows intense and broad optical absorption, and as expected displays a high spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of 20.8%. Our results indicate the (AEQT)SnI4 is a stable and efficient light-absorbing material for application as a top absorber of the tandem solar cell.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkylammonium cations", "Electron-hole recombination", "Electronic and optical properties", "Energy level alignment", "Hybrid density functional theory", "Luminescence quenching", "Organic ammonium cations", "Two Dimensional (2 D)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064967362", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57205187795": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57205187795", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "56405111800": {"Name": "Niu C.", "AuthorID": "56405111800", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "Xi'An Jiaotong University, Center of Nanomaterials for Renewable Energy, State Key Lab of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering"}, "56872913700": {"Name": "Ganose A.M.", "AuthorID": "56872913700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
