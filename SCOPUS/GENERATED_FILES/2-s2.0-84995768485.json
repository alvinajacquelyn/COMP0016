Despite intensive research concerning the underlying disease mechanisms, the involvement of the CD200/CD200R axis in supporting or preventing the onset of COPD has not yet been addressed. Since the CD200/CD200R axis is crucially implicated in the maintenance of pulmonary immune homeostasis, we hypothesized that it might be involved in controlling the onset of COPD. Methods: To address this, we analyzed the serum samples from COPD patients and normal controls for soluble (s) CD200 and correlated the data to COPD-relevant clinical parameters. In addition, basic studies were conducted in CD200-deficient and wild-type mice in which COPD-like inflammation was induced with elastase/LPS followed by lung and serum component analysis. Results: We observed a positive correlation between serum sCD200 and IL-6 levels as well as a trend toward a negative correlation of sCD200 with vitamin D3 in COPD patients. Further investigations in mice revealed that despite elevated serum concentration of MMP-9 in CD200KO mice, the early onset of COPD-like lung inflammation was similar in CD200-deficient and wild-type animals in terms of immune cell infiltration, emphysematous changes, and mucus overproduction. Conclusions: While our murine studies suggest that the co-inhibitory molecule CD200 does not appear to play a prominent role in the early onset of COPD-like features, correlation of sCD200 serum levels with COPD-related parameters in humans with established disease revealed that the CD200/CD200R axis may be mechanistically linked to the disease course in COPD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD200-deficient mice", "CD200/CD200R axis", "COPD", "LPS/elastase model", "MMP-9"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Antigens, Surface", "Case-Control Studies", "Cholecalciferol", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Lymphocytes", "Macrophages, Alveolar", "Male", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Middle Aged", "Neutrophils", "Pancreatic Elastase", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Receptors, Cell Surface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995768485", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"23111874700": {"Name": "Sakthivel P.", "AuthorID": "23111874700", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Infection Immunology Group, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Infection Control and Prevention, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "6507010133": {"Name": "Gereke M.", "AuthorID": "6507010133", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Infection Immunology Group, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Infection Control and Prevention, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "6602993118": {"Name": "Bruder D.", "AuthorID": "6602993118", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Infection Immunology Group, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Infection Control and Prevention, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "23487724900": {"Name": "Breithaupt A.", "AuthorID": "23487724900", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "22134122400": {"Name": "Gruber A.D.", "AuthorID": "22134122400", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "57197345814": {"Name": "Copland D.A.", "AuthorID": "57197345814", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172674, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172674, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57213664595": {"Name": "Schulz C.", "AuthorID": "57213664595", "AffiliationID": "60072303, 60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, University Hospital"}, "56208305300": {"Name": "Schreiber J.", "AuthorID": "56208305300", "AffiliationID": "60072303, 60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pulmonology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, University Hospital"}}}
