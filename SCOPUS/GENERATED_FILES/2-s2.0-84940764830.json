In all, 451 employees working in the medical sector completed a number of questionnaires including the Hogan Development Survey and well-established organisational measures. We found that Excitable, Sceptical and Bold dark-side traits were predictors for both positive and negative organisational attitudes, whereas Leisurely was a predictor for positive organisational attitudes and Cautious for negative. We also found that the higher order factor Moving Away from Others was the strongest predictor for both types of work attitudes whereas Moving Against and Moving Towards Others were positive predictors for positive organisational attitudes. Implications and limitations are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark side", "Negative work attitudes", "Positive work attitudes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940764830", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56568417900": {"Name": "Palaiou K.", "AuthorID": "56568417900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}, "57214343635": {"Name": "Zarola A.", "AuthorID": "57214343635", "AffiliationID": "101798405", "AffiliationName": "Zeal Solutions"}}}
