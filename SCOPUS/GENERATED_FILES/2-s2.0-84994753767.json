Methods: This prospective cohort study used data on 9193 individuals (4768 females, 4425 males) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Depressive symptoms during three age periods (10\u201312, 12\u201316, 16\u201320 years) were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and ICD-10 depression at age 18 was assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised. Results: Low SEP was associated with increased incidence rates of depressive symptoms in all age periods, with indicators of low standard of living showing the strongest associations. For instance, incidence rate ratios for material hardship were 1.75 (95% CI [1.42\u20132.15]) at 10\u201312 years, 1.36 (1.16\u20131.61) at 12\u201316 years and 1.39 (1.21\u20131.59) at 16\u201320 years. Low SEP was also associated with increased odds of ICD-10 depression at 18 years, ranging from OR = 1.20 (95% CI [0.94\u20131.52]) for manual social class to 1.74 (1.35\u20132.24) for material hardship. Conclusions: There was no evidence that depressive symptoms can be \u201csubtyped\u201d by the age of onset, because the association with low SEP was evident for early- and later-onset symptoms. If socioeconomic inequalities in early life have long-term adverse impacts on mental health, policies addressing these inequalities could benefit the mental health of the population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "Cohort study", "Depression", "Depressive symptoms", "Socioeconomic position"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "International Classification of Diseases", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Health", "Parents", "Prospective Studies", "Social Class", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994753767", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"15759465700": {"Name": "Joinson C.", "AuthorID": "15759465700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7801382253": {"Name": "Kounali D.", "AuthorID": "7801382253", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
