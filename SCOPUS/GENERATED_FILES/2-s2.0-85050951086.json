Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between maceration, PMI and body organ apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in a cohort of subjects across a wide gestational range. Materials: Whole body post-mortem MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences were performed at 1.5 T, with b values of 0, 500 and 1000 mm2/s. Mean ADC values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) placed in the lungs, myocardium, spleen, renal cortex, liver and psoas muscle by two independent readers. Multivariable regression analysis was performed against PMI, gestational age, post-mortem weight, maceration score and gender. Results: Eighty perinatal deaths were imaged with mean gestational age of 32 weeks (18\u201341 weeks), of which 49 (61.3%) were male. The mean PMI was 8 days (1\u201318 days). Maceration scores were statistically significant predictive factors for ADC values in all included body organs except the lungs, but PMI was not a predictor for ADC values in any body organ. In the absence of maceration (n = 14), PMI was not statistically associated with ADC values in any of the body areas. The ratio of agreement in the majority of body areas was close to 1 (range between 0.95 and 1.10). Conclusion: Maceration, not PMI, is significantly associated with ADC values in perinatal deaths. Further research is needed to understand organ-specific changes in the post-mortem period.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Diffusion", "MRI", "Paediatric", "Perinatal", "Post-mortem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abortion, Induced", "Abortion, Spontaneous", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Fetal Death", "Forensic Medicine", "Gestational Age", "Heart", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Kidney Cortex", "Liver", "Lung", "Male", "Postmortem Changes", "Pregnancy", "Psoas Muscles", "Spleen", "Stillbirth", "Whole Body Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050951086", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"55545709400": {"Name": "Shelmerdine S.C.", "AuthorID": "55545709400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "54978610800": {"Name": "Langan D.", "AuthorID": "54978610800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57213920823": {"Name": "Main C.", "AuthorID": "57213920823", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
