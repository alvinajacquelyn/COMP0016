This study explores whether EWSs anticipated human population collapse during the European Neolithic. It analyzes recent reconstructions of European Neolithic (8-4 kya) population trends that reveal regime shifts from a period of rapid growth following the introduction of agriculture to a period of instability and collapse. We find statistical support for EWSs in advance of population collapse. Seven of nine regional datasets exhibit increasing autocorrelation and variance leading up to collapse, suggesting that these societies began to recover from perturbation more slowly as resilience declined. We derive EWS statistics from a prehistoric population proxy based on summed archaeological radiocarbon date probability densities. We use simulation to validate our methods and show that sampling biases, atmospheric effects, radiocarbon calibration error, and taphonomic processes are unlikely to explain the observed EWS patterns. The implications of these results for understanding the dynamics of Neolithic ecosystems are discussed, and we present a general framework for analyzing societal regime shifts using EWS at large spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that our findings are consistent with an adaptive cycling model that highlights both the vulnerability and resilience of early European populations.We close by discussing the implications of the detection of EWS in human systems for archaeology and sustainability science.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeology", "Early warning signs", "Human paleodemography", "Neolithic Europe", "Resilience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Archaeology", "Computer Simulation", "Ecosystem", "Europe", "History, Ancient", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Population Dynamics", "Radiometric Dating"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984670416", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22979291300": {"Name": "Downey S.", "AuthorID": "22979291300", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Anthropology Department, University of Maryland"}, "54995533300": {"Name": "Haas W.", "AuthorID": "54995533300", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Anthropology Department, University of Maryland"}, "6602927062": {"Name": "Shennan S.", "AuthorID": "6602927062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
