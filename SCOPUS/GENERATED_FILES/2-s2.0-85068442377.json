Its large presynaptic bouton features multiple release sites and is densely packed with thousands of synaptic vesicles, to sustain a highly facilitating \u201cdetonator\u201d transmission. However, whether glutamate release sites at this synapse act independently, in a stochastic manner, or rather synchronously, remains poorly understood. This knowledge is critical for a better understanding of mechanisms underpinning presynaptic plasticity and postsynaptic signal integration rules. Here, we use the optical glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR and the intracellular Ca2+ indicator Cal-590 to monitor spike-evoked glutamate release and presynaptic calcium entry in MF boutons. Multiplexed imaging reveals that distinct sites in individual MF giant boutons release glutamate in a probabilistic fashion, also showing use-dependent short-term facilitation. The present approach provides novel insights into the basic mechanisms of neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action potential", "CA3 pyramidal cell", "Dentate gyrus", "Giant mossy fiber bouton", "Glutamate release", "Short-term plasticity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068442377", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7003901663": {"Name": "Rama S.", "AuthorID": "7003901663", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7401539602": {"Name": "Jensen T.", "AuthorID": "7401539602", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
