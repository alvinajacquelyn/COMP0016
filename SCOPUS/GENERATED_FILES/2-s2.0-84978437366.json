Currently, the full wave inversion (FWI) methods used for their reconstruction are very different: the AA is mainly estimated using frequency domain algorithms, while the SS is more often recovered in the time domain. In this work we present a novel strategy to recover the attenuation maps through a straightforward and simplified procedure in the time domain. A gradient descent method was employed to optimize iteratively the attenuation distribution. The expression for the functional gradient of the norm of the global deviation between experimental and simulated data was obtained using an adjoint method. The optimization code, implemented in C++, employs a CUDA version of the k-Wave software to perform forward and backward wave propagation. Noisy simulated data was used to test the performance of the proposed method. The simplicity of the formulation of this new method may facilitate the reconstruction of AA and SS maps under a common framework in USCT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adjoint method", "attenuation maps", "full-wave inversion", "gradient-descent", "USCT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjoint methods", "Attenuation maps", "Full waves", "Gradient descent", "USCT"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978437366", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56449437100": {"Name": "Perez-Liva M.", "AuthorID": "56449437100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "14522681300": {"Name": "Herraiz J.", "AuthorID": "14522681300", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de F\u00edsica Nuclear, Departamento de F\u00edsica At\u00f3mica, Molecular y Nuclear, CEI Moncloa, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "6701483306": {"Name": "Udias J.", "AuthorID": "6701483306", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de F\u00edsica Nuclear, Departamento de F\u00edsica At\u00f3mica, Molecular y Nuclear, CEI Moncloa, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
