Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Two-pore channels (TPCs) are endolysosomal ion channels implicated in Ca2+ signalling from acidic organelles. The relevance of these ubiquitous proteins for human disease, however, is unclear. Here, we report that lysosomes are enlarged and aggregated in fibroblasts from Parkinson disease patients with the common G2019S mutation in LRRK2. Defects were corrected by molecular silencing of TPC2, pharmacological inhibition of TPC regulators [Rab7, NAADP and PtdIns(3,5)P2] and buffering local Ca2+ increases. NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals were exaggerated in diseased cells. TPC2 is thus a potential drug target within a pathogenic LRRK2 cascade that disrupts Ca2+-dependent trafficking in Parkinson disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ca2+", "LRRK2", "Lysosomes", "NAADP", "Parkinson disease", "TPCN2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Fibroblasts", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Lysosomes", "NADP", "Parkinson Disease", "Primary Cell Culture", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921415558", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56487542500": {"Name": "Hockey L.", "AuthorID": "56487542500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55915788000": {"Name": "Kilpatrick B.", "AuthorID": "55915788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7004743246": {"Name": "Eden E.", "AuthorID": "7004743246", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8854249500": {"Name": "Futter C.", "AuthorID": "8854249500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "54909221200": {"Name": "Lin-Moshier Y.", "AuthorID": "54909221200", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota Medical School"}, "7103241145": {"Name": "Marchant J.", "AuthorID": "7103241145", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota Medical School"}, "14040168400": {"Name": "Cristina Brailoiu G.", "AuthorID": "14040168400", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Thomas Jefferson University, Jefferson School of Pharmacy"}, "6603936682": {"Name": "Brailoiu E.", "AuthorID": "6603936682", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Center for Substance Abuse Research, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "7102634392": {"Name": "Schapira A.", "AuthorID": "7102634392", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
