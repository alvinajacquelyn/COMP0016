However, HCC surveillance remains costly, cumbersome and suboptimal. We tested whether and how serum Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) should be used in HCC surveillance. Record linkage, dedicated pathways for management and AFP data-storage identified i) consecutive highly characterised cases of HCC diagnosed in 2009-14 and ii) a cohort of ongoing HCC-free patients undergoing regular HCC surveillance from 2009. These two well-defined Scottish patient cohorts enabled us to test the utility of AFP surveillance. Of 04 cases of HCC diagnosed over 6 years, 42% (129) were identified by a dedicated HCC surveillance programme. Of these 129, 47% (61) had a detectable lesion first identified by screening ultrasound (US) but 38% (49) were prompted by elevated AFP. Despite pre-HCC diagnosis AFP >20kU/L being associated with poor outcome, 'AFP-detected' tumours were offered potentially curative management as frequently as 'US-detected' HCCs; and had comparable survival. Linearity of serial log10 -transformed AFPs in HCC cases and in the screening 'HCC-free' cohort (n = 1509) provided indicators of high-risk AFP behaviour in HCC cases. An algorithm was devised in static mode, then tested dynamically. A case/control series in hepatitis C related disease demonstrated highly significant detection (p<1.72\u221710-5) of patients at high risk of developing HCC. These data support the use of AFP in HCC surveillance. We show proof-of-principle that an automated and further refineable algorithmic interpretation of AFP can identify patients at higher risk of HCC. This approach could provide a cost-effective, user-friendly and much needed addition to US surveillance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "alpha-Fetoproteins", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Public Health Surveillance", "Survival Analysis", "Ultrasonography", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976382157", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7202832908": {"Name": "Bird T.G.", "AuthorID": "7202832908", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research, UK Beatson Institute"}, "57190005868": {"Name": "Cusack P.", "AuthorID": "57190005868", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver and Digestive Disorders, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "57217741208": {"Name": "Hey S.", "AuthorID": "57217741208", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver and Digestive Disorders, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "57190003131": {"Name": "Blunsum A.", "AuthorID": "57190003131", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver and Digestive Disorders, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "57190006127": {"Name": "Kelly S.", "AuthorID": "57190006127", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver and Digestive Disorders, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "56466800400": {"Name": "Hayes P.C.", "AuthorID": "56466800400", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver and Digestive Disorders, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "57194854144": {"Name": "Dimitropoulou P.", "AuthorID": "57194854144", "AffiliationID": "60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit"}, "7404556631": {"Name": "Turner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7404556631", "AffiliationID": "60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit"}, "7201459524": {"Name": "Bird S.M.", "AuthorID": "7201459524", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Strathclyde University"}, "55252732900": {"Name": "Jenks S.J.", "AuthorID": "55252732900", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "7004109919": {"Name": "Sturgeon C.", "AuthorID": "7004109919", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}}}
