Conjugative plasmids are transferred from one bacterium to another through a type IV secretion system (T4SS) in the form of single-stranded DNA covalently attached to a protein called relaxase. The relaxase is fully functional both in a donor cell (prior to conjugation) and recipient cell (after conjugation). Here, we demonstrate that the protein substrate has to unfold for efficient translocation through the conjugative T4SS. Furthermore, we present various relaxase modifications that preserve the function of the relaxase but block substrate translocation. This study brings us a step closer to deciphering the complete mechanism of T4SS substrate translocation, which is vital for the development of new therapies against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conjugation", "Secretion systems", "T4SS", "Transport", "Type 4 secretion systems", "Unfolding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Conjugation, Genetic", "Escherichia coli", "Plasmids", "Protein Unfolding", "Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase", "Type IV Secretion Systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042402444", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55350076200": {"Name": "Trokter M.", "AuthorID": "55350076200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences"}, "7004804200": {"Name": "Waksman G.", "AuthorID": "7004804200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences"}}}
