Their optical, electrochemical and morphological properties have been evaluated and compared to those of the non-rotaxane counterpart 3. The influence of TM-\u03b2CD or TM-\u03b3CD encapsulation on the thermal stability, solubility in common organic solvents, film forming ability was also investigated. Polyrotaxane 3 TM-\u03b2CD exhibits a hypsochromic shift, while 3 TM-\u03b3CD displays a bathochromic with respect to the non-rotaxane 3 counterpart. For the diluted CHCl3 solutions the fluorescence lifetimes of all compounds follow a mono-exponential decay with a time constant of \u2248\u22480.6 ns. At higher concentration the fluorescence decay remains mono-exponential for 3 TM-\u03b2CD and polymers 3, with a lifetime \u03c4 = 0.7 ns and 0.8 ns, whereas the 3 TM-\u03b3CD polyrotaxane shows a bi-exponential decay consisting of a main component (with a weight of 98% of the total luminescence) with a relatively short decay constant of \u03c41 = 0.7 ns and a minor component with a longer lifetime of \u03c42 = 5.4 ns (2%). The electrochemical band gap (\u0394Eg of 3 TM-\u03b2CD polyrotaxane is smaller than that of 3 TM-\u03b3CD and 3, respectively. The lower \u0394Eg value for 3 TM-\u03b2CD suggests that the encapsulation has a greater effect on the reduction process, which affects the LUMO energy level value. Based on AFM analysis, 3 TM-\u03b2CD and 3 TM-\u03b3CD polyrotaxane compounds exhibit a granular morphology with lower dispersity and smaller roughness exponent of the film surfaces in comparison with those of the neat copolymer 3.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy band gaps", "Fluorescence lifetimes", "Permethylated cyclodextrins", "Polyfluorene", "Polyrotaxanes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961839089", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"6602083284": {"Name": "Farcas A.", "AuthorID": "6602083284", "AffiliationID": "60022305", "AffiliationName": "Supramolecular Chemistry Group, Petru Poni Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Grigore Ghica Voda Alley"}, "22938661600": {"Name": "Resmerita A.M.", "AuthorID": "22938661600", "AffiliationID": "60022305", "AffiliationName": "Supramolecular Chemistry Group, Petru Poni Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Grigore Ghica Voda Alley"}, "55562231300": {"Name": "Tregnago G.", "AuthorID": "55562231300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics, Astronomy University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics, Astronomy University College London"}, "7006385593": {"Name": "Aubert P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006385593", "AffiliationID": "60134789, 60002272", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physicochimie des Polym\u00e8res et des Interfaces (EA 2528), Institut des Mat\u00e9riaux, Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise"}}}
