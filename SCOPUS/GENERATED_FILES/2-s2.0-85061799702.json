Recent development of this tool has allowed the performance of a transperineal prostate biopsy allowing pre-programmed standardized biopsy schemes. Prospective data collection was undertaken in 86 consecutive men who underwent robotically assisted transperineal prostate biopsy. All underwent a multi-parametric MRI pre-biopsy with centroid targeting followed by systematic template prostate biopsy. For the purposes of this study, our definition of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is any Gleason score > 6. Mean (SD) age, median (IQR) PSA, and median (IQR) prostate volume were 64.24 (6.97) years, of 7.79 ng/ml (6.5) and 45.06 cc (28), respectively. Overall, 44 (51.2%) men were diagnosed with csPCa. csPCa was detected in the targeted biopsies alone in 35 (40.1%) men. The addition of the 12-zone template biopsy increased the yield of csPCa for another 9 (10.5%) men. Of these 9 men, the majority (7) harbored primary pattern 3 disease and only 1 was identified to have high-grade disease. Out of these 9 men, 7 of them had the identification of csPCa in the sector, where a target was contained within that zone. Robotic-assisted prostate biopsy in our study has demonstrated a high detection of csPCa when combined with limited near-field sampling. Our study suggests the use of more accurate biopsy schemes such as ring-targeting of lesions to mitigate against systematic and random mathematical errors. Adoption of this tool and biopsy strategy would potentially avoid the increased morbidity associated with whole gland systematic unguided biopsies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fusion biopsy", "Robotic prostate biopsy", "Targeted biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Prostate", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061799702", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"35203878900": {"Name": "Miah S.", "AuthorID": "35203878900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57194439445": {"Name": "Servian P.", "AuthorID": "57194439445", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7403524499": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "7403524499", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "56650888000": {"Name": "Lovegrove C.", "AuthorID": "56650888000", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57206666098": {"Name": "Skelton L.", "AuthorID": "57206666098", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57114379700": {"Name": "Shah T.T.", "AuthorID": "57114379700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7201542866": {"Name": "Winkler M.", "AuthorID": "7201542866", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "35273779600": {"Name": "Tam H.", "AuthorID": "35273779600", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55752715900": {"Name": "Eldred-Evans D.", "AuthorID": "55752715900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
