Strong inhibition (Haider et al., 2013) counterbalances excitation, enabling sensory features to be sharpened and represented by sparse codes (Willmore et al., 2011). This balance between excitation and inhibition makes it difficult to assess the strength, or gain, of recurrent excitatory connections within cortical networks, which is key to understanding their operational regime and the computations that they perform. Networks that combine an unstable high-gain excitatory population with stabilizing inhibitory feedback are known as inhibition-stabilized networks (ISNs) (Tsodyks et al., 1997). Theoretical studies using reduced network models predict that ISNs produce paradoxical responses to perturbation, but experimental perturbations failed to find evidence for ISNs in cortex (Atallah et al., 2012). Here, we reexamined this question by investigating how cortical network models consisting of many neurons behave after perturbations and found that results obtained from reduced network models fail to predict responses to perturbations in more realistic networks. Our models predict that a large proportion of the inhibitory network must be perturbed to reliably detect an ISN regime robustly in cortex. We propose that wide-field optogenetic suppression of inhibition under promoters targeting a large fraction of inhibitory neurons may provide a perturbation of sufficient strength to reveal the operating regime of cortex. Our results suggest that detailed computational models of optogenetic perturbations are necessary to interpret the results of experimental paradigms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational model", "Cortical computation", "Inhibitory stabilization", "Optogenetics", "Recurrent excitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Humans", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Neural Inhibition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037610418", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55928013100": {"Name": "Sadeh S.", "AuthorID": "55928013100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7201936933": {"Name": "Silver R.", "AuthorID": "7201936933", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57202973510": {"Name": "Mrsic-Flogel T.", "AuthorID": "57202973510", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "26654989100": {"Name": "Muir D.", "AuthorID": "26654989100", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}}}
