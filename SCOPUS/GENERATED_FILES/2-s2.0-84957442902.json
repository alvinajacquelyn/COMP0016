Although identification and treatment may be beneficial, no well-designed studies have investigated the prevalence of mental disorder and the potential benefits of individual manualized CBT in older victims of crime. Aims: To identify mental health problems in older victims of common crime, provide preliminary data on its prevalence, and conduct a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) using mixed methods. Method: Older victims, identified through police teams, were screened for symptoms of anxiety, depression or post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) one (n = 581) and 3 months (n = 486) after experiencing a crime. Screen positive participants were offered diagnostic interviews. Of these, 26 participants with DSM-IV diagnoses agreed to be randomized to Treatment As Usual (TAU) or TAU plus our manualized CBT informed Victim Improvement Package (VIP). The latter provided feedback on the VIP. Results: Recruitment, assessment and intervention are feasible and acceptable. At 3 months 120/486 screened as cases, 33 had DSM-IV criteria for a psychiatric disorder; 26 agreed to be randomized to a pilot trial. There were trends in favour of the VIP in all measures except PTSD at 6 months post crime. Conclusions: This feasibility RCT is the first step towards improving the lives of older victims of common crime. Without intervention, distress at 3 and 6 months after a crime remains high. However, the well-received VIP appeared promising for depressive and anxiety symptoms, but possibly not posttraumatic stress disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive behavioural therapy", "Crime", "older adults", "pilot randomized controlled trial", "psychological distress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognitive Therapy", "Crime", "Crime Victims", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957442902", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"57211248716": {"Name": "Serfaty M.", "AuthorID": "57211248716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "23474975000": {"Name": "Ridgewell A.", "AuthorID": "23474975000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200232705": {"Name": "Wright A.", "AuthorID": "57200232705", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102345842": {"Name": "Blanchard M.", "AuthorID": "7102345842", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603735057": {"Name": "Drennan V.", "AuthorID": "6603735057", "AffiliationID": "60033387, 60010426, 60033359", "AffiliationName": "St. George's Hospital, University of London and Kingston University"}, "7007085407": {"Name": "Kessel A.", "AuthorID": "7007085407", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England"}, "6701795133": {"Name": "Laycock G.", "AuthorID": "6701795133", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
