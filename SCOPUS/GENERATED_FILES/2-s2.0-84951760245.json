Pressure-temperature (PT) reconstructions using monomineral thermobarometry for 5 phases show division of the SCLM beneath the Kharamai field into 6 units: pyroxenitic Fe-rich (1-2 GPa) and Mg-rich (2-3 GPa) layers; middle with two levels of Gar-Sp pyroxenites at \u223c3 and 4-5 GPa; Gar-dunite-harzburgites \u223c4.5-6.5 GPa subjected to Ilm-Px vein metasomatism; and a Mg-rich dunite lower part. In the Anabar shield (Ary-Mastakh, Dyuken and Kuranakh fields) mantle lithosphere is composed of three large units divided into two parts: upper part with amphiboles and phlogopite; two levels of pyroxenites and eclogites at 3 and 4 GPa, and a lower part composed of refertilized dunites. Diagrams showing P-Fe#Gar clusters for garnets and omphacites illustrate the differences between SCLM of these localities. Differences of Triassic SCLM from Devonian SCLM are in simple layering; abundance of Na-Cr-amphiboles and metasomatism in the upper SCLM part, thick pyroxenite-eclogite layer and lower part depletion, heated from SCLM base to 5.0 GPa. Kharamai mantle clinopyroxenes represent three geochemical types: (1) harzburgitic with inclined linear REE, HFSE troughs and elevated Th, U; (2) lherzolitic or pyroxenitic with round TRE patterns and decreasing incompatible elements; (3) eclogitic with Eu troughs, Pb peak and high LILE content. Calculated parental melts for garnets with humped REE patterns suggest dissolution of former Cpx and depression means Cpx and garnets extraction. Clinopyroxenes from Ary-Mastakh fields show less inclined REE patterns with HMREE troughs and an increase of incompatible elements. Clinopyroxenes from Kuranakh field show flatter spoon-like REE patterns and peaks in Ba, U, Pb and Sr, similar to those in ophiolitic harzburgites. The PT diagrams for the mantle sections show high temperature gradients in the uppermost SCLM accompanied by an increase of P-Fe#Ol upward and slightly reduced thickness of the mantle keel of the Siberian craton, resulting from the influence of the Permian-Triassic superplume, but with no signs of delamination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Layering", "Mantle lithosphere", "Mineral geochemistry", "Monomineral thermobarometry", "Triassic kimberlite"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951760245", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"6603845588": {"Name": "Ashchepkov I.", "AuthorID": "6603845588", "AffiliationID": "60073372", "AffiliationName": "United Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SD RASc"}, "23469748900": {"Name": "Kuligin S.", "AuthorID": "23469748900", "AffiliationID": "60073372", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SD RAS, Novosibirsk"}, "54882076700": {"Name": "Vavilov M.", "AuthorID": "54882076700", "AffiliationID": "60073372", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SD RAS, Novosibirsk"}, "6506976532": {"Name": "Nigmatulina E.", "AuthorID": "6506976532", "AffiliationID": "60073372", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SD RAS, Novosibirsk"}, "23478681200": {"Name": "Tychkov N.", "AuthorID": "23478681200", "AffiliationID": "60073372", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SD RAS, Novosibirsk"}, "6506807785": {"Name": "Khmelnikova O.", "AuthorID": "6506807785", "AffiliationID": "60073372", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SD RAS, Novosibirsk"}, "6701542840": {"Name": "Vladykin N.", "AuthorID": "6701542840", "AffiliationID": "60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geochemistry SD RAS"}, "57207506826": {"Name": "Downes H.", "AuthorID": "57207506826", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "8730610300": {"Name": "Babushkina S.", "AuthorID": "8730610300", "AffiliationID": "60103853", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology of Diamonds and Noble Metals SD RAS"}}}
