Although there is increasing evidence that such mechanical signals are employed to control gene expression, it remains unclear how mechanical forces are transduced through the nucleus. To this end, we have measured the compliance of nuclei by applying oscillatory strains between 1 and 700 Hz to individual nuclei of multiple mammalian cell-lines that were compressed between two plates. The quantitative response varied with more than one order of magnitude and scaled with the size of the nucleus. Surprisingly, the qualitative behaviour was conserved among different cell-lines: all nuclei showed a softer and more viscous response towards the periphery, suggesting a reduced degree of crosslinking of the chromatin. This may be an important feature to regulate transcription via mechano-transduction in this most active and dynamic region of the nucleus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Nucleus", "Chromatin", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Mammals", "MCF-7 Cells", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Rheology", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027467675", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195361207": {"Name": "Lherbette M.", "AuthorID": "57195361207", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biological Chemistry, Biophysics and Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6507923017": {"Name": "Schaap I.", "AuthorID": "6507923017", "AffiliationID": "60120865", "AffiliationName": "SmarAct GmbH"}, "55832616500": {"Name": "Dos Santos \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "55832616500", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "55880946200": {"Name": "Hari-Gupta Y.", "AuthorID": "55880946200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "53863656500": {"Name": "Fili N.", "AuthorID": "53863656500", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "55337027300": {"Name": "Toseland C.", "AuthorID": "55337027300", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}}}
