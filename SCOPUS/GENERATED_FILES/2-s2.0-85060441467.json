Neurofilament (Nf) light (NfL) and heavy (NfH) chain levels as biomarkers for neuroaxonal injury were not evaluated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) before. We conducted a prospective, pilot observational study including 20 patients with septic shock and five patients without sepsis serving as controls. The assessment of SAE comprised a neuropsychiatric examination, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and delirium screening methods including the confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC). CSF Nf measurements in sepsis patients and longitudinal plasma Nf measurements in all participants were performed on days 1, 3 and 7 after study inclusion. Plasma NfL levels increased in sepsis patients over time (p = 0.0063) and remained stable in patients without sepsis. Plasma NfL values were significantly higher in patients with SAE (p = 0.011), significantly correlated with the severity of SAE represented by ICDSC values (R = 0.534, p = 0.022) and correlated with a poorer functional outcome after 100 days (R = -0.535, p = 0.0003). High levels of CSF Nf were measured in SAE patients. CSF NfL levels were higher in non-survivors (p = 0.012) compared with survivors and correlated with days until death (R = -0.932, p<0.0001) and functional outcome after 100 days (R = -0.749, p<0.0001). The present study showed for the first time that Nf levels provide complementary prognostic information in SAE patients indicating a higher chance of death and poorer functional/cognitive outcome in survivors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Diseases", "Critical Care", "Disease-Free Survival", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Intermediate Filaments", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index", "Shock, Septic", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060441467", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602965590": {"Name": "Ehler J.", "AuthorID": "6602965590", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimmunology, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35316309700": {"Name": "Richter G.", "AuthorID": "35316309700", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "6603884866": {"Name": "N\u00f6ldge-Schomburg G.", "AuthorID": "6603884866", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "57198055833": {"Name": "Sauer M.", "AuthorID": "57198055833", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimmunology, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603589179": {"Name": "Wittstock M.", "AuthorID": "6603589179", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "26428854500": {"Name": "Kolbaske S.", "AuthorID": "26428854500", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "23973158800": {"Name": "Gloger M.", "AuthorID": "23973158800", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Intensive Care Unit, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "23972883700": {"Name": "Henschel J.", "AuthorID": "23972883700", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Intensive Care Unit, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "26431605100": {"Name": "Rommer P.S.", "AuthorID": "26431605100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University Vienna"}, "7004510247": {"Name": "Grossmann A.", "AuthorID": "7004510247", "AffiliationID": "112658341", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Medical Center Rostock"}, "7004157942": {"Name": "Sharshar T.", "AuthorID": "7004157942", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Human Histopathology and Animal Models, Institut Pasteur"}}}
