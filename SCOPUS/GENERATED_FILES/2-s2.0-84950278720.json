Methods Teachers (n=555) in 8 schools completed self-report questionnaires. Levels of teacher wellbeing (Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale-WEMWBS) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-PHQ-9) were measured and associations between these measures and school-related factors were examined using multilevel multivariable regression models. Results The mean (SD) teacher wellbeing score (47.2 (8.8)) was lower than reported in working population samples, and 19.4% had evidence of moderate to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores >10). Feeling unable to talk to a colleague when feeling stressed or down, dissatisfaction with work and high presenteeism were all strongly associated with both poor wellbeing (beta coefficients ranged from -4.65 [-6.04, -3.28] to -3.39 [-5.48, -1.31]) and depressive symptoms (ORs ranged from 2.44 [1.41, 4.19] to 3.31 [1.70, 6.45]). Stress at work and recent change in school governance were also associated with poor wellbeing (beta coefficients=-4.22 [-5.95, -2.48] and -2.17 [-3.58, -0.77] respectively), while sickness absence and low student attendance were associated with depressive symptoms (ORs=2.14 [1.24, 3.67] and 1.93 [1.06, 6.45] respectively). Limitations i) This was a cross-sectional study; causal associations cannot be identified ii) several of the measures were self-report iii) the small number of schools reduced study power for the school-level variables Conclusions Wellbeing is low and depressive symptoms high amongst teachers. Interventions aimed at improving their mental health might focus on reducing work related stress, and increasing the support available to them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "Mental health", "School", "Teachers", "Wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Faculty", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Occupational Diseases", "Occupational Health", "Risk Factors", "Schools", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Workplace"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950278720", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8841757200": {"Name": "Kidger J.", "AuthorID": "8841757200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "26025876000": {"Name": "Brockman R.", "AuthorID": "26025876000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7004134399": {"Name": "Tilling K.", "AuthorID": "7004134399", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "55819464700": {"Name": "Campbell R.", "AuthorID": "55819464700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7006194937": {"Name": "Gunnell D.", "AuthorID": "7006194937", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7202760757": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "7202760757", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "7005637867": {"Name": "Araya R.", "AuthorID": "7005637867", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
