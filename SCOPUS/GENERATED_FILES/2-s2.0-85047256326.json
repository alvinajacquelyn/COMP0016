If extended families shape the objectives and constraints of households, then neglecting the role of this network may lead to an incomplete understanding of health-seeking behaviour. Understanding the decision-making processes behind care-seeking may improve behaviour change interventions, better intervention targeting and support health-related development goals. This paper uses data from a cluster randomised trial of a participatory learning and action cycle (PLA) through women's groups, to assess the role of extended family networks as a determinant of gains in health knowledge and health practice. We estimate three models along a continuum of health-seeking behaviour: one that explores access to PLA groups as a conduit of knowledge, another measuring whether women's health knowledge improves after exposure to the PLA groups and a third exploring the determinants of their ability to act on knowledge gained. We find that, in this context, a larger network of family is not associated with women's likelihood of attending groups or acquiring new knowledge, but a larger network of husband's family is negatively associated with the ability to act on that knowledge during pregnancy and the postpartum period.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Decision Making", "Family", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Nepal", "Population Surveillance", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047256326", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"26654536200": {"Name": "Skordis J.", "AuthorID": "26654536200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Economics, University College London"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Economics, University College London"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Economics, University College London"}, "24177083100": {"Name": "Pace N.", "AuthorID": "24177083100", "AffiliationID": "60013494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University Ca' Foscari of Venice"}, "6506111859": {"Name": "Vera-Hernandez M.", "AuthorID": "6506111859", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "12796887500": {"Name": "Rasul I.", "AuthorID": "12796887500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "22940991500": {"Name": "Fitzsimons E.", "AuthorID": "22940991500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "12767143700": {"Name": "Manandhar D.", "AuthorID": "12767143700", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Maternal and Infant Research Activity (MIRA)"}}}
