In this study, AmB complexes based on poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (PGGA) were prepared and evaluated for their efficacies against AmB-deoxycholate (Fungizone\u00ae) and liposomal AmB (AmBisome\u00ae). Physical characterizations showed that AmB/PGGA complexes are nanoscopic (20-40 nm) with a negative zeta potential (\u221245.5 to \u221251.0 mV), water-soluble, stable in solution (up to 4 weeks, at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C), and have a high drug loading (up to 35% w/w). In vitro, AmB/PGGA complexes exhibited a more favorable cytotoxicity profile than Fungizone\u00ae but comparable to AmBisome\u00ae, with respect to the hemolytic activity and the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u00df). In-vivo, AmB/PGGA complexes were significantly more efficacious than both Fungizone\u00ae and AmBisome\u00ae against experimental murine candidiasis. These results provide strong evidence that AmB/PGGA complexes display better efficacy and safety features than the currently approved AmB products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AmB/PGGA complexes", "Amphotericin B", "Fungizone\u00ae and AmBisome\u00ae", "Poly(gamma-glutamic acid)", "Toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["AmB/PGGA complexes", "AmBisome", "Amphotericin B", "Glutamic acid", "Hemolytic activity", "Negative zeta potentials", "Physical characterization", "Pro-inflammatory cytokines", "Amphotericin B", "Animals", "Antifungal Agents", "Candidiasis", "Glutamic Acid", "Mice", "Nanotechnology", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019768325", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57194336008": {"Name": "Dinh T.", "AuthorID": "57194336008", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56161735300": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "56161735300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "15756668000": {"Name": "Zia Q.", "AuthorID": "15756668000", "AffiliationID": "60032269", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Biotechnology Unit, Aligarh Muslim University"}, "36672410800": {"Name": "Zubair S.", "AuthorID": "36672410800", "AffiliationID": "60032269", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Biotechnology Unit, Aligarh Muslim University"}, "35583436400": {"Name": "Owais M.", "AuthorID": "35583436400", "AffiliationID": "60032269", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Biotechnology Unit, Aligarh Muslim University"}}}
