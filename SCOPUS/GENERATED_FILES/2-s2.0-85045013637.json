We aimed to assess hospital dementia diagnosis accuracy, changes over time, and predictors of correct identification. Method: Retrospective cohort study of people over 65 years, using data from a large mental health care database as gold standard, linked to 2008\u20132016 English hospital data. Results: In 21,387 people who had 138,455 admissions, we found sensitivity and specificity of dementia recording, respectively, to be 78.0% and 92.0% for each person's complete records, and 63.3% and 96.6% for each nonelective admission. Diagnostic sensitivity increased between 2008 and 16. Accurate general hospital recording of the presence of dementia was lower in ethnic minority groups, younger, single people, and those with physical illness. Discussion: Dementia diagnosis recording in general hospitals is increasing but remains less likely in some groups. Clinicians should be aware of this inequity and have a higher index of clinical suspicion in these groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis", "Epidemiology", "Hospital records", "Medical records", "Prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "England", "Female", "Hospitals, General", "Humans", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045013637", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56107100900": {"Name": "Sommerlad A.", "AuthorID": "56107100900", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006347341": {"Name": "Livingston G.", "AuthorID": "7006347341", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "34870305100": {"Name": "Perera G.", "AuthorID": "34870305100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35594617600": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "35594617600", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
