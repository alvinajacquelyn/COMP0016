This new study compares the results of microscopic analysis of the life-sized clay statues to other ceramic artefacts recovered from the mausoleum. By focusing on their original raw materials and clay paste recipes, it proves that the terracotta warriors were made near the site. Compositional, technological and spatial links between different artefacts suggest that clay was processed centrally before being distributed to different local workshops in a highly organised system of labour and craft specialisation that laid the foundation for imperial China.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "clay", "petrography", "Qin Shihuang", "Terracotta Army"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027014376", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"22953938100": {"Name": "Quinn P.", "AuthorID": "22953938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London, 31-34 Gordon Square, London WC1H 0PY"}, "57195318216": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57195318216", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "School of Humanities, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36774063200": {"Name": "Xia Y.", "AuthorID": "36774063200", "AffiliationID": "114100535", "AffiliationName": "Emperor Qin Shihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum, Lintong, xi'An"}, "56206611800": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56206611800", "AffiliationID": "114100535", "AffiliationName": "Emperor Qin Shihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum, Lintong, xi'An"}}}
