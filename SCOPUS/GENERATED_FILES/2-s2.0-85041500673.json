Methods: A nationally representative sample from Israel (n = 1,003) using a disorder-specific measure (ITQ; International Trauma Questionnaire) in order to assess PTSD and CPTSD along with the Life Events Checklist and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index. Results: Estimated prevalence rates of PTSD and CPTSD were 9.0 and 2.6%, respectively. The structural analyses indicated that PTSD and disturbances in self-organization symptom clusters were multidimensional, but not necessarily hierarchical, in nature and there were distinct classes that were consistent with PTSD and CPTSD. Conclusions: These results partially support the factorial validity and strongly support the discriminant validity of the ICD-11 proposals for PTSD and CPTSD in a nationally representative sample using a disorder-specific measure; findings also supported the international applicability of these diagnoses. Further research is required to determine the prevalence rates of PTSD and CPTSD in national representative samples across different countries and explore the predictive utility of different types of traumatic life events on PTSD and CPTSD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CFA", "CPTSD", "ICD-11", "PTSD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "International Classification of Diseases", "Israel", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Reproducibility of Results", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041500673", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6603955727": {"Name": "Ben-Ezra M.", "AuthorID": "6603955727", "AffiliationID": "60080064", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Work, Ariel University"}, "16425957200": {"Name": "Karatzias T.", "AuthorID": "16425957200", "AffiliationID": "60004120", "AffiliationName": "Rivers Centre for Traumatic Stress, NHS Lothian"}, "55113504900": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "55113504900", "AffiliationID": "60104048", "AffiliationName": "School of Business, National College of Ireland"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Educational & Health Psychology, University College London"}, "35420810100": {"Name": "Cloitre M.", "AuthorID": "35420810100", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, New York University"}, "24780669300": {"Name": "Bisson J.I.", "AuthorID": "24780669300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "15849417400": {"Name": "Roberts N.P.", "AuthorID": "15849417400", "AffiliationID": "60138351", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Counselling Directorate, Cardiff & Vale University Health Board"}, "24401605800": {"Name": "Lueger-Schuster B.", "AuthorID": "24401605800", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna"}, "7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Psychology Research Institute, Ulster University, Magee Campus"}}}
