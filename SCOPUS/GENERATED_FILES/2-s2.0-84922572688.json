Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.Background: Exome or whole-genome deep sequencing of tumor DNA along with paired normal DNA can potentially provide a detailed picture of the somatic mutations that characterize the tumor. However, analysis of such sequence data can be complicated by the presence of normal cells in the tumor specimen, by intratumor heterogeneity, and by the sheer size of the raw data. In particular, determination of copy number variations from exome sequencing data alone has proven difficult; thus, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have often been used for this task. Recently, algorithms to estimate absolute, but not allele-specific, copy number profiles fromtumor sequencing data have been described. Materials and methods: We developed Sequenza, a software package that uses paired tumor-normal DNA sequencing data to estimate tumor cellularity and ploidy, and to calculate allele-specific copy number profiles and mutation profiles. We applied Sequenza, as well as two previously published algorithms, to exome sequence data from 30 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We assessed the performance of these algorithms by comparing their results with those generated using matched SNP arrays and processed by the allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors (ASCAT) algorithm. Results: Comparison between Sequenza/exome and SNP/ASCAT revealed strong correlation in cellularity (Pearson's r = 0.90) and ploidy estimates (r=0.42, or r = 0.94 after manual inspecting alternative solutions). This performance was noticeably superior to previously published algorithms. In addition, in artificial data simulating normal-tumor admixtures, Sequenza detected the correct ploidy in samples with tumor content as low as 30%. Conclusions: The agreement between Sequenza and SNP array-based copy number profiles suggests that exome sequencing alone is sufficient not only for identifying small scale mutations but also for estimating cellularity and inferring DNA copy number aberrations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer genomics", "Copy number alterations", "Mutations", "Next-generation sequencing", "Software"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Alleles", "Base Sequence", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Exome", "Gene Dosage", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Mutation", "Neoplasms", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922572688", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56638105200": {"Name": "Favero F.", "AuthorID": "56638105200", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "54395606700": {"Name": "Joshi T.", "AuthorID": "54395606700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "56950920700": {"Name": "Marquard A.", "AuthorID": "56950920700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "37005365300": {"Name": "Birkbak N.", "AuthorID": "37005365300", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "36087622900": {"Name": "Krzystanek M.", "AuthorID": "36087622900", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "55578517900": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "55578517900", "AffiliationID": "60018205", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, Xiamen University"}, "57203030767": {"Name": "Szallasi Z.", "AuthorID": "57203030767", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60097350, 60030521", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital Informatics Program (CHIP), Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Tehnology (HST), Harvard Medical School"}, "8057455300": {"Name": "Eklund A.", "AuthorID": "8057455300", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}}}
