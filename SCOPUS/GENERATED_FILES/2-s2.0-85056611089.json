Recently introduced geometric Implicit Skinning methods can solve contact interactions and skin elasticity with results comparable to physics-based simulation in real-time. In this paper we introduce an animation method that adds anatomical plausibility while benefiting from the advantages of Implicit Skinning. We propose an efficient way to model muscle primitives with implicit surfaces. Volumetric extrusions of individual muscles are attached to muscle center lines simulated with a fast, low-dimensional physics-based approach (Position Based Dynamics of one-dimensional line segments). This combination of physics-based simulation with implicit modeling allows us to elegantly resolve muscle-muscle and muscle-bone collisions and add dynamic effects such as flesh jiggling while guaranteeing volume preservation (which is a property of real biological muscles) and producing visually plausible skin-skin contact behavior. Our method runs at interactive frame-rates and features intuitive modeling parameters which allow animators to quickly explore a variety of designs and physics-based effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D animation", "Computer graphics", "Implicit skinning", "Muscle deformers", "Skinning"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D animation", "Deformers", "Implicit skinning", "Interactive frame rates", "Low dimensional physics", "Physics-based methods", "Physics-based Simulation", "Skinning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056611089", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55191272500": {"Name": "Roussellet V.", "AuthorID": "55191272500", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse"}, "56572894000": {"Name": "Abu Rumman N.", "AuthorID": "56572894000", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse"}, "55785229000": {"Name": "Canezin F.", "AuthorID": "55785229000", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse"}, "55785283300": {"Name": "Mellado N.", "AuthorID": "55785283300", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse"}, "6603874537": {"Name": "Barthe L.", "AuthorID": "6603874537", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "IRIT, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse"}, "57220380849": {"Name": "Kavan L.", "AuthorID": "57220380849", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, University of Utah"}}}
