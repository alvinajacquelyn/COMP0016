Employing pulsed excitation light, high bandwidths (up to 100 MHz) and pressures (MPa range for unfocussed sources) have been achieved with materials that combine strong optical absorption with a high thermal expansion coefficient, such as carbon nanotube (CNT)-loaded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). However, literature suggests (Buma et al., IEEE tUFFC 50:9) that such composite materials often suffer from high acoustical attenuation, which limits the generated bandwidths and pressures. In this work, we present the broadband acoustical characterisation of both pure and CNT-loaded PDMS samples to assess the contributions of both constituents to the sound speed and attenuation coefficient.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039452889", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57200169959": {"Name": "Alles E.", "AuthorID": "57200169959", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56150220800": {"Name": "Colchester R.", "AuthorID": "56150220800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57132035600": {"Name": "Heo J.", "AuthorID": "57132035600", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36024934800": {"Name": "Baac H.", "AuthorID": "36024934800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
