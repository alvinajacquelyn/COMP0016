This article examines within the context of the experience economy how these digital images aim to evoke and manipulate specific place atmospheres to emphasise the experiential qualities of new buildings and urban environments. In particular, we argue that computer-generated images are far from 'just' glossy representations but are a new form of visualising the urban that captures and markets particular embodied sensations. Drawing on a 2-year qualitative study of architects' practices that worked on the Msheireb project, a large-scale redevelopment project in Doha (Qatar), we examine how digital visualisation technology enables the virtual engineering of sensory experiences using a wide range of graphic effects. We show how these computer-generated images are laboriously materialised in order to depict and present specific sensory, embodied regimes and affective experiences to appeal to clients and consumers. Such development has two key implications. First, we demonstrate the importance of digital technologies in framing the 'expressive infrastructure' of the experience economy. Second, we argue that although the Msheireb computer-generated images open up a field of negotiation between producers and the Qatari client, and work quite hard at being culturally specific, they ultimately draw 'on a Westnocentric literary and sensory palette' that highlights the continuing influence of colonial sensibilities in supposedly postcolonial urban processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Architecture", "Atmosphere", "Computer-generated image", "Digital visualisation", "Doha", "Experience economy", "Qatar", "Senses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018690295", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"9239263600": {"Name": "Degen M.", "AuthorID": "9239263600", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Sciences, Media and Communication, Brunel University London"}, "56217601800": {"Name": "Melhuish C.", "AuthorID": "56217601800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7403282561": {"Name": "Rose G.", "AuthorID": "7403282561", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University"}}}
