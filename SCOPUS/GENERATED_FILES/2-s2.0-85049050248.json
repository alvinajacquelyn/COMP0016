Mutation Deduction makes use of the relationship between the syntactic changes and semantic changes of a program under test: a new type of metamorphic relation. A metamorphic? relation is supposed to hold as long as the program is correct. Once a metamorphic relation is violated, one could deem that abnormal behaviours exist. The framework is supposed to apply to both single-version and multi-version scenarios. It enlarges the behaviour space that the current test inputs could explore, which could help observe more abnormal behaviours and better ensure software quality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mutation deduction", "Mutation testing", "Program behaviour exploration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormal behaviours", "Current test", "Metamorphic relations", "Multi-version", "Mutation deduction", "Mutation testing", "Software Quality"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049050248", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"36505536200": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "36505536200", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60025256", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University, MoE, Institute of Software, EECS, Peking University"}, "23388889700": {"Name": "Hao D.", "AuthorID": "23388889700", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60025256", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University, MoE, Institute of Software, EECS, Peking University"}, "56275778800": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "56275778800", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60025256", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University, MoE, Institute of Software, EECS, Peking University"}, "57203347002": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "57203347002", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas"}}}
