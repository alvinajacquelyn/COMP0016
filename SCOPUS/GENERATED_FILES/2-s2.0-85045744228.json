Methods Three hundred ninety-Two adults enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center) completed a lumbar puncture and at least 2 biennial or annual neuropsychological evaluations. Cutoffs for A\u03b2 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau were developed via receiver operating characteristic curve analyses on a sample of 78 participants (38 dementia, 40 controls). These cutoffs were applied to a separate sample of 314 cognitively healthy adults (mean age at CSF collection = 61.5 years), and mixed-effects regression analyses tested linear and quadratic interactions of biomarker group \u00d7 age at each visit on cognitive and hippocampal volume outcomes. Results Two hundred fifteen participants (69%) were biomarker negative (preclinical AD stage 0), 46 (15%) were A\u03b2+ only (preclinical AD stage 1), 25 (8%) were A\u03b2+ and tau+ (preclinical AD stage 2), and 28 (9%) were tau+ only. Both stage 1 and stage 2 groups exhibited greater rates of linear decline on story memory and processing speed measures, and nonlinear decline on list-learning and set-shifting measures compared to stage 0. The tau+ only group did not significantly differ from stage 0 in rates of cognitive decline. Conclusion In an asymptomatic at-risk cohort, elevated CSF A\u03b2 (with or without elevated tau) was associated with greater rates of cognitive decline, with the specific pattern of decline varying across cognitive measures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Middle Aged", "Phosphorylation", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Risk", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045744228", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57197355541": {"Name": "Clark L.R.", "AuthorID": "57197355541", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"}, "7006820761": {"Name": "Asthana S.", "AuthorID": "7006820761", "AffiliationID": "121401634", "AffiliationName": "Medical Scientist and Neuroscience Training Programs"}, "57201598532": {"Name": "Johnson S.C.", "AuthorID": "57201598532", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"}, "7103143605": {"Name": "Carlsson C.M.", "AuthorID": "7103143605", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"}, "56825158200": {"Name": "Berman S.E.", "AuthorID": "56825158200", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory"}, "57190303290": {"Name": "Norton D.", "AuthorID": "57190303290", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "16836159200": {"Name": "Bendlin B.B.", "AuthorID": "16836159200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"}, "23994091600": {"Name": "Koscik R.L.", "AuthorID": "23994091600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"}, "36100193100": {"Name": "Jonaitis E.", "AuthorID": "36100193100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}}}
