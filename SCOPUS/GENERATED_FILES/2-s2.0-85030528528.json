The HSR is evolutionarily well conserved and has been widely studied in bacteria, cell lines and lower eukaryotic model organisms. However, mechanistic insights into the HSR in higher eukaryotes, in particular in mammals, are limited. We have developed an in vivo heat shock protocol to analyze the HSR in mice and dissected heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-dependent and-independent pathways. Whilst the induction of proteostasis-related genes was dependent on HSF1, the regulation of circadian function related genes, indicating that the circadian clock oscillators have been reset, was independent of its presence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the in vivo HSR is impaired in mouse models of Huntington's disease but we were unable to corroborate the general repression of transcription that follows a heat shock in lower eukaryotes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Circadian Clocks", "Disease Models, Animal", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Heat Shock Transcription Factors", "Heat-Shock Response", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Mice"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030528528", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22951033400": {"Name": "Neueder A.", "AuthorID": "22951033400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57195960226": {"Name": "Batterton S.", "AuthorID": "57195960226", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56224071100": {"Name": "Lazell H.", "AuthorID": "56224071100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55745752900": {"Name": "Farshim P.", "AuthorID": "55745752900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35380748900": {"Name": "Bates G.", "AuthorID": "35380748900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55966606300": {"Name": "Gipson T.", "AuthorID": "55966606300", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57210223623": {"Name": "Housman D.", "AuthorID": "57210223623", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57201652121": {"Name": "Paganetti P.", "AuthorID": "57201652121", "AffiliationID": "119551006", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Biomedical Neuroscience, Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, EOC, C/o SIRM"}}}
