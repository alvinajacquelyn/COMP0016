Methods: 180 children with dystonia underwent assessment for Globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS, mean age 10 years (range 2.5\u201319). CMCT to each limb was calculated using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Median and posterior tibial nerve SEPs were recorded over contralateral and midline centro-parietal scalp. Structural abnormalities were assessed with cranial MRI. One-year outcome from DBS was assessed as percentage improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS-m). Results: Abnormal CMCTs and SEPs were found in 19% and 47% of children respectively and were observed more frequently in secondary than primary dystonia. Of children proceeding to DBS, better outcome was seen in those with normal (n = 78/89) versus abnormal CMCT (n = 11/89) (p = 0.002) and those with normal (n = 35/51) versus abnormal SEPs (n = 16/51) (p = 0.001). These relationships were independent of dystonia aetiology and cranial MRI findings. Conclusions: CMCTs and SEPs provide objective evidence of motor and sensory pathway dysfunction in children with dystonia and relate to DBS outcome. Significance: CMCTs and SEPs can contribute to patient selection and counselling of families about potential benefit from neuromodulation for dystonia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central Motor Conduction Time", "Children", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dystonia", "Dystonic cerebral palsy", "Secondary", "Somatosensory Evoked Potentials"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dystonia", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Female", "Globus Pallidus", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Neural Conduction", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039414360", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"9735062100": {"Name": "McClelland V.M.", "AuthorID": "9735062100", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Complex Motor Disorder Service, Children's Neurosciences Department, Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202875294": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875294", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "54893114200": {"Name": "Gimeno H.", "AuthorID": "54893114200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57200100175": {"Name": "Lin J.P.", "AuthorID": "57200100175", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Complex Motor Disorder Service, Children's Neurosciences Department, Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8954482200": {"Name": "Fialho D.", "AuthorID": "8954482200", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200087725": {"Name": "Flexney-Briscoe D.", "AuthorID": "57200087725", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102202117": {"Name": "Holder G.E.", "AuthorID": "7102202117", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55635215000": {"Name": "Elze M.C.", "AuthorID": "55635215000", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "F.
