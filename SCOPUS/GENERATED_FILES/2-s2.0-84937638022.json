This politics concerns the various strategic acts of naming the national language at different periods of the country's history that have shaped its fate as the most hegemonic indigenous Philippine language. Tagalog, Pilipino and Filipino have been names given to the national language, each loaded with ideological, political and historical significance. Against English, \u2018p\u2019 was appropriated through the renaming of Tagalog as Pilipino; against all other Philippine languages, \u2018f\u2019 was institutionalized through Filipino to symbolize the multilingual nature of the national language. Thus, the machinations of \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 show that the national language is a story of the triumph of the Tagalog language over the vernacular languages. Filipinos have fought colonial rule for centuries, but hegemonic visions of a collective national(ist) struggle and identity have likewise exposed the country to its internal struggles over power and control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Filipino", "national language", "Philippines", "politics of language", "Tagalog"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937638022", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"24074902200": {"Name": "Tupas R.", "AuthorID": "24074902200", "AffiliationID": "60010940, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
