It is shown that the Abraham model can be used to satisfactorily correlate the measured enthalpies of solvation in 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol to within standard deviations of 2.86 kJ/mole for 131 data points, 2.67 kJ/mole for 92 data points and 2.89 kJ/mole for 84 data points, respectively. The derived equations were validated by training set and test set analyses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham model correlations", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "alcohol solvents", "enthalpies of solvation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham model", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "Alcohol solvent", "Data points", "Enthalpy of solvation", "Organic solutes", "Standard deviation", "Training sets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930418451", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538213300": {"Name": "Zettl H.", "AuthorID": "56538213300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538081100": {"Name": "Grover D.", "AuthorID": "56538081100", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
