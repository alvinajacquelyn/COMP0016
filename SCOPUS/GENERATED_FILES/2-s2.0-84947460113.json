All rights reserved.Objective: To assess neurocognitive function at the first-line antiretroviral therapy failure and change on the second-line therapy. Design: Randomized controlled trial was conducted in 5 sub- Saharan African countries. Methods: Patients failing the first-line therapy according to WHO criteria after >12 months on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors-based regimens were randomized to the second-line therapy (open-label) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus either 2-3 clinician-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, raltegravir, or as monotherapy after 12-week induction with raltegravir. Neurocognitive function was tested at baseline, weeks 48 and 96 using color trails tests 1 and 2, and the Grooved Pegboard test. Test results were converted to an average of the 3 individual test z-scores. Results: A total of 1036 patients (90% of those >18 years enrolled at 13 evaluable sites) had valid baseline tests (58% women, median: 38 years, viral load: 65,000 copies per milliliter, CD4 count: 73 cells per cubic millimeter). Mean (SD) baseline z-score was 22.96 (1.74); lower baseline z-scores were independently associated with older age, lower body weight, higher viral load, lower hemoglobin, less education, fewer weekly working hours, previous central nervous system disease, and taking fluconazole (P <0.05 in multivariable model). Z-score was increased by mean (SE) of +1.23 (0.04) after 96 weeks on the second-line therapy (P <0.001; n = 915 evaluable), with no evidence of difference between the treatment arms (P = 0.35). Conclusions: Patients in sub-Saharan Africa failing the first-line therapy had low neurocognitive function test scores, but performance improved on the second-line therapy. Regimens with more central nervous system-penetrating drugs did not enhance neurocognitive recovery indicating this need not be a primary consideration in choosing a second-line regimen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Antiretroviral therapy", "Failure", "Neurocognitive function", "Second line", "Trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Cognition", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Lopinavir", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurocognitive Disorders", "Raltegravir Potassium", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "Ritonavir", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947460113", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"24080475700": {"Name": "Kambugu A.", "AuthorID": "24080475700", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Research Program, Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University"}, "56783334300": {"Name": "Thompson J.", "AuthorID": "56783334300", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "56269903900": {"Name": "Hoppe A.", "AuthorID": "56269903900", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "6506318874": {"Name": "Arenas-Pinto A.", "AuthorID": "6506318874", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7403745869": {"Name": "Walker S.", "AuthorID": "7403745869", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7101820336": {"Name": "Paton N.", "AuthorID": "7101820336", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "7102948186": {"Name": "Hakim J.", "AuthorID": "7102948186", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe Clinical Research Centre"}, "23101742700": {"Name": "Tumukunde D.", "AuthorID": "23101742700", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC)"}, "56966747100": {"Name": "Abach J.", "AuthorID": "56966747100", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC)"}, "8650506700": {"Name": "Van Oosterhout J.", "AuthorID": "8650506700", "AffiliationID": "60111561", "AffiliationName": "Dignitas International"}, "6508073782": {"Name": "Mwebaze R.", "AuthorID": "6508073782", "AffiliationID": "113110453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, St. Francis of Nsambya Hospital"}, "56136369200": {"Name": "Kwobah C.", "AuthorID": "56136369200", "AffiliationID": "60039289", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Centre, Moi University School of Medicine"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
