Friendlessness (defined as lacking any friendship that is mutually reciprocated) is conceptually and empirically distinct from group popularity and independently predicts adverse mental health outcomes throughout life. Here, we respond to the thoughtful commentaries by Wellman (Brit. J. Dev. Psychol, 2015; 33, 24-26), Mizokawa and Koyasu (Brit. J. Dev. Psychol, 2015; 33, 21-23), and Lerner and Lillard (Brit. J. Dev. Psychol, 2015; 33, 18-20) with a focus on three key issues, namely (a) the definition and measurement of friendship, (b) the measurement of advanced ToM development beyond the preschool years, and (c) the exciting future potential for ToM-based training and intervention studies to combat chronic friendlessness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child Development", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Social Isolation", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922569715", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"55329958600": {"Name": "Fink E.", "AuthorID": "55329958600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6505919913": {"Name": "Begeer S.", "AuthorID": "6505919913", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "VU University"}, "7402987890": {"Name": "Peterson C.", "AuthorID": "7402987890", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "University of Queensland"}, "8051623100": {"Name": "Slaughter V.", "AuthorID": "8051623100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "University of Queensland"}, "57203088981": {"Name": "de Rosnay M.", "AuthorID": "57203088981", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "University of Wollongong"}}}
