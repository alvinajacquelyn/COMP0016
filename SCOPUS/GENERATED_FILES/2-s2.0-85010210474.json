The proposed device is based on a soft inflating vessel which is integrated and validated on the hands of a humanoid robot WALK-MAN. The system incorporates an active pressure control unit with on-off solenoid valves that permit the regulation of the air pressure of the protection chamber. The impact protection system is smaller and lighter than a rubber-based passive protection previously mounted on the hands, while it offers better impact reduction performance via fast and accurate pressure control. The effectiveness of the system is verified by actual physical interaction experiments with WALK-MAN while the robot is falling against an inclined surface, making contact with its hands to support its body and prevent falling and damage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active compliant", "Active pressure control", "Humanoid robot", "Impact protection", "Impact reduction", "Inclined surface", "Passive protection", "Physical interactions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010210474", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"16310292700": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "16310292700", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "55732415700": {"Name": "Choi W.", "AuthorID": "55732415700", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "26023306800": {"Name": "Kanoulas D.", "AuthorID": "26023306800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "57193026213": {"Name": "Subburaman R.", "AuthorID": "57193026213", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "7202685497": {"Name": "Caldwell D.", "AuthorID": "7202685497", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "56275172000": {"Name": "Tsagarakis N.", "AuthorID": "56275172000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}}}
