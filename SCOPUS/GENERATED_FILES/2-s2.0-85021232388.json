We focus on how the system and the data it produced are articulated in the interactions between professional energy advisors and their clients, and how they collaboratively anticipate, rehearse, and perform data work. In addition to documenting how the system was appropriated in advisory work, we elaborate the \u2018overhead cost\u2019 of building collaborative action into connected devices and sensing systems, and the commensurate need to support discrete workflows and accountability systems to enable the methodical incorporation of the IoT into collaborative action. We contribute an elaboration of the social, collaborative methods of data work relevant to those who seek to design and study collaborative IoT systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative work", "CSCW", "Ethnomethodology", "Internet of things"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accountability systems", "Face to face", "Low incomes", "Overhead costs", "Sensing systems", "Work-flows"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021232388", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36095705300": {"Name": "Fischer J.", "AuthorID": "36095705300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham"}, "7004457214": {"Name": "Crabtree A.", "AuthorID": "7004457214", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham"}, "55841380900": {"Name": "Colley J.", "AuthorID": "55841380900", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham"}, "7003488009": {"Name": "Rodden T.", "AuthorID": "7003488009", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College London"}}}
