Summary: Augmented reality (AR) is defined as \u201ca technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user\u2019s view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.\u201d 1 This case report describes how emerging AR telesurgery technologies may be used to facilitate international surgeon\u2013surgeon collaboration and training. Here, we illustrate how a remote surgeon in Beirut, Lebanon, was able to offer assistance to a surgeon in Gaza, Palestine, during a complex hand reconstruction case following a bomb-blast injury in an 18-year-old male. We discuss the implications of AR technology on the future of global surgery and how it may be used to reduce structural inequities in access to safe surgical care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057651398", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57200383311": {"Name": "Greenfield M.J.", "AuthorID": "57200383311", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}, "57189040949": {"Name": "Luck J.", "AuthorID": "57189040949", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56365967800": {"Name": "Billingsley M.L.", "AuthorID": "56365967800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St. Georges University Medical School, University of London"}, "57193752244": {"Name": "Heyes R.", "AuthorID": "57193752244", "AffiliationID": "113051862", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden"}, "54881691700": {"Name": "Smith O.J.", "AuthorID": "54881691700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55985666400": {"Name": "Mosahebi A.", "AuthorID": "55985666400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "54390971700": {"Name": "Hachach-Haram N.", "AuthorID": "54390971700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57208543691": {"Name": "Khoussa A.", "AuthorID": "57208543691", "AffiliationID": "100817521", "AffiliationName": "Al-Shifa Hospital"}, "38662213600": {"Name": "Abu-Sittah G.", "AuthorID": "38662213600", "AffiliationID": "60068762", "AffiliationName": "American University of Beirut Medical Centre"}}}
