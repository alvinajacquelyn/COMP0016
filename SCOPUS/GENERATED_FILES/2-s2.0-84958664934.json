This study sought to validate this measure by comparing NEO facet correlational results with other studies. The Sceptical score from the HDS was the criterion variable in the correlations and multiple regressions. Sceptical people were Disagreeable, Neurotic, and Conscientious. Facet analysis showed them low on Trust, Compliance, and Straightforwardness but high on Depression and Angry Hostility. Limitations of the study are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domains", "Facets", "Paranoia", "Personality traits", "Sceptical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958664934", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "BI: Norwegian Business School"}, "36985893700": {"Name": "Crump J.", "AuthorID": "36985893700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University College London"}}}
