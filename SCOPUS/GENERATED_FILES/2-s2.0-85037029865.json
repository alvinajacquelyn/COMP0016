This study aims to estimate the burden of educational class inequalities in stroke incidence and to assess the contribution of risk factors in determining these inequalities across Europe. Materials and methods The MORGAM (MOnica Risk, Genetics, Archiving and Monograph) Study comprises 48 cohorts recruited mostly in the 1980s and 1990s in four European regions using standardised procedures for baseline risk factor assessment and fatal and non-fatal stroke ascertainment and adjudication during follow-up. Among the 126 635 middle-aged participants, initially free of cardiovascular diseases, generating 3788 first stroke events during a median follow-up of 10 years, we estimated differences in stroke rates and HRs for the least versus the most educated individuals. Results Compared with their most educated counterparts, the overall age-adjusted excess hazard for stroke was 1.54 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.91) and 1.41 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.71) in least educated men and women, respectively, with little heterogeneity across populations. Educational class inequalities accounted for 86-413 and 78-156 additional stroke events per 100 000 person-years in the least compared with most educated men and women, respectively. The additional events were equivalent to 47%-130% and 40%-89% of the average incidence rates. Inequalities in risk factors accounted for 45%-70% of the social gap in incidence in the Nordic countries, the UK and Lithuania-Kaunas (men), but for no more than 17% in Central and South Europe. The major contributors were cigarette smoking, alcohol intake and body mass index. Conclusions Social inequalities in stroke incidence contribute substantially to the disease rates in Europe. Healthier lifestyles in the most disadvantaged individuals should have a prominent impact in reducing both inequalities and the stroke burden.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort studies", "social epidemiology", "social inequalities", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcohol Drinking", "Cohort Studies", "Educational Status", "Europe", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Scandinavian and Nordic Countries", "Sex Factors", "Smoking", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037029865", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7006049937": {"Name": "Ferrario M.M.", "AuthorID": "7006049937", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Centro Ricerche EPIMED-Epidemiologia e Prevenzione, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'Insubria"}, "23567331000": {"Name": "Veronesi G.", "AuthorID": "23567331000", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Centro Ricerche EPIMED-Epidemiologia e Prevenzione, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'Insubria"}, "57205867300": {"Name": "Iacoviello L.", "AuthorID": "57205867300", "AffiliationID": "60023773", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Mediterraneo Neuromed"}, "57216606715": {"Name": "Kee F.", "AuthorID": "57216606715", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health Research, Queens University Belfast"}, "7005719506": {"Name": "Chambless L.E.", "AuthorID": "7005719506", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "7004232837": {"Name": "Kuulasmaa K.", "AuthorID": "7004232837", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "THL-National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "7004714461": {"Name": "Salomaa V.", "AuthorID": "7004714461", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "THL-National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57203072655": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen T.", "AuthorID": "57203072655", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg University"}, "7101751541": {"Name": "Amouyel P.", "AuthorID": "7101751541", "AffiliationID": "60000445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Pasteur Institute of Lille"}, "7006673179": {"Name": "Arveiler D.", "AuthorID": "7006673179", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, EA 3430, FMTS, University of Strasbourg"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7006053466": {"Name": "Cesana G.", "AuthorID": "7006053466", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Centro Studi e Ricerche in Sanit\u00e0 Pubblica, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca"}, "6603867631": {"Name": "Drygas W.", "AuthorID": "6603867631", "AffiliationID": "60085669", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, CVD Prevention and Health Promotion, National Institute of Cardiology"}, "57202594672": {"Name": "Ferrieres J.", "AuthorID": "57202594672", "AffiliationID": "60102124", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Toulouse University, School of Medicine"}, "55168056600": {"Name": "Giampaoli S.", "AuthorID": "55168056600", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Dysmetabolic and Ageing-Assoc.
