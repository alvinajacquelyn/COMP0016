Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine (PN) is one of the most widespread pharmacological therapies for inherited diseases involving pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, including primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1). PH1 is caused by a deficiency of liver-peroxisomal alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which allows glyoxylate oxidation to oxalate leading to the deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidney. Only a minority of PH1 patients, mostly bearing the F152I and G170R mutations, respond to PN, the only pharmacological treatment currently available. Moreover, excessive doses of PN reduce the specific activity of AGT in a PH1 cellular model. Nevertheless, the possible effect(s) of other B6 vitamers has not been investigated previously. Here, we compared the ability of PN in rescuing the effects of the F152I and G170R mutations with that of pyridoxamine (PM) and PL. We found that supplementation with PN raises the intracellular concentration of PN phosphate (PNP), which competes with PLP for apoenzyme binding leading to the formation of an inactive AGT-PNP complex. In contrast, PNP does not accumulate in the cell upon PM or PL supplementation, but higher levels of PLP and PM phosphate (PMP), the two active forms of the AGTcoenzyme, are found. This leads to an increased ability ofPMand PL to rescue the effects of the F152I and G170R mutations compared with PN. A similar effect was also observed for other folding-defective AGT variants. Thus, PM and PL should be investigated as matter of importance as therapeutics for PH1 patients bearing folding mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Humans", "Hyperoxaluria, Primary", "Mutation", "Protein Folding", "Pyridoxal", "Pyridoxamine", "Pyridoxine", "Transaminases", "Vitamin B Complex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943807001", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"36087751700": {"Name": "Oppici E.", "AuthorID": "36087751700", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Reproduction Sciences, Section of Biological Chemistry, University of Verona"}, "6506874304": {"Name": "Cellini B.", "AuthorID": "6506874304", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Reproduction Sciences, Section of Biological Chemistry, University of Verona"}, "14043359300": {"Name": "Fargue S.", "AuthorID": "14043359300", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "56898619300": {"Name": "Reid E.", "AuthorID": "56898619300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006050208": {"Name": "Danpure C.", "AuthorID": "7006050208", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
