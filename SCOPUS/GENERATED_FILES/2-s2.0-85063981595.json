We studied 7,597 consecutive STEMI patients (13.8% women, n = 1,045) who underwent pPCI from January 2007 to December 2013. Cox regression models adjusted for competing risk from death were used to assess sex differences in rehospitalization for HF and MI within 1 year from discharge. Compared with men, women were older (median age 67.6 vs 56.0 years, p < 0.001) with higher prevalence of co-morbidities and multivessel disease. Women had longer median door-to-balloon time (76 vs 66 minutes, p < 0.001) and were less likely to receive drug-eluting stents (19.5% vs 24.1%, p = 0.001). Of the medications prescribed at discharge, fewer women received aspirin (95.8% vs 97.6%, p = 0.002) and P2Y12 antagonists (97.6% vs 98.5%, p = 0.039), but there were no significant sex differences in other discharge medications. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and treatment, sex differences in risk of rehospitalization for HF attenuated (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.40), but persisted for MI (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.33), with greater disparity in patients aged \u226560 years (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.85) than those aged <60 years (HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.50). In conclusion, in a setting of universal access to pPCI, the adjusted risk of 1-year rehospitalization for HF was similar in both sexes, but women had significantly higher adjusted risk of 1-year rehospitalization for MI, especially older women.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Drug-Eluting Stents", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Patient Readmission", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Retrospective Studies", "Sex Factors", "Time Factors", "Time-to-Treatment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063981595", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56844093200": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "56844093200", "AffiliationID": "107044936", "AffiliationName": "National Registry of Diseases Office, Health Promotion Board"}, "57203726642": {"Name": "Foo L.L.", "AuthorID": "57203726642", "AffiliationID": "107044936", "AffiliationName": "National Registry of Diseases Office, Health Promotion Board"}, "7403011676": {"Name": "Tan H.C.", "AuthorID": "7403011676", "AffiliationID": "60106366, 60031325", "AffiliationName": "National University Heart Centre, National University Hospital"}, "35215731400": {"Name": "Lee C.H.", "AuthorID": "35215731400", "AffiliationID": "60106366, 60031325", "AffiliationName": "National University Heart Centre, National University Hospital"}, "7102950176": {"Name": "Low A.F.H.", "AuthorID": "7102950176", "AffiliationID": "60106366, 60031325", "AffiliationName": "National University Heart Centre, National University Hospital"}, "23388249600": {"Name": "Chan M.Y.", "AuthorID": "23388249600", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "7402299599": {"Name": "Richards A.M.", "AuthorID": "7402299599", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University of Singapore"}, "7404256298": {"Name": "Chan S.P.", "AuthorID": "7404256298", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University of Singapore"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre"}, "19934204100": {"Name": "Lam C.S.P.", "AuthorID": "19934204100", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre"}, "14829599000": {"Name": "Tan J.W.C.", "AuthorID": "14829599000", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre"}, "6507365717": {"Name": "Sahlen A.O.", "AuthorID": "6507365717", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet"}, "16644168800": {"Name": "Yeo K.K.", "AuthorID": "16644168800", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre"}, "57217276064": {"Name": "Chua T.S.J.", "AuthorID": "57217276064", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre"}, "7401465369": {"Name": "Ho H.H.", "AuthorID": "7401465369", "AffiliationID": "60002481", "AffiliationName": "Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "57194159332": {"Name": "Chai S.C.", "AuthorID": "57194159332", "AffiliationID": "60013022", "AffiliationName": "Changi General Hospital"}, "57215907486": {"Name": "Tong K.L.", "AuthorID": "57215907486", "AffiliationID": "60013022", "AffiliationName": "Changi General Hospital"}, "50263435900": {"Name": "Tan D.S.Y.", "AuthorID": "50263435900", "AffiliationID": "60104613", "AffiliationName": "Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"}}}
