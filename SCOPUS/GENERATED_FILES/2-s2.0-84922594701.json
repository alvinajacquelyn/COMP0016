Methods: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included children aged 3-18 years, from five Finnish University cities, with participants chosen randomly from the national population registrar from those areas. The age of participants included in the current analyses in childhood (1980) ranged from three to nine years and in mid-adulthood (2011) ranged from 34 to 40 years (complete data n = 657). Measures of retinal microvasculature architecture measured in adulthood included diameters, tortuosity, lengths, and LDR. Results: Regression analysis showed a strong negative association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar diameter (standardized regression coefficient [\u03b2] -0.300; p < 0.001) and with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood (\u03b2 = -0.249; p < 0.001). For arteriolar tortuosity, there was a strong positive association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar tortuosity (\u03b2 = 0.154; p < 0.001) and no association with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood (\u03b2 = 0.072; p = 0.110). Conclusions: High BP in childhood and increased BP from childhood to adulthood impacts on retinal microvascular architecture in mid-adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood pressure", "Cardiovascular disease", "Epidemiology", "Life course", "Retinal microvasculature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aging", "Arterioles", "Blood Pressure", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Male", "Microcirculation", "Retinal Vessels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922594701", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7004191809": {"Name": "Tapp R.J.", "AuthorID": "7004191809", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "16679281400": {"Name": "Hussain S.M.", "AuthorID": "16679281400", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "15748954800": {"Name": "Battista J.", "AuthorID": "15748954800", "AffiliationID": "60028040", "AffiliationName": "The National Vision Research Institute, The Australian College of Optometry"}, "7003450942": {"Name": "Metha A.", "AuthorID": "7003450942", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "6603582807": {"Name": "Hutri-K\u00e4h\u00f6nen N.", "AuthorID": "6603582807", "AffiliationID": "60011170, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital"}, "7006539182": {"Name": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T.", "AuthorID": "7006539182", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories and School of Medicine University of Tampere"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6507679364": {"Name": "Mcg Thom S.A.", "AuthorID": "6507679364", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, St Mary's Hospital and Imperial College"}, "7004828916": {"Name": "Raitakari O.T.", "AuthorID": "7004828916", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Turku University Hospital"}, "7006708451": {"Name": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M.", "AuthorID": "7006708451", "AffiliationID": "60011170, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Tampere University Hospital and the University of Tampere"}}}
