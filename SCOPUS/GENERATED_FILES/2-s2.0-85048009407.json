The line spacing, exactly determined by a microwave reference, can be continuously tuned and, by heterodyning two lines, enables the generation of a continuously tunable electrical signal from 122.5 GHz to >2.7 THz. The composite noise of the heterodyne between two lines has been measured up to a record frequency of 300 GHz and is \u221275 dBc\u2215Hz at 10 kHz offset at 300 GHz, limited by the multiplied phase noise of the reference synthesizer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical signal", "Line spacing", "Optical combs", "Optical frequency comb generators", "Single phase", "THz signal", "Two-line"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048009407", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
