In this work we present a novel laparoscope camera coupler based on an electrically tunable fluidic lens that permits programmable focus control and has desirable achromatic performance from the visible to the NIR. Its use extends the lower working distance limit and improves detection sensitivity, important for work with molecularly targeted fluorescence markers. We demonstrate its superior optical performance in laparoscopic fluorescence-guided surgery. In vivo results using a tumor specific molecular probe and a nonspecific NIR dye are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Detection sensitivity", "Electrically tunable", "Fluorescence markers", "Guided surgery", "Laparoscopic procedures", "Molecular Probes", "Optical performance", "Working distances"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023615195", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57190421373": {"Name": "Volpi D.", "AuthorID": "57190421373", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "55916094000": {"Name": "Tullis I.D.C.", "AuthorID": "55916094000", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57189587471": {"Name": "Barber P.R.", "AuthorID": "57189587471", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "56469375500": {"Name": "Augustyniak E.M.", "AuthorID": "56469375500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "8927858400": {"Name": "Smart S.C.", "AuthorID": "8927858400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "6701860639": {"Name": "Vallis K.A.", "AuthorID": "6701860639", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57200705365": {"Name": "Vojnovic B.", "AuthorID": "57200705365", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}}}
