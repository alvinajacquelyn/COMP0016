All rights reserved.We describe the Library Event Matching classification algorithm implemented for use in the NO\u03bdA \u03bd\u03bc\u2192\u03bde oscillation measurement. Library Event Matching, developed in a different form by the earlier MINOS experiment, is a powerful approach in which input trial events are compared to a large library of simulated events to find those that best match the input event. A key feature of the algorithm is that the comparisons are based on all the information available in the event, as opposed to higher-level derived quantities. The final event classifier is formed by examining the details of the best-matched library events. We discuss the concept, definition, optimization, and broader applications of the algorithm as implemented here. Library Event Matching is well-suited to the monolithic, segmented detectors of NO\u03bdA and thus provides a powerful technique for event discrimination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification algorithm", "Library matching", "NO\u03bdA", "Particle identification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification algorithm", "Electron neutrino", "Event classification", "Event matching", "Key feature", "Oscillation measurements", "Particle identifications", "Simulated events"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921803996", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57192214384": {"Name": "Backhouse C.", "AuthorID": "57192214384", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Lauritsen Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "17435564700": {"Name": "Patterson R.", "AuthorID": "17435564700", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Lauritsen Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}}}
