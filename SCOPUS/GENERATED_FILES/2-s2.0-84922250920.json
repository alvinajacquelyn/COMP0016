A main effects plan plus its foldover was used to estimate weights for each of the four levels of all five attributes. The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that 'attachment' and 'stability' each account for around 22% of the space, and 'autonomy', 'achievement' and 'enjoyment' account for around 18% each. Across all attributes, greater value was placed on the difference between the lowest levels of capability than between the highest. This tariff will enable ICECAP-A to be used in economic evaluation both within the field of health and across public policy generally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Best-worst scaling", "Capability approach", "Discrete choice experiments", "Economic evaluation", "Variance heterogeneity", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Choice Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Great Britain", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Econometric", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Regression Analysis", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922250920", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"8682983400": {"Name": "Flynn T.", "AuthorID": "8682983400", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Choice (CenSoC), University of Technology Sydney"}, "55933380500": {"Name": "Huynh E.", "AuthorID": "55933380500", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Choice (CenSoC), University of Technology Sydney"}, "57211284405": {"Name": "Peters T.", "AuthorID": "57211284405", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "24330583200": {"Name": "Al-Janabi H.", "AuthorID": "24330583200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55971738500": {"Name": "Coast J.", "AuthorID": "55971738500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55390499500": {"Name": "Clemens S.", "AuthorID": "55390499500", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Social Research"}, "55391170400": {"Name": "Moody A.", "AuthorID": "55391170400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}}}
