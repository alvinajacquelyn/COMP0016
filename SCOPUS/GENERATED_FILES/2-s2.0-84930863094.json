The Val<sup>158</sup>Met polymorphism affects COMT enzymatic activity and has been associated with variation in executive function and affective processing. This study investigated the effect of COMT genotype on the flexible modulation of the balance between processing self-generated and processing stimulus-oriented information, in the presence or absence of affective distractors. Analyses included 124 healthy adult participants, who were also assessed on standard working memory (WM) tasks. Relative to Val carriers, Met homozygotes made fewer errors when selecting and manipulating self-generated thoughts. This effect was partly accounted for by an association between COMT genotype and visuospatial WM performance. We also observed a complex interaction between the influence of affective distractors, COMT genotype and sex on task accuracy: male, but not female, participants showed a sensitivity to the affective distractors that was dependent on COMT genotype. This was not accounted for by WM performance. This study provides novel evidence of the role of dopaminergic genetic variation on the ability to select and manipulate self-generated thoughts. The results also suggest sexually dimorphic effects of COMT genotype on the influence of affective distractors on executive function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective processing", "Behavioural genetics", "COMT", "Executive function", "Prefrontal cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affect", "Attention", "Catechol O-Methyltransferase", "Executive Function", "Female", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Thinking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930863094", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36659657000": {"Name": "Kilford E.J.", "AuthorID": "36659657000", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "12787193300": {"Name": "Dumontheil I.", "AuthorID": "12787193300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "26643513600": {"Name": "Blakemore S.J.", "AuthorID": "26643513600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.W.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
