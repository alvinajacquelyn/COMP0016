Although in vitro activation, or \u201cpriming,\u201d of NK cells by exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, has been extensively studied, the biological consequences of NK cell activation in response to target cell interactions have not been thoroughly characterized. We investigated the consequences of co-incubation with K562, CTV-1, Daudi RPMI-8226, and MCF-7 tumor cell lines on the phenotype, cytokine expression profile, and transcriptome of human NK cells. We observe the downregulation of several activation receptors including CD16, CD62L, C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR)-4, natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D), DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM)-1, and NKp46 following tumor-priming. Although this NK cell phenotype is typically associated with NK cell dysfunction in cancer, we reveal the upregulation of NK cell activation markers, such as CD69 and CD25; secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1) \u03b1 /\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2/6/8; and overexpression of numerous genes associated with enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory functions, such as FAS, TNFSF10, MAPK11, TNF, and IFNG. Thus, it appears that tumor-mediated ligation of receptors on NK cells may induce a primed state which may or may not lead to full triggering of the lytic or cytokine secreting machinery. Key signaling molecules exclusively affected by tumor-priming include MAP2K3, MARCKSL1, STAT5A, and TNFAIP3, which are specifically associated with NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor targets. Collectively, these findings help define the phenotypic and transcriptional signature of NK cells following their encounters with tumor cells, independent of cytokine stimulation, and provide insight into tumor-specific NK cell responses to inform the transition toward harnessing the therapeutic potential of NK cells in cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytokines", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Inflammation Mediators", "K562 Cells", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphocyte Activation", "MCF-7 Cells", "Neoplasms", "Phenotype", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068901550", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54785151700": {"Name": "Sabry M.", "AuthorID": "54785151700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "56495613600": {"Name": "Zubiak A.", "AuthorID": "56495613600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "57209859391": {"Name": "Simmonds P.", "AuthorID": "57209859391", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "57209851937": {"Name": "Arellano-Ballestero H.", "AuthorID": "57209851937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "57189802663": {"Name": "Cournoyer E.", "AuthorID": "57189802663", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "55939461000": {"Name": "Mashar M.", "AuthorID": "55939461000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60171674", "AffiliationName": "InmuneBio Inc."}, "55601631800": {"Name": "Hood S.P.", "AuthorID": "55601631800", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, CR United Kingdom Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "7007115879": {"Name": "Graham Pockley A.", "AuthorID": "7007115879", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University"}}}
