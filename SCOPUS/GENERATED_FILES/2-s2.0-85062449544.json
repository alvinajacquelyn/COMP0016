Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The existing literature suggests that gated communities and master-planned estates represent a form of private governance. They are a response to the state\u2019s retreat from providing public goods. In post-reform China, newer residential development projects also take the form of gated neighbourhoods. To what extent do these neighbourhoods represent a new form of \u201cprivate governance\u201d? Results from the perspective of residents reveal that the meaning of \u201cprivate governance\u201d refers to services delivered by private organisations rather than self-governance. Gated neighbourhoods in urban China are a response to the state\u2019s intention to retreat from serviced land provision while retaining neighbourhood control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gated communities", "Master-planned estates", "private governance", "urban China"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062449544", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57201802897": {"Name": "Lu T.", "AuthorID": "57201802897", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "China Institute for Urban Governance, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "25634980900": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "25634980900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "7403463877": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "7403463877", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
