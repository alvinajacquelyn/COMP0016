A quasi-zero-stiffness (QZS) isolator is a particular case of this type of isolator, which has a zero dynamic stiffness at the static equilibrium position. These types of isolators can be used to achieve very low frequency vibration isolation, but a drawback is that they have purely hardening stiffness behavior. If something occurs to destroy the symmetry of the system, for example, by an additional static load being applied to the isolator during operation, or by the incorrect mass being suspended on the isolator, then the isolator behavior will change dramatically. The question is whether this will be detrimental to the performance of the isolator and this is addressed in this paper. The analysis in this paper shows that although the asymmetry will degrade the performance of the isolator compared to the perfectly tuned case, it will still perform better than the corresponding linear isolator provided that the amplitude of excitation is not too large.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hardening stiffness", "Linear vibration isolators", "Nonlinear isolators", "Performance benefits", "Quasi-zero stiffness", "Static equilibrium", "Very low frequency", "Vibration isolators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925397204", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55535744400": {"Name": "Abolfathi A.", "AuthorID": "55535744400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Stewart Miller Building, Loughborough University"}, "7402656200": {"Name": "Brennan M.", "AuthorID": "7402656200", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, UNESP, Ilha Solteira"}, "7006405678": {"Name": "Waters T.", "AuthorID": "7006405678", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton"}, "36722416400": {"Name": "Tang B.", "AuthorID": "36722416400", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Internal Combustion Engine, Dalian University of Technology"}}}
