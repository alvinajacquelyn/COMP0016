Genetic improvement of software for multiple objective exploration (GISMOE) found code that is 70 times faster (on average) and yet is at least as good functionally. Indeed, it even gives a small semantic gain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automatic software reengineering", "Bowtie2GP", "genetic programming (GP)", "multiple objective exploration", "search based software engineering (SBSE)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Genetic improvements", "Multiple-objectives", "Search based software engineering (SBSE)", "Software reengineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922370717", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"8724450500": {"Name": "Langdon W.", "AuthorID": "8724450500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College"}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College"}}}
