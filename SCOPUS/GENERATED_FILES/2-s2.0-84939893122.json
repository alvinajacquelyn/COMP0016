We contend that if we continue to assume youth mental health services can do no harm, and all that is needed is more services, we continue to risk the possibility that the safety of children and young people is unintentionally compromised. We propose a three level framework for considering harm from youth mental health provision (1. ineffective engagement, 2. ineffective practice and 3. adverse events) and suggest how this framework could be used to support quality improvement in services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child mental health", "Harm", "Safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Guideline Adherence", "Humans", "Inservice Training", "Mental Health", "Mental Health Services", "Patient Safety", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Quality of Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939893122", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit and CORC, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "56281139400": {"Name": "Fleming I.", "AuthorID": "56281139400", "AffiliationID": "112812972", "AffiliationName": "CORC"}, "6603723079": {"Name": "Lachman P.", "AuthorID": "6603723079", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}}}
