This article summarizes efforts that use integrating vectors derived from retroviruses and transposons, and briefly explains integrating vector biology and integration site analysis and recent successful application of this technology in clinical trials. Moreover, outlined is how these vectors can be used for cancer gene discovery and clonal tracking of benign and malignant hematopoiesis to gain insights into the dynamics of hematopoiesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clonal tracking", "Gene therapy", "Hematopoietic dynamics", "Insertion site analysis", "Lentiviral vector", "Retroviral vector", "Stem cells", "Transposon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Tracking", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Clonal Evolution", "DNA Transposable Elements", "Gammaretrovirus", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Lentivirus", "Mutagenesis, Insertional", "Transgenes", "Virus Integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029315562", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"36963939500": {"Name": "Biasco L.", "AuthorID": "36963939500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL Faculty of Population Health Sciences"}, "56661903100": {"Name": "Rothe M.", "AuthorID": "56661903100", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Hematology, REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School"}, "53878493700": {"Name": "Schott J.W.", "AuthorID": "53878493700", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Hematology, REBIRTH Cluster of Excellence, Hannover Medical School"}, "6507714915": {"Name": "Schambach A.", "AuthorID": "6507714915", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
