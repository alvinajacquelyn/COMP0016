Still, there is no consensus on the operating mechanism that regulates the valve opening and closing dynamics. The aim of this study is to develop a numerical model that can support a better comprehension of the valve function and serve as a reference to identify the changes produced by specific pathologies and treatments. Methods: A numerical model was developed and adapted to accurately replicate the conditions of a previous in vitro investigation into aortic valve dynamics, performed by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV). The resulting velocity fields of the two analyses were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to validate the numerical model. In order to simulate more physiological operating conditions, this was then modified to overcome the main limitations of the experimental setup, such as the presence of a supporting stent and the non-physiological properties of the fluid and vessels. Results: The velocity fields of the initial model resulted in good agreement with those obtained from the PIV, with similar flow structures and about 90% of the computed velocities after valve opening within the standard deviation of the equivalent velocity measurements of the in vitro model. Once the experimental limitations were removed from the model, the valve opening dynamics changed substantially, with the leaflets opening into the sinuses to a much greater extent, enlarging the effective orifice area by 11%, and reducing greatly the vortical structures previously observed in proximity of the Valsalva sinuses wall. Conclusions: The study suggests a new operating mechanism for the healthy aortic valve leaflets considerably different from what reported in the literature to date and largely more efficient in terms of hydrodynamic performance. This work also confirms the crucial role that numerical approaches, complemented with experimental findings, can play in overcoming some of the limitations inherent in experimental techniques, supporting the full understanding of complex physiological phenomena.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluid\u2013structure-interaction (FSI)", "Haemodynamics", "Heart valve dynamics", "Valsalva sinus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental techniques", "Haemodynamics", "Heart valves", "Hydrodynamic performance", "Particle image velocimetries", "Physiological functions", "Physiological properties", "Valsalva sinus", "Aortic Valve", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted", "Patient-Specific Modeling", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057766051", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57204894273": {"Name": "Tango A.", "AuthorID": "57204894273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, University College London"}, "57204896794": {"Name": "Salmonsmith J.", "AuthorID": "57204896794", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, University College London"}, "8259228300": {"Name": "Ducci A.", "AuthorID": "8259228300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, University College London"}, "6506017118": {"Name": "Burriesci G.", "AuthorID": "6506017118", "AffiliationID": "116044730", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Group, Ri.MED Foundation"}}}
