However, studies that have assessed whether affective features of words undergo the same processing in a native and nonnative language have provided mixed results: Studies that have found differences between native language (L1) and second language (L2) processing attributed the difference to the fact that L2 learned late in life would not be processed affectively, because affective associations are established during childhood. Other studies suggest that adult learners show similar effects of emotional features in L1 and L2. Differences in affective processing of L2 words can be linked to age and context of learning, proficiency, language dominance, and degree of similarity between L2 and L1. Here, in a lexical decision task on tightly matched negative, positive, and neutral words, highly proficient English speakers from typologically different L1s showed the same facilitation in processing emotionally valenced words as native English speakers, regardless of their L1, the age of English acquisition, or the frequency and context of English use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bilingualism", "Emotion", "Word processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affect", "Age Factors", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Multilingualism", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942816237", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36118188200": {"Name": "Ponari M.", "AuthorID": "36118188200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology Department, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7005928441": {"Name": "Vinson D.", "AuthorID": "7005928441", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology Department, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "37018164500": {"Name": "Fox N.", "AuthorID": "37018164500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology Department, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology Department, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56595158600": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Cuadrado S.", "AuthorID": "56595158600", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain and Cognition, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "7401876506": {"Name": "Costa A.", "AuthorID": "7401876506", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats"}}}
