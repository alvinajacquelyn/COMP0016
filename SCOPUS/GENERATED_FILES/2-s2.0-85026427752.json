This study describes the clinical and molecular genetic features observed in this specific LHON subgroup. Methods Our retrospective study consisted of a UK paediatric LHON cohort of 27 patients and 69 additional cases identified from a systematic review of the literature. Patients were included if visual loss occurred at the age of 12years or younger with a confirmed pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation: M.3460G>A, m.11778G>A or m.14484T>C. Results In the UK paediatric LHON cohort, three patterns of visual loss and progression were observed: (1) classical acute (17/27, 63%); (2) slowly progressive (4/27, 15%); and (3) insidious or subclinical (6/27, 22%). Diagnostic delays of 3-15years occurred in children with an insidious mode of onset. Spontaneous visual recovery was more common in patients carrying the m.3460G>A and m.14484T>C mutations compared with the m.11778G>A mutation. Based a meta-analysis of 67 patients with available visual acuity data, 26 (39%) patients achieved a final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) \u22650.5 Snellen decimal in at least one eye, whereas 13 (19%) patients had a final BCVA <0.05 in their better seeing eye. Conclusions Although childhood-onset LHON carries a relatively better visual prognosis, approximately 1 in 5 patients will remain within the visual acuity criteria for legal blindness in the UK. The clinical presentation can be insidious and LHON should be considered in the differential diagnosis when faced with a child with unexplained subnormal vision and optic disc pallor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child health (paediatrics)", "Diagnostic tests/Investigation", "Genetics", "Optic Nerve", "Vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Optic Atrophy, Hereditary, Leber", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026427752", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6701495229": {"Name": "Majander A.", "AuthorID": "6701495229", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60031970", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, UCSF School of Medicine"}, "16481648300": {"Name": "Yu-Wai-Man P.", "AuthorID": "16481648300", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Eye Centre, Royal Victoria Infirmary"}, "7402242349": {"Name": "Reddy M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402242349", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "12797538000": {"Name": "Bowman R.", "AuthorID": "12797538000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "35476433300": {"Name": "Poulton J.", "AuthorID": "35476433300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford"}, "6701347017": {"Name": "Antcliff R.J.", "AuthorID": "6701347017", "AffiliationID": "60017238", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Royal United Hospital"}, "9533655500": {"Name": "Chinnery P.F.", "AuthorID": "9533655500", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7005774812": {"Name": "Votruba M.", "AuthorID": "7005774812", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60000020", "AffiliationName": "School of Optometry and Vision Sciences, Cardiff University, University Hospital Wales"}}}
