All rights reserved.This chapter explores how Sophocles' Oedipus the King can be viewed in light of changes in sexual and familial relations in the twenty-first century. It argues that Oedipus continues to speak to issues of contemporary identity, just as it did for Freud. The play, like Freud's own theories, becomes like a buried source or origin, but one whose meanings change all the time, in each generation as it is unearthed and reinterpreted in the light of our new day - so like and so unlike the old days.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Familial relations", "Freud", "Identity", "Oedipus", "Plays", "Sexual relations", "Sophocles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938901509", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"26035033700": {"Name": "Bowlby R.", "AuthorID": "26035033700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
