We find 19 850-\u03bcm bright X-ray AGN in a 'high-sensitivity' region covering 0.89 deg2 with flux densities of S850 = 4-10 mJy. The 19 AGN span the full range in redshift and hard X-ray luminosity covered by the sample - 0.7 \u2272 z \u2272 3.5 and 43.2 \u2272 log10(LX) \u2272 45. We report a highly significant stacked 850-\u03bcm detection of a hard X-ray flux-limited population of 699 z > 1 X-ray AGN - S850 = 0.71 \u00b1 0.08 mJy. We explore trends in the stacked 850-\u03bcm flux densities with redshift, finding no evolution in the average cold dust emission over the redshift range probed. For type 1 AGN, there is no significant correlation between the stacked 850-\u03bcm flux and hard X-ray luminosity. However, in type 2 AGN the stacked submillimeter flux is a factor of 2 higher at high luminosities. When averaging over all X-ray luminosities, no significant differences are found in the stacked submillimeter fluxes of type 1 and type 2 AGN as well as AGN separated on the basis of X-ray hardness ratios and optical-to-infrared colours. However, at log10(L2-10/erg s-1) > 44.4, dependences in average submillimeter flux on the optical-to-infrared colours become more pronounced. We argue that these high-luminosity AGN represent a transition from a secular to a merger-driven evolutionary phase where the star formation rates and accretion luminosities are more tightly coupled. Stacked AGN 850-\u03bcm fluxes are compared to the stacked fluxes of a mass-matched sample of K-bandselected non-AGN galaxies. We find that at 10.5 < log10(M*/M\u2299) < 11.5, the non-AGN 850-\u03bcm fluxes are 1.5-2 times higher than in type 2 AGN of equivalent mass. We suggest these differences are due to the presence of massive dusty, red starburst galaxies in the K-band-selected non-AGN sample, which are not present in optically selected catalogues covering a smaller area.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: evolution", "Quasars: general", "Submillimetre: galaxies", "X-rays: galaxies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965077473", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8303094100": {"Name": "Banerji M.", "AuthorID": "8303094100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology, University of Cambridge"}, "24468512900": {"Name": "McMahon R.G.", "AuthorID": "24468512900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology, University of Cambridge"}, "36997177300": {"Name": "Alaghband-Zadeh S.", "AuthorID": "36997177300", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "7003911085": {"Name": "Willott C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003911085", "AffiliationID": "60009839", "AffiliationName": "Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, National Research Council"}, "9242590400": {"Name": "Geach J.E.", "AuthorID": "9242590400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "22937171400": {"Name": "Coppin K.E.K.", "AuthorID": "22937171400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "57202241376": {"Name": "Smith D.J.B.", "AuthorID": "57202241376", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane"}, "55303901800": {"Name": "Harrison C.M.", "AuthorID": "55303901800", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, Department of Physics, Durham University"}, "7402830539": {"Name": "Alexander D.M.", "AuthorID": "7402830539", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, Department of Physics, Durham University"}, "55917471900": {"Name": "Swinbank A.M.", "AuthorID": "55917471900", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, Department of Physics, Durham University"}, "36619471700": {"Name": "Bourne N.", "AuthorID": "36619471700", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60006858, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory"}, "7202804202": {"Name": "Dunlop J.S.", "AuthorID": "7202804202", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60006858, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory"}, "15822545300": {"Name": "Michalowski M.J.", "AuthorID": "15822545300", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60006858, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory"}, "14021335500": {"Name": "Farrah D.", "AuthorID": "14021335500", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Tech"}, "7202161099": {"Name": "Jarvis M.", "AuthorID": "7202161099", "AffiliationID": "60031569", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University of the Western Cape"}, "8740690900": {"Name": "Page M.", "AuthorID": "8740690900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "16318225700": {"Name": "Symeonidis M.", "AuthorID": "16318225700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7005314734": {"Name": "Van Der Werf P.P.", "AuthorID": "7005314734", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}}}
