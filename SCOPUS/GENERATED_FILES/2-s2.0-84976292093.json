Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the liver safety and identify the characteristics of patients who developed a significant increase in transaminases whilst taking agomelatine. Method: A retrospective pooled analysis of changes in transaminase levels in 9234 patients treated with agomelatine (25 or 50 mg/day; n = 7605) or placebo (n = 1629) from 49 phase II and III studies was undertaken. A significant increase in transaminase levels was defined as an increase to >3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (>3 \u00d7 ULN). Final causality was determined in a case-by-case review by five academic experts. Results: Serum transaminases increased to >3 \u00d7 ULN in 1.3 and 2.5 % of patients treated with 25 and 50 mg of agomelatine, respectively, compared with 0.5 % for placebo. The onset of increased transaminases occurred before 12 weeks in 64 % of patients. The median time to recovery (to \u22642 \u00d7 ULN) was 14 days following treatment withdrawal. Liver function tests recovered in 36.1 % of patients despite continuation of agomelatine, suggesting the presence of a liver adaptive mechanism. No cases of acute liver failure or fatal outcome occurred. Patients with elevated transaminases at baseline, secondary to obesity/fatty liver disease, had an equally increased risk of developing further elevations of transaminases with agomelatine and placebo. Conclusion: Incidence of abnormal transaminases was low and dose dependent. No specific population was identified regarding potential risk factors. Withdrawal of agomelatine led to rapid recovery, and some patients exhibited an adaptive phenomenon. Overall, in clinical trials, the liver profile of agomelatine seems safe when serum transaminases are monitored.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetamides", "Adult", "Antidepressive Agents", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Liver Function Tests", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Transaminases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976292093", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6603820356": {"Name": "Perlemuter G.", "AuthorID": "6603820356", "AffiliationID": "60106289, 60106075", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U996, IPSIT, Labex Lermit"}, "7101824094": {"Name": "Cacoub P.", "AuthorID": "7101824094", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "7103393760": {"Name": "Valla D.", "AuthorID": "7103393760", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1149"}, "7005862152": {"Name": "Guyader D.", "AuthorID": "7005862152", "AffiliationID": "60030553, 60028893", "AffiliationName": "University of Rennes 1, CHU de Rennes"}, "57189992852": {"Name": "Saba B.", "AuthorID": "57189992852", "AffiliationID": "60017173", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier"}, "57189989225": {"Name": "Batailler C.", "AuthorID": "57189989225", "AffiliationID": "60017173", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier"}, "57212704015": {"Name": "Moore K.", "AuthorID": "57212704015", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}}}
