The availability of XNAs that do not interact with natural nucleic acids and are not affected by natural DNA processing enzymes, as well as specialized XNA processing enzymes that do not interact with natural nucleic acids, is essential. Here, we report 3\u2032-2\u2032 phosphonomethyl-threosyl nucleic acid (tPhoNA) as a novel XNA genetic material and a prime candidate for in vivo XNA applications. We established routes for the chemical synthesis of phosphonate nucleic acids and phosphorylated monomeric building blocks, and we demonstrated that DNA duplexes were destabilized upon replacement with tPhoNA. We engineered a novel tPhoNA synthetase enzyme and, with a previously reported XNA reverse transcriptase, demonstrated that tPhoNA is a viable genetic material (with an aggregate error rate of approximately 17 \u00d7 10-3 per base) compatible with the isolation of functional XNAs. In vivo experiments to test tPhoNA orthogonality showed that the E. coli cellular machinery had only very limited potential to access genetic information in tPhoNA. Our work is the first report of a synthetic genetic material modified in both sugar and phosphate backbone moieties and represents a significant advance in biorthogonality toward the introduction of XNA systems in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biorthogonality", "Building blockes", "Cellular machinery", "Genetic information", "Genetic materials", "In-vivo experiments", "Phosphate backbone", "Reverse transcriptases", "DNA", "Ligases", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Structure", "Organophosphonates", "Polymers", "Protein Engineering", "Xenobiotics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046655606", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57191831097": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57191831097", "AffiliationID": "60068577, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven"}, "7006175622": {"Name": "Rozenski J.", "AuthorID": "7006175622", "AffiliationID": "60068577, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven"}, "14821989700": {"Name": "Dumbre S.", "AuthorID": "14821989700", "AffiliationID": "60068577, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven"}, "57211470765": {"Name": "Groaz E.", "AuthorID": "57211470765", "AffiliationID": "60068577, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven"}, "56610834700": {"Name": "Herdewijn P.", "AuthorID": "56610834700", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106993, 60008134, 60106130", "AffiliationName": "ISSB, Genopole, CNRS, UEVE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "36552147400": {"Name": "Cozens C.", "AuthorID": "36552147400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57197458979": {"Name": "Mar\u00e9chal A.", "AuthorID": "57197458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "12774570400": {"Name": "Pinheiro V.B.", "AuthorID": "12774570400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57201982168": {"Name": "Jaziri F.", "AuthorID": "57201982168", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106993, 60008134, 60106130", "AffiliationName": "ISSB, Genopole, CNRS, UEVE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "6603287677": {"Name": "Pezo V.", "AuthorID": "6603287677", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106993, 60008134, 60106130", "AffiliationName": "ISSB, Genopole, CNRS, UEVE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "7004623721": {"Name": "Marli\u00e8re P.", "AuthorID": "7004623721", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106993, 60008134, 60106130", "AffiliationName": "ISSB, Genopole, CNRS, UEVE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}}}
