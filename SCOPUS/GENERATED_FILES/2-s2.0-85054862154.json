The European Standard recommends 0.03% BSA to test clean conditions and 0.3% for dirty conditions. Reactive oxygen species are known to exert excellent antimicrobial activity with low specificity against a broad range of pathogens. Herein, we present our data from the first study of the effects of the addition of BSA on the antibacterial activity of light activated antimicrobial surfaces. Light activated antimicrobial surfaces were made from polyurethane swell-encapsulated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the light active triarylmethane dye, crystal violet (PU-AuNP-CV). The antibacterial efficacy of the antimicrobial substrates was tested against two strains of Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4, a well-characterised laboratory strain and MRSA 4742, a recent clinical isolate, in the presence of 0.1% to 1% BSA by irradiating the substrates with a fluorescent lamp (300 lux). After 6 hours of irradiation, the number of surviving bacteria was determined. The results showed that BSA reduced the antibacterial efficacy of all the PU-AuNP-CV surfaces with increasing BSA concentrations resulting in a progressive reduction in antibacterial activity towards the bacteria tested. However, the light activated surfaces did perform well at 0.1 and 0.25% BSA levels, showing they may have potential for real world environments with low levels of organic soiling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-bacterial activity", "Anti-microbial activity", "Antibacterial efficacy", "Bovine serum albumins", "Interfering substances", "Light-activated antimicrobial", "Reactive oxygen species", "Real world environments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054862154", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57204178742": {"Name": "Louren\u00e7o C.", "AuthorID": "57204178742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56210619300": {"Name": "Macdonald T.", "AuthorID": "56210619300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Disease, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "Macrobert A.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}}}
