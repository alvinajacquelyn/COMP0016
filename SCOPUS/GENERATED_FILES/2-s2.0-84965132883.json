The presence of A\u03b2p is also one of the neuropathological hallmarks for the disease. AD final diagnosis is generally acknowledged after the evaluation of A\u03b2p deposition in the brain. Insoluble A\u03b2p accumulation may also concur to cause AD as postulated in the so-called amyloid hypothesis. Therefore, the visualization, evaluation and quantification of A\u03b2p are nowadays the keys for a better understanding of the disease, which may point to a possible cure for AD in the near future. Synchrotron-based X-ray phase contrast (XPC) has been demonstrated as the only imaging method that can retrieve the A\u03b2p signal with high spatial resolution (up to 10?\u03bcm), high sensitivity and three-dimensional information at the same time. Although at the moment XPC is suitable for ex vivo samples only, it may develop into an alternative to positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in A\u03b2p imaging. In this contribution the possibility of using synchrotron-based X-ray phase propagation computed tomography to visualize and measure A\u03b2p on mouse brains is presented. A careful setup optimization for this application leads to a significant improvement of spatial resolution (?1?\u03bcm), data acquisition speed (five times faster), X-ray dose (five times lower) and setup complexity, without a substantial loss in sensitivity when compared with the classic implementation of grating-based X-ray interferometry.Synchrotron-based X-ray phase propagation CT is used to visualize and measure amyloid beta accumulation in mouse brains. This technique improves the resolution, the acquisition speed and the X-ray dose if compared with previous methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid plaques", "brain imaging", "phase contrast", "X-ray CT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid plaques", "Brain imaging", "Phase contrasts", "X-ray CT", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Brain", "Mice", "Peptide Fragments", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965132883", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "TOMCAT Beamline, Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute"}, "54909987700": {"Name": "Stampanoni M.", "AuthorID": "54909987700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University and ETH Zurich"}, "14321840000": {"Name": "Lathuili\u00e8re A.", "AuthorID": "14321840000", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "57189097409": {"Name": "Laversenne V.", "AuthorID": "57189097409", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "7402402024": {"Name": "Schneider B.", "AuthorID": "7402402024", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Studies Laboratory, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}}}
