Abraham model solute descriptors for 3-methyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid are calculated by combining the solubility measured in this study with recently published solubility data for the carboxylic acid solute dissolved in acetone, acetonitrile, and N,N-dimethylformamide. The calculated solute descriptors were found to describe the experimental solubility data to within an overall average standard error of 0.081 log units.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3-methyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid solubilities", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "organic solvents", "solute descriptors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham solvation parameter model", "Acid solubility", "Diisopropyl ether", "Experimental solubility datum", "N ,N-Dimethylformamide", "Solute descriptors", "Spectroscopic method", "Tetra-hydrofuran"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986203541", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "14319075500": {"Name": "Bowen K.", "AuthorID": "14319075500", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57190491364": {"Name": "Horton M.", "AuthorID": "57190491364", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
