Pneumococcal, tetanus and influenza vaccinations are recommended for patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) when treated with immunosuppressive medication. The aim of this publication is to report the safety of pneumococcal and other vaccinations in CAPS patients. Methods. All CAPS patients followed in the \u03b2-CONFIDENT (Clinical Outcomes and Safety Registry study of Ilaris patients) registry were analysed if they had received a vaccination. The \u03b2-CONFIDENT registry is a global, long-term, prospective, observational registry, capturing and monitoring patients treated with canakinumab. Results. Sixty-eight CAPS patients had received a total of 159 vaccine injections, 107 injections against influenza, 19 pneumococcal vaccinations, 12 against tetanus/diphtheria antigens and 21 other vaccinations. Fourteen per cent of injections had elicited at least one vaccine reaction. All five vaccine-related serious adverse events were associated with pneumococcal vaccination. Vaccine reactions were observed in 70% of pneumococcal vaccinations, compared with 7% in influenza and 17% in tetanus/ diphtheria vaccinations. The odds ratios to react to the pneumococcal vaccines compared with influenza and tetanus/diphtheria vaccines were 31.0 (95% CI: 8, 119) and 10.8 (95% CI: 2, 74). Vaccine reactions after pneumococcal vaccinations were more severe and lasted significantly longer (up to 3 weeks) compared with other vaccinations. In two patients, pneumococcal vaccination also elicited symptoms consistent with systemic inflammation due to CAPS reactivation. Conclusion. Pneumococcal vaccines, unlike other vaccines, frequently trigger severe local and systemic inflammation in CAPS patients. Clinicians must balance potential benefits of pneumococcal immunization against safety concerns. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine might be favourable over the polysaccharide vaccine in CAPS patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAPS", "Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes", "Safety", "Vaccinations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes", "Diphtheria-Tetanus Vaccine", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Influenza Vaccines", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Opportunistic Infections", "Pneumococcal Vaccines", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Safety", "Vaccination", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025102410", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56201755200": {"Name": "Jaeger V.K.", "AuthorID": "56201755200", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7003907112": {"Name": "Walker U.A.", "AuthorID": "7003907112", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7201677513": {"Name": "Hoffman H.M.", "AuthorID": "7201677513", "AffiliationID": "60002645", "AffiliationName": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Rady Children's Hospital"}, "7101676266": {"Name": "van der Poll T.", "AuthorID": "7101676266", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Center of Experimental and Molecular Medicine Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "55700976400": {"Name": "Tilson H.", "AuthorID": "55700976400", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina"}, "57195949195": {"Name": "Seibert J.", "AuthorID": "57195949195", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "56120978900": {"Name": "Speziale A.", "AuthorID": "56120978900", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "6602717058": {"Name": "Junge G.", "AuthorID": "6602717058", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "56568377900": {"Name": "Vritzali E.", "AuthorID": "56568377900", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "57192872472": {"Name": "Franke K.", "AuthorID": "57192872472", "AffiliationID": "60112142", "AffiliationName": "QuintilesIMS, Real World Insights"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "7801480375": {"Name": "Kuemmerle-Deschner J.", "AuthorID": "7801480375", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Tuebingen"}}}
