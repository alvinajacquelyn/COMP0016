Method: Sixty-two audiologist\u2013patient dyads participated. Patient participants were aged 55 years or older. Hearing assessment appointments were audiovisually recorded and transcribed for analysis. Audiologists\u2019 language was profiled using two measures: general language complexity and use of jargon. A binomial, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between these language measures and hearing aid uptake. Results: The logistic regression model revealed that the Flesch\u2013Kincaid reading grade level of audiologists\u2019 language was significantly associated with hearing aid uptake. Patients were less likely to obtain hearing aids when audiologists\u2019 language was at a higher reading grade level. No associations were found between audiologists\u2019 use of jargon and hearing aid uptake. Conclusions: Audiologists\u2019 use of complex language may present a barrier for patients to understand hearing rehabilitation recommendations. Reduced understanding may limit patient participation in the decision-making process and result in patients being less willing to trial hearing aids. Clear, concise language is recommended to facilitate shared decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Audiologists", "Cohort Studies", "Communication", "Comprehension", "Decision Making", "Female", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Loss", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Language", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Prospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020538370", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57194525365": {"Name": "Sciacca A.", "AuthorID": "57194525365", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "114838314", "AffiliationName": "The HEARing CRC"}, "55641225100": {"Name": "Ekberg K.", "AuthorID": "55641225100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland"}, "7004043266": {"Name": "Hickson L.", "AuthorID": "7004043266", "AffiliationID": "114838314", "AffiliationName": "The HEARing CRC"}, "56039137700": {"Name": "Barr C.", "AuthorID": "56039137700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, The University of Melbourne"}}}
