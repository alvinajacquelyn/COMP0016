The chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and ranaviruses have extraordinarily broad host ranges, however co-infection dynamics have been largely overlooked. We investigated the pattern of co-occurrence of these two pathogens in an amphibian assemblage in Serra da Estrela (Portugal). The detection of chytridiomycosis in Portugal was linked to population declines of midwife-toads (Alytes obstetricans). The asynchronous and subsequent emergence of a second pathogen - ranavirus - caused episodes of lethal ranavirosis. Chytrid effects were limited to high altitudes and a single host, while ranavirus was highly pathogenic across multiple hosts, life-stages and altitudinal range. This new strain (Portuguese newt and toad ranavirus - member of the CMTV clade) caused annual mass die-offs, similar in host range and rapidity of declines to other locations in Iberia affected by CMTV-like ranaviruses. However, ranavirus was not always associated with disease, mortality and declines, contrasting with previous reports on Iberian CMTV-like ranavirosis. We found little evidence that pre-existing chytrid emergence was associated with ranavirus and the emergence of ranavirosis. Despite the lack of cumulative or amplified effects, ranavirus drove declines of host assemblages and changed host community composition and structure, posing a grave threat to all amphibian populations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Altitude", "Animals", "Anura", "Chytridiomycota", "Coinfection", "DNA Virus Infections", "Life Cycle Stages", "Mycoses", "Portugal", "Prevalence", "Ranavirus", "Salamandridae", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014076209", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57210846772": {"Name": "Rosa G.M.", "AuthorID": "57210846772", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "55227062300": {"Name": "Griffiths R.A.", "AuthorID": "55227062300", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "56432110300": {"Name": "Price S.J.", "AuthorID": "56432110300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute"}, "7005973727": {"Name": "Garner T.W.J.", "AuthorID": "7005973727", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "13907587200": {"Name": "Rebelo R.", "AuthorID": "13907587200", "AffiliationID": "60002769", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes (CE3C), Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "56022523500": {"Name": "Sabino-Pinto J.", "AuthorID": "56022523500", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Division of Evolutionary Biology, Zoological Institute"}, "55010251400": {"Name": "Laurentino T.G.", "AuthorID": "55010251400", "AffiliationID": "60044069, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Institute, University of Basel"}, "7102242164": {"Name": "Martel A.", "AuthorID": "7102242164", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Avian Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University"}, "7003936223": {"Name": "Pasmans F.", "AuthorID": "7003936223", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Avian Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University"}, "55626752800": {"Name": "St\u00f6hr A.C.", "AuthorID": "55626752800", "AffiliationID": "60018373", "AffiliationName": "Fachgebiet f\u00fcr Umwelt- und Tierhygiene, Universitat Hohenheim"}, "6603624720": {"Name": "Marschang R.E.", "AuthorID": "6603624720", "AffiliationID": "60113803", "AffiliationName": "Laboklin GmbH and Co.
