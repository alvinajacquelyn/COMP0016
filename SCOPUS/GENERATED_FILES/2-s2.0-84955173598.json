There have been few direct experimental tests of this hypothesis. Aims: The aim of the study was to test the immediate effects of manipulating self-esteem in individuals vulnerable to paranoia. Method: A two condition cross-over experimental test was conducted. The participants were 26 males reporting paranoid ideation in the past month. Each participant experienced a neutral immersive virtual reality (VR) social environment twice. Before VR participants received a low self-confidence manipulation or a high self-confidence manipulation. The order of manipulation type was randomized. Paranoia about the VR avatars was assessed. Results: The low self-confidence manipulation, relative to the high self-confidence manipulation, led to significantly more negative social comparison in virtual reality and higher levels of paranoia. Conclusions: Level of self-confidence affects the occurrence of paranoia in vulnerable individuals. The clinical implication is that interventions designed to improve self-confidence may reduce persecutory ideation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delusions", "persecutory delusions", "self-esteem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Delusions", "Emotions", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Paranoid Disorders", "Self Concept", "Social Behavior", "Social Environment", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955173598", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56411750700": {"Name": "Atherton S.", "AuthorID": "56411750700", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford Cognitive Approaches to Psychosis, Warneford Hospital"}, "57197538198": {"Name": "Evans N.", "AuthorID": "57197538198", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford Cognitive Approaches to Psychosis, Warneford Hospital"}, "55894916400": {"Name": "Cernis E.", "AuthorID": "55894916400", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford Cognitive Approaches to Psychosis, Warneford Hospital"}, "55048989300": {"Name": "Lister R.", "AuthorID": "55048989300", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford Cognitive Approaches to Psychosis, Warneford Hospital"}, "57202665457": {"Name": "Freeman D.", "AuthorID": "57202665457", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford Cognitive Approaches to Psychosis, Warneford Hospital"}, "15059870100": {"Name": "Antley A.", "AuthorID": "15059870100", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60116889", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202885944": {"Name": "Dunn G.", "AuthorID": "7202885944", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, NW Hub for Trials Methodology Research"}, "7202932472": {"Name": "Slater M.", "AuthorID": "7202932472", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "University of Barcelona"}}}
