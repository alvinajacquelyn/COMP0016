Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Lahiri (2002) classifies question embedding predicates into two major types, rogative and responsive predicates. Rogative predicates like wonder are only compatible with interrogative complements, while responsive predicates like know are also compatible with declarative complements. There are two main theories of responsive predicates: The question-to-proposition reduction approach holds that responsive predicates semantically always select for propositions and that both declarative and interrogative complements to them denote propositions (Heim 1994; Dayal 1996; Lahiri 2002; Spector & Egr\u00e9 2015). The proposition-to-question reduction approach (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984; Theiler et al. 2015; Uegaki 2015) assumes that responsive predicates semantically always select for question denotations and declarative complements denote resolved questions. We argue that Predicates of Relevance (PoRs) favour the latter approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029385903", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57195624284": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "57195624284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56617822400": {"Name": "Klinedinst N.", "AuthorID": "56617822400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56255207300": {"Name": "Sudo Y.", "AuthorID": "56255207300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507536709": {"Name": "Uegaki W.", "AuthorID": "6507536709", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Centre for Linguistics/Leiden University Institute for Area Studies"}}}
