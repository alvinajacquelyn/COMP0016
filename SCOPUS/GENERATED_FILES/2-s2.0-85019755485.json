Green Deal is the most recent UK policy and it intends to promote the energy efficient refurbishment of existing dwellings. This study explores potential packages through Green Deal for five different dwelling types. The proposed packages include: the use of insulation, glazing and renewable energy technologies. This paper proposes three potential packages for each dwelling type, which would have the ability to offer the maximum amount of CO2 savings. A model has been developed in order to evaluate the recommended packages. It seems that the package of: internal, cavity, floor, roof/loft, doors insulation and micro turbine could offer the most significant CO2 reduction in detached dwellings, while the package of: external, cavity, floor, roof/loft, doors insulation and a wind turbine could offer the lowest amount of CO2 savings in terraced dwellings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buildings", "Energy modeling", "Green Deal", "Renewables", "Technologies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy efficient", "Energy model", "Green Deal", "Micro turbine", "Renewable energy technologies", "Renewable technology", "Renewables", "Traditional buildings"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019755485", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57194326584": {"Name": "Moschou C.", "AuthorID": "57194326584", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environment and Geomatic Engineering, UCL"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, UCL, Central House"}}}
