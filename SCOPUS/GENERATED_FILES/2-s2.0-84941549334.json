No hospital will encounter many such twins and the opportunity to develop expertise is limited. We have dealt with 2 such sets and illustrate our approach by reference to our most recent set. We believe that detailed imaging allows precise delineation of the anatomy and facilitates detailed planning of the surgery. When venous drainage from the 2 brains is connected, we believe that staged separation is preferable as gradual alteration of hemodynamics may be safer than a single-stage procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conjoined twins", "Craniopagus", "Staged separation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Craniofacial Abnormalities", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Twins, Conjoined"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941549334", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55401970300": {"Name": "Jeelani N.U.O.", "AuthorID": "55401970300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
