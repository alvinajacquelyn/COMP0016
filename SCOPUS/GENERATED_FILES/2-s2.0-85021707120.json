However, attributions of harmful intent have been poorly studied and mainly using artificial scenarios rather than participation in genuine social interactions where genuine resources are at stake. Using a large non-clinical population (N = 3229) recruited online, we asked people to complete a measure of paranoid ideation before playing a modified Dictator Game, where the 'dictator' can allocate money to the partner (the 'receiver'). Participants were allocated to the role of receiver or of an uninvolved observer; and evaluated to what extent they believed dictator decisions were motivated by (i) self-interest or (ii) harmful intent. All participants attributed more harmful intent to unfair as opposed to fair dictators. Paranoia had a positive effect on harmful intent attribution, for both fair and unfair dictators. Paranoia did not interact with attributions of self-interest. Importantly, highly paranoid participants attributed equally strong harmful intent to the dictator in the observer role as in the receiver role. This challenges the assumption that paranoia is mainly due to an exaggerated sense of personalised threat and suggests instead that paranoia involves a negative social representations of others.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Game Theory", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Paranoid Disorders", "Social Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021707120", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22954006700": {"Name": "Raihani N.", "AuthorID": "22954006700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7007065687": {"Name": "Bell V.", "AuthorID": "7007065687", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
