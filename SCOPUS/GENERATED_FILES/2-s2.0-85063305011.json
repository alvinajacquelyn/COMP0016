This is useful in minimally invasive robotic surgery, where the motion of a laparoscopic camera is constrained by the keyhole insertion point. Our method uses point correspondences between the two images and does not require any knowledge about the position of the remote center of motion. The pipeline consists of a 4-point minimal closed-form solver, used within a robust RANSAC framework to filter outlier correspondences, followed by a Levenberg-Marquardt refinement step. Our method compares favorably against the classic relative pose solution for unconstrained motion (5-point algorithm) both with synthetic data and a real footage of endoscopic robotic surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Surgical robotics: laparoscopy", "visual-based navigation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Da vinci surgical robots", "Image correspondence", "Point correspondence", "Pose estimation", "Remote center of motions", "Robot vision systems", "Surgical robotics", "Synthetic and real data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063305011", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"47862298300": {"Name": "Vasconcelos F.", "AuthorID": "47862298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London"}, "57207943077": {"Name": "Mazomentos E.", "AuthorID": "57207943077", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University of College London"}}}
