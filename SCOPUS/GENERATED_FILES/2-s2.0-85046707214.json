A crucial move is needed to bridge the gap between appropriate assessment tools and local hypertensive patients\u2019 medication adherence. Objective: To produce a translated version in Malay language of Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) that was \u201cconceptually equivalent\u201d to the original English version for use in local clinical practice and research. Methods: The forward translation process was conducted by two independent professional translators and back translation was done by two other independent translators. A reliability analysis was conducted on 238 conveniently selected hypertensive patients. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess test-retest reliability for the randomly selected 40 patients in a period of 2 weeks. Discriminant validity was tested through Necessity-Concerns differential, BMQ subscales, and other parameters. Results: The overall Cronbach alpha for the internal consistency was good (0.860). The subscales of the BMQ demonstrated adequate internal consistency, with Cronbach alpha value of 0.759 for Specific-Necessity, 0.762 for Specific Concern, 0.624 for General-Overuse, and 0.756 for General-Harm. The ICC was excellent (0.922). Discriminant validity revealed that BMQ Specific-Necessity score was significantly inversely correlated with the systolic blood pressure level. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (P = 0.038; P = 0.05) were reported to be significantly correlated with the Necessity-Concerns differential, with Necessity score equal or exceeding Concerns score. Conclusions: The Malay-translated version of BMQ is a reliable and valid tool to assess patient belief about medication, especially medication adherence among the hypertensive patients in Malaysia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)", "hypertension", "medication adherence", "validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cultural Competency", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Linguistics", "Malaysia", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Translations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046707214", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"56893025800": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "56893025800", "AffiliationID": "120299134", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, KPJ International College"}, "9741079900": {"Name": "Hassali M.", "AuthorID": "9741079900", "AffiliationID": "60000906", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia"}, "35269375100": {"Name": "Neoh C.", "AuthorID": "35269375100", "AffiliationID": "60004351", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Teknologi MARA Shah Alam"}, "36697144800": {"Name": "Saleem F.", "AuthorID": "36697144800", "AffiliationID": "60066596", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, University of Balochistan"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, Centre for Behavioural Medicine, University College London"}}}
