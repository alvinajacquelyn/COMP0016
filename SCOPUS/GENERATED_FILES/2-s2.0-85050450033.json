Over the past decade epigenetics has rapidly expanded into an enormous field of inquiry that includes stem cell biology, cancer biology, investigations into genome instability and DNA repair. Following a general introduction, discussion in this chapter is confined to the vibrant sub-field known as behavioral epigenetics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050450033", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7101916603": {"Name": "Lock M.", "AuthorID": "7101916603", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Department of Social Studies of Medicine, McGill University"}}}
