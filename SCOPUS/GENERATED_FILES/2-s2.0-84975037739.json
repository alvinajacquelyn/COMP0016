Within the next 10 years it is expected to become the leading cause of liver pathology, liver failure and indication for liver transplantation in childhood and adolescence in theWestern world. While our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease remains limited, it is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of more widespread metabolic dysfunction and is strongly associated with a number of metabolic risk factors, including insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease and, most significantly, obesity. Despite this, \u201dpaediatric\u201d NAFLD remains under-studied, under-recognised and, potentially, undermanaged. This article will explore and evaluate our current understanding of NAFLD in childhood and adolescence and how it differs from adult NAFLD, in terms of its epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis and clinical management. Given the current absence of definitive radiological and histopathological diagnostic tests, maintenance of a high clinical suspicion by all members of the multidisciplinary team in primary and specialist care settings remains the most potent of diagnostic tools, enabling early diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Children", "NAFLD", "Obesity", "Steatosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Child", "Disease Management", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975037739", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"7103101023": {"Name": "Temple J.L.", "AuthorID": "7103101023", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "23492108400": {"Name": "Cordero P.", "AuthorID": "23492108400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "56879862800": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "56879862800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "56978643100": {"Name": "Nguyen V.", "AuthorID": "56978643100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "6602606185": {"Name": "Oben J.A.", "AuthorID": "6602606185", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
