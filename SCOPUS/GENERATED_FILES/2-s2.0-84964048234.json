These are observed as administrative regional delimitations which are the outcome of complex geographical, political and historical processes which leave almost indelible footprints on infrastructure such as the street network. In this work, we uncover a set of hierarchies in Britain at different scales using percolation theory on the street network and on its intersections which are the primary points of interaction and urban agglomeration. At the larger scales, the observed hierarchical structures can be interpreted as regional fractures of Britain, observed in various forms, from natural boundaries, such as National Parks, to regional divisions based on social class and wealth such as the well-known North\u2013 South divide. At smaller scales, cities are generated through recursive percolations on each of the emerging regional clusters. We examine the evolution of the morphology of the system as a whole, by measuring the fractal dimension of the clusters at each distance threshold in the percolation. We observe that this reaches a maximum plateau at a specific distance. The clusters defined at this distance threshold are in excellent correspondence with the boundaries of cities recovered from satellite images, and from previous methods using population density.", "AuthorKeywords": ["City boundaries", "Fractal dimension", "Percolation theory", "Street networks", "Urban hierarchies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964048234", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24066273900": {"Name": "Arcaute E.", "AuthorID": "24066273900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}, "57132716300": {"Name": "Molinero C.", "AuthorID": "57132716300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}, "7801398143": {"Name": "Hatna E.", "AuthorID": "7801398143", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Modeling, The Johns Hopkins University"}, "56013716500": {"Name": "Murcio R.", "AuthorID": "56013716500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175902", "AffiliationName": "Consumer Research Data Centre, Geography, University College London"}, "57188873459": {"Name": "Vargas-Ruiz C.", "AuthorID": "57188873459", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175902", "AffiliationName": "Consumer Research Data Centre, Geography, University College London"}, "15725393300": {"Name": "Masucci A.P.", "AuthorID": "15725393300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}, "7005713858": {"Name": "Batty M.", "AuthorID": "7005713858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}}}
