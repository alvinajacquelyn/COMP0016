It was found that the positional deviation of the solder beads increases with the increase of the trap size. To clarify the underlying mechanism, simulations based on the integration of the Maxwell stress tensor were used to study the force profiles of OET traps with different sizes. It was found that the solder beads felt a 0.1 nN static friction or stiction force due to electrical forces pulling them towards the surface and that this force is not dependent on the size of the trap. The stiction limits the positioning accuracy; however, we show that by choosing a trap that is just larger than the solder bead sub-micron positional accuracy can be achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical force", "Light-induced dielectrophoresis", "Maxwell stress tensors", "Optoelectronic tweezers", "Positional accuracy", "Positioning accuracy", "Static friction", "Stiction forces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000752103", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55265026600": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "55265026600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "57192201516": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192201516", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "36236986800": {"Name": "Juvert J.", "AuthorID": "36236986800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Research Group, Center for Nano- and Biophotonics (NB-Photonics), INTEC-department, Ghent University-IMEC"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "57202682639": {"Name": "Neale S.", "AuthorID": "57202682639", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55520861900": {"Name": "Tian P.", "AuthorID": "55520861900", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Electric Light Sources, Fudan University"}, "57192196618": {"Name": "Navarro J.", "AuthorID": "57192196618", "AffiliationID": "114589932", "AffiliationName": "IPS"}}}
