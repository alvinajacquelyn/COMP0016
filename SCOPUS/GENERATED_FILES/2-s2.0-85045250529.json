Developmental Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The mature visual system condenses complex scenes into simple summary statistics (e.g., average size, location, orientation, etc.). However, children, often perform poorly on perceptual averaging tasks. Children's difficulties are typically thought to represent the suboptimal implementation of an adult-like strategy. This paper examines another possibility: that children actually make decisions in a qualitatively different way to adults (optimal implementation of a non-ideal strategy). Ninety children (6\u20137, 8\u20139, 10\u201311 years) and 30 adults were asked to locate the middle of randomly generated dot-clouds. Nine plausible decision strategies were formulated, and each was fitted to observers' trial-by-trial response data (Reverse Correlation). When the number of visual elements was low (N < 6), children used a qualitatively different decision strategy from adults: appearing to \u201cjoin up the dots\u201d and locate the gravitational center of the enclosing shape. Given denser displays, both children and adults used an ideal strategy of arithmetically averaging individual points. Accounting for this difference in decision strategy explained 29% of children's lower precision. These findings suggest that children are not simply suboptimal at performing adult-like computations, but may at times use sensible, but qualitatively different strategies to make perceptual judgments. Learning which strategy is best in which circumstance might be an important driving factor of perceptual development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Learning", "Orientation", "Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045250529", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.R.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "36666127500": {"Name": "Dekker T.M.", "AuthorID": "36666127500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}}}
