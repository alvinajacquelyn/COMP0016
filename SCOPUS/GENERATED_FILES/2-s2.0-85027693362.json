Firstly, we will discuss the typical clinical features of PD and its underlying pathology and aetiology. We will then explore the possible differential diagnoses in relation to age at onset, encompassing juvenile/early-onset PD, PD in mid life and PD in the elderly. We will outline the typical features of each differential and useful investigations, which will help to reach the correct diagnosis. Finally, we will provide a practical guide of how to approach a parkinsonian patient in a clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dementia with lewy body", "Essential tremor", "Multiple system atrophy", "Progressive supranuclear palsy", "Progressive supranuclear palsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027693362", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55347741900": {"Name": "Magdalinou N.", "AuthorID": "55347741900", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square Brain Bank"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Upper 3rd Floor, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
