Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are being increasingly applied in infants and preschool children too, albeit only in specialised centres. PFTs, when performed and interpreted accurately, provide objective outcome measures which can be used clinically to guide management, for prognostic purposes and in epidemiological research studies. They can be used to determine the nature and severity of lung disease, to ascertain response to treatment and to monitor disease progression. PFTs are rarely diagnostic in their own right with the exception of asthma, but are valuable adjuncts and before clinicians select a PFT they must know what the results are likely to be in the disease being considered. Spirometry and tests of airway calibre and function are the most widely used PFTs, as diseases in children commonly affect airway function. As such, spirometry should be a standard part of the assessment of school-age children who present to the pediatrician with chronic respiratory symptoms. This review will provide a bird\u2019s eye view of currently available PFTs in children to assist in the diagnosis and management of respiratory disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Pulmonary function", "Spirometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Diseases", "Respiratory Function Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937969027", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"6505461405": {"Name": "Sonnappa S.", "AuthorID": "6505461405", "AffiliationID": "115418523", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Rainbow Children\u2019s Hospital, Marathahalli"}}}
