Whether there are ways to predict, and ultimately enhance, parental caregiving quality during the prenatal stages of development has been less well understood. This circumstance is even truer when things do not go according \u201cto plan.\u201d In this commentary, we explore two possible scenarios, perhaps unexpected for expectant parents, that can affect children\u2019s development: (1) postpartum parental displays of atypical behaviors and parental caregiving strategies (i.e., maternal/paternal depression) and (2) postpartum child displays of atypical behaviors (i.e., autism spectrum disorder).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060994564", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"42361720000": {"Name": "Wong K.K.Y.", "AuthorID": "42361720000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203775204": {"Name": "Esposito G.", "AuthorID": "57203775204", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
