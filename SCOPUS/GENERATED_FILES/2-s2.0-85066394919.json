Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: The Base of the Pyramid (BoP) project is a public\u2013private partnership initiated by Novo Nordisk that aims to facilitate access to diabetes care for people at the base of the economic pyramid in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Kenya, the BoP, through a partnership model, aims to strengthen five pillars of diabetes care: increased awareness of diabetes; early diagnosis of diabetes; access to quality care by trained professionals; stable and affordable insulin supply; and improved self-management through patient education. Objectives: This study evaluates the extent to which BoP Kenya is scalable and sustainable, whether stakeholders share in its value, and whether BoP Kenya has improved access to diabetes care. Method: The Rapid Assessment Protocol for Insulin Access (RAPIA), an approach developed to provide a broad situational analysis of diabetes care, was used to examine health infrastructure and diabetes care pathways in Kenya. At the national level, the RAPIA was applied in a SWOT analysis of the BoP through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. At individual and county health system levels, RAPIA was adapted to explore the impact of the BoP on access to diabetes care through a comparison of an intervention and control county. Results: The BoP was implemented in 28 of 47 counties in Kenya. Meru, a county where BoP was implemented, had 35 of 62 facilities (56%) participating in the BoP. Of the five pillars of the BoP, most notable progress was made in achieving the fourth (stable and affordable insulin supply). A price ceiling of 500KSh (US$5) per vial of insulin was established in the intervention county, with greater fluctuation and stock-outs in the non-intervention county. Despite reduced insulin costs, many patients with diabetes could not afford the additive expenses of monitoring, medicines, and travel. Less progress was made over the other pillars, which also faced challenges to sustainability and scalability. Conclusion: In the context of the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases in LMICs, cross-sector approaches to improving access to care are increasingly needed. Public\u2013private partnerships such as the BoP are necessary but not sufficient to ensure access to health care for people with diabetes at the base of the economic pyramid in Kenya.", "AuthorKeywords": ["access", "Diabetes", "health systems", "insulin", "service delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Kenya", "Poverty", "Public-Private Sector Partnerships", "Quality of Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066394919", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37066519500": {"Name": "Shannon G.", "AuthorID": "37066519500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Economics, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "36647510000": {"Name": "Haghparast-Bidgoli H.", "AuthorID": "36647510000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Economics, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "26654536200": {"Name": "Skordis-Worrall J.", "AuthorID": "26654536200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Economics, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57209046148": {"Name": "Chelagat W.", "AuthorID": "57209046148", "AffiliationID": "60015157", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Environment Institute Africa"}, "56685908000": {"Name": "Kibachio J.", "AuthorID": "56685908000", "AffiliationID": "60054337", "AffiliationName": "Kenyan Ministry of Health"}}}
