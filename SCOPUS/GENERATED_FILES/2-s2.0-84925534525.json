There are, however, few descriptions in the literature of the content of successful physiotherapy treatment. This prospective cohort study reports the practicalities and outcomes of a pilot 5-day physiotherapy programme. Patients were referred from a specialist movement disorders clinic. The treatment consisted of education and movement retraining, with a long-term self-management focus. Education and movement retraining was based on a pathophysiological model for FMD that stresses the importance of self-focussed attention and illness belief. Patients were assessed at baseline, end of treatment and 3-month follow-up. 47 patients completed the programme, mean symptom duration was 5.5 years, 64 % were unemployed due to ill health. At the end of treatment, 65 % rated their symptoms as \u201cvery much improved\u201d or \u201cmuch improved\u201d, this reduced to 55 % at 3 months. At follow-up, there was a significant improvement in physical domains of the SF-36, Berg Balance Scale and 10 Metre Timed Walk. Measures of mental health did not change. This prospective cohort study adds to the growing evidence that supports the use of specialist physiotherapy treatment for FMD. Improvements here were made despite the cohort having characteristics associated with poor prognosis. We argue that specific treatment techniques are important and have the potential to improve physical function, quality of life and may prove to be a cost-effective treatment for selected patients with FMD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Functional", "Physiotherapy", "Psychogenic", "Rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Analysis of Variance", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement Disorders", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Pilot Projects", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925534525", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55177816300": {"Name": "Nielsen G.", "AuthorID": "55177816300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Therapy Services Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36167347400": {"Name": "Ricciardi L.", "AuthorID": "36167347400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006398244": {"Name": "Joyce E.", "AuthorID": "7006398244", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.J.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36439073200": {"Name": "Demartini B.", "AuthorID": "36439073200", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60016182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, San Paolo Hospital and University of Milan"}, "55541432300": {"Name": "Hunter R.", "AuthorID": "55541432300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL"}}}
