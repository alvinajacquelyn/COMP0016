Genetic mutations resulting in quantitative defects in the CTLA4 pathway are also associated with the development of immune dysregulation syndromes in humans. It has been proposed that CTLA4 functions to remove its ligands CD80 and CD86 from opposing cells by a process known as transendocytosis. A quantitative characterization of CTLA4 synthesis, endocytosis, degradation, and recycling and how these affect its function is currently lacking. In a combined in vitro and in silico study, we developed a mathematical model and identified these trafficking parameters. Our model predicts optimal ligand removal in an intermediate affinity range. The intracellular CTLA4 pool as well as fast internalization, recovery of free CTLA4 from internalized complexes, and recycling is critical for sustained functionality. CD80-CTLA4 interactions are predicted to dominate over CD86-CTLA4. Implications of these findings in the context of control of antigen-presenting cells by regulatory T cells and of pathologic genetic deficiencies are discussed. The presented mathematical model can be reused in the community beyond these questions to better understand other trafficking receptors and study the impact of CTLA4 targeting drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "B7-1 Antigen", "B7-2 Antigen", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "CTLA-4 Antigen", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Kinetics", "Ligands", "Models, Biological", "Protein Binding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053152692", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"]], "AuthorData": {"36632384600": {"Name": "Khailaie S.", "AuthorID": "36632384600", "AffiliationID": "118617364", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine"}, "56265915500": {"Name": "Robert P.A.", "AuthorID": "56265915500", "AffiliationID": "60012279, 60007902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"}, "57203841778": {"Name": "Badillo Herrera J.D.", "AuthorID": "57203841778", "AffiliationID": "60012279, 60007902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"}, "6602091186": {"Name": "Meyer-Hermann M.", "AuthorID": "6602091186", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "35230701100": {"Name": "Rowshanravan B.", "AuthorID": "35230701100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57203844063": {"Name": "Waters E.", "AuthorID": "57203844063", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55786156000": {"Name": "Halliday N.", "AuthorID": "55786156000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7402359366": {"Name": "Walker L.S.K.", "AuthorID": "7402359366", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005289543": {"Name": "Sansom D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005289543", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
