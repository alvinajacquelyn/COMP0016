First, the fibre refractive-index profile is optimized for low differential mode delay and low macro-bend losses. Afterwards, we present a semi-analytical model of the linear mode coupling induced by fibre imperfections and stress. Finally, the interplay between the linear mode coupling and the differential mode delay is studied numerically and analytically, allowing to quantify the receiver memory required for a given fibre span.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differential Mode Delay", "Few-Mode Fibres", "Linear Mode Coupling", "Mode-Division Multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Differential Mode Delays", "Fibre designs", "Linear modes", "Macro-bend loss", "Mode-division multiplexing", "Refractive index profiles", "Semi-analytical model"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043454787", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"34881593800": {"Name": "Ferreira F.", "AuthorID": "34881593800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}, "57191035971": {"Name": "Costa C.", "AuthorID": "57191035971", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}, "55372527400": {"Name": "Sygletos S.", "AuthorID": "55372527400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}, "7201547136": {"Name": "Ellis A.", "AuthorID": "7201547136", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}}}
