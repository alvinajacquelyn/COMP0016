However, considerably less is known about the relationship between student\u2019s metacognition related to non-cognitive dimensions, such as their affect or lifestyles, and academic performance. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of data gathered by Performance Learning Education (PL), with respect to students\u2019 self-reports on non-cognitive dimensions as possible predictors of their academic outcomes. The results point to the predictive potential of such self-reports, to the importance of students exercising their self-understanding during learning, and to the potentially critical role of incorporating such student\u2019s self-reports in learner modelling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Academic performance", "Cognitive dimensions", "Cognitive task", "Learning outcome", "Metacognition", "Metacognitives", "Preliminary analysis", "Self reports"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049361164", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"7801505406": {"Name": "Porayska-Pomsta K.", "AuthorID": "7801505406", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "56904209900": {"Name": "Cukurova M.", "AuthorID": "56904209900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "39561382000": {"Name": "Margeti M.", "AuthorID": "39561382000", "AffiliationID": "118787827", "AffiliationName": "Performance Learning Education Ltd."}, "57194786000": {"Name": "Samani T.", "AuthorID": "57194786000", "AffiliationID": "118787827", "AffiliationName": "Performance Learning Education Ltd."}}}
