Following I2++CO collisions, we detect I++CO+ from a single-electron transfer reaction and IO++C+ from bond-forming reactivity. Reaction-window calculations, based on Landau-Zener theory, have been used to rationalise the electron transfer reactivity and computational chemistry has been used to explore the [I-CO]2+ potential energy surface to account for the observation of IO+. In addition, collisions between I2+ and CS2 have been investigated over a range of centre-of-mass collision energies between 0.8 and 6.0 eV. Both single- and double-electron transfer reactions are observed in the I2+/CS2 collision system, an observation again rationalised by reaction-window theory. The monocations IS+ and IC+ are also detected following collisions of I2+ with CS2 and these ions are clearly products from a bond-forming reaction. We present a simple model based on the structure of the [I-CS2]2+ collision complex to rationalise the significantly larger yield of IS+ than IC+ in this bond-forming process.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bond-forming reactions", "Collision energies", "Collision systems", "Electron transfer reactivity", "Electron-transfer reactions", "Landau-Zener theory", "Single electron transfer", "Time of flight mass spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941260824", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7402936983": {"Name": "Fletcher J.D.", "AuthorID": "7402936983", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8839107300": {"Name": "Parkes M.A.", "AuthorID": "8839107300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202475351": {"Name": "Price S.D.", "AuthorID": "7202475351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
