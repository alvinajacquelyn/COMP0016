Previous studies have made efforts to evaluate direct GHG emissions of nations (a.k.a. production-based accounting method) and GHG emissions caused by the final consumption of nations (a.k.a. consumption-based accounting method), but overlooked downstream GHG emissions enabled by primary inputs of individual nations and sectors (a.k.a. income-based accounting method). Here we show that the income-based accounting method reveals new GHG emission profiles for nations and sectors. The rapid development of mining industries drives income-based GHG emissions of resource-exporting nations (e.g., Australia, Canada, and Russia) during 1995-2009. Moreover, the rapid development of sectors producing basic materials and providing financial intermediation services drives income-based GHG emissions of developing nations (e.g., China, Indonesia, India, and Brazil) during this period. The income-based accounting can support supply side policy decisions and provide additional information for determining GHG emission quotas based on cumulative emissions of nations and designing policies for shared responsibilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accounting methods", "Cumulative emissions", "Developing nations", "GHG mitigation", "Global climate changes", "Policy decisions", "Primary inputs", "Shared responsibility", "China", "Climate Change", "Greenhouse Effect", "Income", "India"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019224026", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"]], "AuthorData": {"36453970600": {"Name": "Liang S.", "AuthorID": "36453970600", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan"}, "56937768600": {"Name": "Qu S.", "AuthorID": "56937768600", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan"}, "57194741610": {"Name": "Zhu Z.", "AuthorID": "57194741610", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan"}, "55519747200": {"Name": "Xu M.", "AuthorID": "55519747200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Michigan"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}}}
