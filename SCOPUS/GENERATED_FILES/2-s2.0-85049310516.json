Archeological and paleontological remains are found clearly associated in lacustrine deposits traversed by a small channel. This paper provides new data about the lithic assemblage from level D, focusing on the abundant active percussion implements that form a part of the highly divers set of limestone macro-tools unique to this assemblage. Morpho-technological and experimental analysis of these tools allows us to hypothesize about the kinds of activities that might have been carried out by hominins at this site. Experimental work allows us to define percussive trace morphologies and to identify new types of percussion tools in the collection, beyond those of classical, ellipsoidal morphology. Analysis of the stone surfaces used for active percussion demonstrates that, while some of the tools could have been used for stone knapping, other hammer morphologies are not well adapted for this kind of activity. The morphology of the tools and the type of percussion damage displayed on their active surfaces provide criteria with which to widen the activity range of the hominins that used them. This study of the percussion instruments from Barranco Le\u00f3n contributes essential data with which to buttress the growing interest in the macro component of Oldowan stone toolkits African and Eurasian sites and their possible uses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barranco Le\u00f3n", "Experimental archeology", "Late lower pleistocene", "Manuport", "Oldowan"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049310516", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57200226721": {"Name": "Titton S.", "AuthorID": "57200226721", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Area de Prehistoria, Universitat Rovira I Virgili (URV)"}, "7003608055": {"Name": "Barsky D.", "AuthorID": "7003608055", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Area de Prehistoria, Universitat Rovira I Virgili (URV)"}, "7006881093": {"Name": "Verg\u00e8s J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006881093", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Area de Prehistoria, Universitat Rovira I Virgili (URV)"}, "56963832900": {"Name": "Guardiola M.", "AuthorID": "56963832900", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Archaeology and Population in Africa, Department of Genetics and Evolution, Anthropology Unit, University of Geneva"}, "7005992902": {"Name": "Sala-Ramos R.", "AuthorID": "7005992902", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Area de Prehistoria, Universitat Rovira I Virgili (URV)"}, "35241979000": {"Name": "Bargallo A.", "AuthorID": "35241979000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Archaeology"}, "57218294601": {"Name": "Solano J.G.", "AuthorID": "57218294601", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "University of Granada, Department of Prehistory and Archaeology, Campus Universitario de Cartuja S/n, Universidad de Granada"}, "36634302200": {"Name": "Jimenez Arenas J.M.", "AuthorID": "36634302200", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "University of Granada, Department of Prehistory and Archaeology, Campus Universitario de Cartuja S/n, Universidad de Granada"}, "26326593000": {"Name": "Toro-Moyano I.", "AuthorID": "26326593000", "AffiliationID": "120897218", "AffiliationName": "Archaeological Museum of Granada"}}}
