All rights reserved.The relationship between bone and skeletal muscle mass may be affected by physical training. No studies have prospectively examined the bone and skeletal muscle responses to a short controlled exercise-training programme. We hypothesised that a short exercise-training period would affect muscle and bone mass together. Methods: Femoral bone and Rectus femoris Volumes (RF VOL) were determined by magnetic resonance imaging in 215 healthy army recruits, and bone mineral density (BMD) by Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and repeated after 12 weeks of regulated physical training. Results: Pre-training, RF VOL was smaller in smokers than non-smokers (100.9 \u00b1 20.2 vs. 108.7 \u00b1 24.5, p = 0.018; 96.2 \u00b1 16.9 vs. 104.8 \u00b1 21.3, p = 0.002 for dominant/non-dominant limbs), although increases in RF VOL with training (of 14.2 \u00b1 14.5% and 13.2 \u00b1 15.6%] respectively, p < 0.001) were independent of prior smoking status. Pre-training RF VOL was related to bone cortical volume (r 2 = 0.21 and 0.30, p < 0.001 for dominant and non-dominant legs), and specifically to periosteal (r 2 = 0.21 and 0.23, p < 0.001) volume. Pre-training dominant RF VOL was independently associated with Total Hip BMD (p < 0.001). Training-related increases in RF VOL and bone volumes were related. Whilst smokers demonstrated lower muscle mass than non-smokers, differences were abolished with training. Training-related increases in muscle mass were related to increases in periosteal bone volume in both dominant and non-dominant legs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Exercise", "Femur", "Humans", "Military Personnel", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Smoking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925359555", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6508205361": {"Name": "Puthucheary Z.", "AuthorID": "6508205361", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "31367662100": {"Name": "Rawal J.", "AuthorID": "31367662100", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Human Health and Performance, NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.E.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Human Health and Performance, NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "54904585300": {"Name": "Kordi M.", "AuthorID": "54904585300", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "13604823800": {"Name": "Eleftheriou K.I.", "AuthorID": "13604823800", "AffiliationID": "108229307", "AffiliationName": "Hippocrateon Private Hospital"}, "7403334885": {"Name": "Payne J.", "AuthorID": "7403334885", "AffiliationID": "60103293", "AffiliationName": "Scottish National Advanced Heart Failure Service, Golden Jubilee National Hospital"}}}
