They are classified into a number of morphological and functional phenotypes that can be caused by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. The dominant themes in papers published in 2012-2013 are similar to those reported in Almanac 2011, namely, the use (and interpretation) of genetic testing, development and application of novel non-invasive imaging techniques and use of serum biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. An important innovation since the last Almanac is the development of more sophisticated models for predicting adverse clinical events.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiomyopathies", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931829845", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"24481305600": {"Name": "Guttmann O.P.", "AuthorID": "24481305600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Diseases Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Diseases Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "6701721053": {"Name": "Mohiddin S.A.", "AuthorID": "6701721053", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, London Chest Hospital"}}}
