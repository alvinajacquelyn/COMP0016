The role of stem cells is to provide a renewable source of cells that give rise to TACs to provide the cell numbers that are necessary for cell differentiation. Regulation of the formation of TACs is thus fundamental to controlling cell replacement. Here, we analyze the properties of a population of mesenchymal TACs in the continuously growing mouse incisor to identify key components of the molecular regulation that drives proliferation. We show that the polycomb repressive complex 1 acts as a global regulator of the TAC phenotype by its direct action on the expression of key cell-cycle regulatory genes and by regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-signaling activity. We also identify an essential requirement for TACs in maintaining mesenchymal stem cells, which is indicative of a positive feedback mechanism. Using a combination of transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, An et al. show that polycomb Ring1 in transit-amplifying cells acts as a global regulator by directly inhibiting Cdkn2a and regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-signaling activity. Loss of proliferation of TACs results in MSC apoptosis, yielding positive feedback between TACs and mesenchymal stem cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apoptosis", "cell cycle", "mesenchyme", "polycomb", "proliferation", "Ring1b", "transit-amplifying cell", "Wnt"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Cycle", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genome", "Histone Code", "Incisor", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Mice", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 1", "Stem Cell Niche", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047386559", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56402581700": {"Name": "An Z.", "AuthorID": "56402581700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, Dental Institute, Kings College"}, "57202190780": {"Name": "Akily B.", "AuthorID": "57202190780", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, Dental Institute, Kings College"}, "57200387531": {"Name": "Sabalic M.", "AuthorID": "57200387531", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, Dental Institute, Kings College"}, "57202195016": {"Name": "Zong G.", "AuthorID": "57202195016", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, Dental Institute, Kings College"}, "55630518500": {"Name": "Sharpe P.T.", "AuthorID": "55630518500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, Dental Institute, Kings College"}, "57203424922": {"Name": "Chai Y.", "AuthorID": "57203424922", "AffiliationID": "60019009, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Center for Craniofacial Molecular Biology, University of Southern California"}}}
