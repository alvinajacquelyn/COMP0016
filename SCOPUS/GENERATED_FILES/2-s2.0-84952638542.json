Co-inhibitory receptor ligands are highly expressed by a variety of malignancies allowing evasion of anti-tumour immunity. Recent studies demonstrate that manipulation of these co-inhibitory pathways can remove the immunological brakes that impede endogenous immune responses against tumours. Antibodies that block the interactions between co-inhibitory receptors and their ligands have delivered very promising clinical responses, as has been shown by recent successful trials targeting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action and expression pattern of co-inhibitory receptors on different T cells subsets, emphasising differences between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We also summarise recent clinical findings utilising immune checkpoint blockade.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer immunotherapy", "CTLA-4", "Inhibitory checkpoints", "Inhibitory receptors on T cells", "PD-1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Neoplasms", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952638542", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56974140800": {"Name": "\u015aledzi\u0144ska A.", "AuthorID": "56974140800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "36461371900": {"Name": "Menger L.", "AuthorID": "36461371900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "47460953400": {"Name": "Bergerhoff K.", "AuthorID": "47460953400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "12762916100": {"Name": "Quezada S.", "AuthorID": "12762916100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL"}}}
