To further our knowledge, this paper examines the pull-out characteristics of waste tire strips in a compacted sand, together with uniaxial and biaxial geogrids also tested under the same conditions. The analysis of the results shows that the interlocking effect and pull-out resistance between the tire strip and the sand is very strong and significantly higher than that of the geogrids. In the early stages of the pull-out test, the resistance is mainly provided by the front portion of the embedded tire strips, as the pull-out test continues, more and more of the areas towards the end of the tire strips are mobilized, showing a progressive failure mechanism. The deformations are proportional to the frictional resistance between the tire-sand interface, and increase as the normal stresses increase. Tire strips of different wear intensities were tested and presented different pull-out resistances; however, the pull-out resistance mobilization patterns were generally similar. The pull-out resistance values obtained show that rubber reinforcement can provide much higher pull-out forces than the geogrid reinforcements tested here, showing that waste tires are an excellent alternative as a reinforcing system, regardless of the environmental advantages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Frictional resistance", "Geogrid", "Interface properties", "Load displacement behavior", "Pull-out tests", "Reinforced soil", "Rubber", "Waste tires"], "IndexKeywords": ["Frictional resistance", "Geogrids", "Interface property", "Load-displacement behavior", "Pull-out test", "Reinforced soil", "Waste tires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021636151", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7501447027": {"Name": "Li L.H.", "AuthorID": "7501447027", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57194687170": {"Name": "Chen Y.J.", "AuthorID": "57194687170", "AffiliationID": "60108756", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Environment, Hubei University of Technology"}, "7401565435": {"Name": "Xiao H.L.", "AuthorID": "7401565435", "AffiliationID": "60108756", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Environment, Hubei University of Technology"}, "57200769511": {"Name": "Ferreira P.M.V.", "AuthorID": "57200769511", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London-UCL"}, "56336416800": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56336416800", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore"}}}
