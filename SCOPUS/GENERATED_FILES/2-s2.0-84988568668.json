Two techniques were compared using Abaqus: (1) void material properties were assigned to pores; (2) multiple enrichment regions with independent crack-growth possibilities were employed. Both were applied to 2D models of transverse images of mouse bone with differing porous structures. Results revealed that assigning multiple enrichment regions allows for multiple cracks to be initiated progressively, which cannot be captured when the voids are filled. Therefore, filling pores with one enrichment region in the model will not create realistic fracture patterns in Abaqus-XFEM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crack propagation", "intra-cortical porosity", "microstructure", "osteogenesis imperfecta", "XFEM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cortical porosity", "Extended finite element method", "Fracture pattern", "Mouse bones", "Multiple crack", "Osteogenesis imperfecta", "Porous structures", "XFEM", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Disease Models, Animal", "Finite Element Analysis", "Fractures, Bone", "Mice", "Models, Theoretical", "Osteogenesis Imperfecta", "Porosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988568668", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55539055900": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Florez N.", "AuthorID": "55539055900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "24480634300": {"Name": "Carriero A.", "AuthorID": "24480634300", "AffiliationID": "60010339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Florida Institute of Technology"}, "6507317962": {"Name": "Shefelbine S.", "AuthorID": "6507317962", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and Department of Bioengineering, Northeastern University"}}}
