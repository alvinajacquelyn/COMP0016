One of the fairly general extensions of the formula, known as Meyer-It\u00d4, applies to one dimensional semimartingales and convex functions. There are also satisfactory generalizations of It\u00d4's formula for diffusion processes where the Meyer-It\u00d4 assumptions are weakened even further. We study a version of It\u00d4's formula for multi-dimensional finite variation L\u00e9vy processes assuming that the underlying function is continuous and admits weak derivatives. We also discuss some applications of this extension, particularly in finance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite variation L\u00e9vy process", "It\u00d4's formula", "PIDE", "Weak derivative"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930865006", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36198696600": {"Name": "Okhrati R.", "AuthorID": "36198696600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "6506591399": {"Name": "Schmock U.", "AuthorID": "6506591399", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "Vienna University of Technology"}}}
