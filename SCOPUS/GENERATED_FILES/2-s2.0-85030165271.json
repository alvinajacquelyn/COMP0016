METHODS The study group included 22 liver transplant patients. Among them, 18 patients were mismatched for the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) alleles (don+/ rec-), and 4 were matched (don+/rec+). Seven of the mismatched patients produced anti-GSTT1 antibodies and developed plasma cell-rich rejection (former de novo immune hepatitis). For the detection of specific T lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. The memory T cell response was studied by adding to the cell cultures to a mix of 39 custom-made, 15-mer overlapping peptides, which covered the entire GSTT1 amino acid sequence. The specific cellular response to peptides was analyzed by flow cytometry using the markers CD8, CD4, IL-4 and IFN\u03b3. RESULTS Activation of CD8+ T cells with different peptides was observed exclusively in the group of patients with plasma-cell rich rejection (3 out of 7), with production of IL-4 and/or IFN\u03b3 at a rate of 1%-4.92% depending on the peptides. The CD4+ response was most common and not exclusive for patients with the disease, where 5 out of 7 showed percentages of activated cells from 1.24% to 31.34%. Additionally, two patients without the disease but with the mismatch had cells that became stimulated with some peptides (1.45%-5.18%). Highly unexpected was the finding of a double positive CD4+CD8low T cell population that showed the highest degree of activation with some of the peptides in 7 patients with the mismatch, in 4 patients with plasma cell-rich rejection and in 3 patients without the disease. Unfortunately, CD4+CD8low cells represent 1% of the total number of lymphocytes, and stimulation could not be analyzed in 9 patients due to the low number of gated cells. Cells from the 4 patients included as controls did not show activation with any of the peptides. CONCLUSION Patients with GSTT1 mismatch can develop a specific T-cell response, but the potential role of this response in the pathogenesis of plasma cell-rich rejection is unknown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["De novo immune hepatitis", "Donor-specific glutathione S-transferase T1 antibodies", "Donor/recipient mismatch", "Glutathione S-transferase T1-memory T cells", "Indirect presentation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030165271", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"36437283300": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Bravo M.", "AuthorID": "36437283300", "AffiliationID": "60033267, 60033284, 60103764", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Service, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla"}, "56973521600": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez B.", "AuthorID": "56973521600", "AffiliationID": "60033267, 60033284, 60103764", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Service, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla"}, "7006282126": {"Name": "Acevedo M.", "AuthorID": "7006282126", "AffiliationID": "60033267, 60033284, 60103764", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Service, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla"}, "56187796500": {"Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Rold\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "56187796500", "AffiliationID": "60033267, 60033284, 60103764", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Service, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla"}, "56247772700": {"Name": "Aguilera I.", "AuthorID": "56247772700", "AffiliationID": "60033267, 60033284, 60103764", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Service, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla"}, "7202617798": {"Name": "Sousa J.", "AuthorID": "7202617798", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Diseases Service, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo"}, "6507565929": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Bravo M.", "AuthorID": "6507565929", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo"}}}
