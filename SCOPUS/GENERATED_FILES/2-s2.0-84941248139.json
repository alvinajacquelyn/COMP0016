Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.While the first-order Born approximation is increasingly being used in many seismic tomography efforts, its domain of validity to forward model seismic waveforms has not been quantified in the context of current 3-D earth models yet. We here address this issue by comparing teleseismic synthetic surface waveforms calculated using the Born approximation with spectral element method solutions for a variety of realistic global 3-D earth models. We find that the Born approximation has a very limited domain of validity when applied to seismic waveforms. Specifically, it can only accurately model the phase (amplitude) of surface waveforms for source-receiver paths leading to time shifts smaller than about 15 per cent (5 per cent) of the wave period considered. These conditions usually occur in earth models as S20RTS or S40RTS combined with a homogeneous crust for periods longer than T ~ 80-90 s. For models with stronger heterogeneity and/or realistic 3-D crustal structure, only the phase of waveforms with periods longer than ~120-130 s can be accurately modelled with the Born approximation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Seismic tomography", "Surface waves and free oscillations", "Theoretical seismology", "Wave propagation", "Wave scattering and diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["First order born approximations", "Seismic tomography", "Source-receiver path", "Spectral element method", "Surface waves and free oscillations", "Synthetic surfaces", "Theoretical seismologies", "Wave scattering and diffractions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941248139", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56321076900": {"Name": "Parisi L.", "AuthorID": "56321076900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "14119629500": {"Name": "Ferreira A.M.G.", "AuthorID": "14119629500", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "ICIST, DECivil, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "6701574346": {"Name": "Capdeville Y.", "AuthorID": "6701574346", "AffiliationID": "60032006, 60105669, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Plan\u00e9tologie et G\u00e9odynamique de Nantes (UMR 6112), CNRS"}}}
