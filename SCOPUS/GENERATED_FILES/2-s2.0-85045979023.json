Here we investigated whether the TGI percept originates spinally or centrally. Since the inhibition of nociceptive input by concomitant non-nociceptive somatosensory input has a strong spinal component, we reasoned that, if the afferent input underlying the TGI originates at spinal level, then the TGI should be inhibited by a concomitant non-nociceptive somatosensory input. Conversely, if TGI is the result of supraspinal processing, then no effect of touch on TGI would be expected. We elicited TGI sensations in a purely thermal condition without tactile input, and found no evidence that tactile input affected the TGI. These results provide further evidence against a spinal mechanism generating the afferent input producing the TGI, and indicate that the peculiar burning sensation of the TGI results from supraspinal interactions between thermoceptive and nociceptive systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Hot Temperature", "Humans", "Illusions", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Nociception", "Pain Perception", "Signal Transduction", "Thermosensing", "Touch", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045979023", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35408852800": {"Name": "Ferr\u00e8 E.R.", "AuthorID": "35408852800", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57220608435": {"Name": "Van Dijk J.A.", "AuthorID": "57220608435", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.D.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
