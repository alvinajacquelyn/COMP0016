The Modern Law Review. and 2017 TheModern Law Review Limited.In Human Rights Watch v Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal found that the relevant standard of \u2018victim status\u2019 that applies in secret surveillance cases consists in a potential risk of being subjected to surveillance and that the European Convention on Human Rights does not apply to the surveillance of individuals who reside outside of the UK. This note argues that the Tribunal\u2019s finding regarding the victim status of the applicants was sound but that the underlying reasoning was not. It concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s finding on extraterritoriality is unsatisfactory and that its engagement with the European Court of Human Rights case law on the matter lacked depth. Finally, the note considers the defects of the Human Rights Watch case, and the case law on extraterritoriality more generally, against the backdrop of the place of principled reasoning in human rights adjudication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["European convention on human rights", "Extraterritoriality", "Privacy", "Regulation of investigatory powers act 2000", "Surveillance", "Victim status"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018326124", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57194014349": {"Name": "Raible L.", "AuthorID": "57194014349", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Laws, University College London"}}}
