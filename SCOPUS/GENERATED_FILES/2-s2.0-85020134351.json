Previous experience suggests that infection rates appear to be higher after implantable pulse generator (IPG) replacement surgery than after the de novo DBS procedure. In this study the authors examine the effect of a change in practice during DBS IPG replacements at their institution. METHODS: Starting in January 2012, patient screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and, and where necessary, eradication was performed prior to elective DBS IPG change. Moreover, topical vancomycin was placed in the IPG pocket during surgery. The authors then prospectively examined the infection rate in patients undergoing DBS IPG replacement at their center over a 3-year period with at least 9 months of follow-up. RESULTS: The total incidence of infection in this prospective consecutive series of 101 IPG replacement procedures was 0%, with a mean follow-up duration of 24 \u00b1 11 months. This was significantly lower than the authors' previously published historical control group, prior to implementing the change in practice, where the infection rate for IPG replacement was 8.5% (8/94 procedures; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a change in clinical practice can significantly lower infection rates in patients undergoing DBS IPG replacement. These simple measures can minimize unnecessary surgery, loss of benefit from chronic stimulation, and costly hardware replacement, further improving the cost efficacy of DBS therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic", "Deep brain stimulation", "Functional neurosurgery", "Implantable pulse generator", "Infection", "Parkinson's disease", "Reoperation", "Vancomycin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Topical", "Adult", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Implantable Neurostimulators", "Infection Control", "Male", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Vancomycin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020134351", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55506180800": {"Name": "Pepper J.", "AuthorID": "55506180800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "57194423746": {"Name": "Meliak L.", "AuthorID": "57194423746", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "23768093200": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "23768093200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56590126600": {"Name": "Milabo C.", "AuthorID": "56590126600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "56133515000": {"Name": "Candelario J.", "AuthorID": "56133515000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24511900500": {"Name": "Curtis C.", "AuthorID": "24511900500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospital"}}}
