The chipset is suitable for low-power ultrahigh-speed wireless communication and can be used in both homodyne and heterodyne architectures. The TX consists of an I/Q modulator, a frequency tripler, and a broadband three-stage power amplifier. It has single sideband (SSB) conversion gain of 25 dB and saturated output power of 9 dBm. The RX includes an I/Q demodulator with D-band amplifier and \u00d7 3 multiplier chain at the LO port. The RX provides a conversion gain of 26 dB and has noise figure of 9 dB. A 48-Gbit/s direct quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) data transmission using a 144-GHz millimeter-wave carrier signal is demonstrated with a bit error rate (BER) of 2.3 \u00d7 10-3 and energy efficiency of 7.44 pJ/bit. An 18-Gbit/s 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal was transmitted in heterodyne mode with measured TX-to-RX error vector magnitude (EVM) of less than 6.8% and spectrum efficiency of 3.6 bit/s/Hz. The TX and RX have dc power consumption of 165 and 192 mW, respectively. The chip area of each TX and RX circuit is 1.3 \u00d7 0.9 mm2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bit error rate (BER)", "direct conversion", "I/Q transceiver", "millimeter-wave (mmW) integrated circuits", "mmW wireless communication", "monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs)", "quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)", "quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK)", "Wireless link"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct conversion", "Millimeter wave (MMW)", "mmW wireless communications", "Monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs)", "Quadrature-amplitude modulations (QAM)", "Quaternary phase shift keying", "Wireless link"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977944592", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56024601400": {"Name": "Carpenter S.", "AuthorID": "56024601400", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "55773261300": {"Name": "Nopchinda D.", "AuthorID": "55773261300", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "23468770100": {"Name": "Abbasi M.", "AuthorID": "23468770100", "AffiliationID": "60004923", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, North Carolina State University"}, "57171216500": {"Name": "He Z.", "AuthorID": "57171216500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "36834956900": {"Name": "Bao M.", "AuthorID": "36834956900", "AffiliationID": "60016575", "AffiliationName": "Microwave System Radio Access Technologies, Ericsson AB"}, "35617103600": {"Name": "Eriksson T.", "AuthorID": "35617103600", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "7004447241": {"Name": "Zirath H.", "AuthorID": "7004447241", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
