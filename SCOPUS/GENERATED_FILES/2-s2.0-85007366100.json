Using Two-Dimensional (2D) and Three-Dimensional (3D) models, as well as the Baseline-Reynolds Stress Model (BSL-RSM) and the k-\u03c9 Shear Stress Transport (k-\u03c9 SST) model in its fully turbulent and laminar-to-turbulent formulation, differences in power output modeling accuracy were evaluated against experimental results from literature. The highest correlation was found using a 3D domain model that fully resolved the boundary layer combined with the k-\u03c9 SST laminar-to-turbulent model. The turbulent 3D fully resolved boundary layer k-\u03c9 SST model also accurately predicted power output for most rotational rates, at a significantly reduced computational cost when compared to its laminar-to-turbulent formulation. The 3D fully resolved BSL-RSM model and 3D wall function boundary layer k-\u03c9 SST model were found to poorly simulate power output. Poor output predictions were also obtained using 2D domain k-\u03c9 SST models, as they were unable to account for blade tip and strut effects. The authors suggest that 3D domain fully turbulent k-\u03c9 SST models with fully resolved boundary layer meshes are used for predicting turbine power output given their accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational domain", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Laminar-to-turbulent transition", "Turbulence model", "Vertical axis turbine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational domains", "Computational fluid dynamics modeling", "Laminar to turbulent transitions", "Shear-stress transport", "Three-dimensional (3D) model", "Three-dimensional domain", "Vertical axis tidal turbines", "Vertical axis turbines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007366100", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"56111937800": {"Name": "Marsh P.", "AuthorID": "56111937800", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "14069017800": {"Name": "Penesis I.", "AuthorID": "14069017800", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "24831078800": {"Name": "Ranmuthugala D.", "AuthorID": "24831078800", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Ports and Shipping, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
