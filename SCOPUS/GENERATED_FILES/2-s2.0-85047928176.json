HF, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, is characterized by sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is rapidly growing and the risk of developing HF is higher among DM patients. DM is responsible for several macro- and micro-angiopathies that contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and diabetic nephropathy (DN) as well. Independently of CAD, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and DM increase the risk of HF. Individuals with diabetic nephropathy are likely to present a distinct pathological condition, defined as diabetic cardiomyopathy, even in the absence of hypertension or CAD, whose pathogenesis is only partially known. However, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of diabetic cardiomyopathy: increased oxidative stress, altered substrate metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS), insulin resistance, and autonomic dysfunction. In this review, we will focus on the involvement of sympathetic system hyperactivity in the diabetic nephropathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenergic system", "Diabetic nephropathy", "GRK2", "Heart failure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diabetic Cardiomyopathies", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Sympathetic Nervous System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047928176", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55391030100": {"Name": "Komici K.", "AuthorID": "55391030100", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "9535074800": {"Name": "Corbi G.", "AuthorID": "9535074800", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "56196018200": {"Name": "Femminella G.D.", "AuthorID": "56196018200", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "56491188600": {"Name": "Cannavo A.", "AuthorID": "56491188600", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57194680251": {"Name": "Bencivenga L.", "AuthorID": "57194680251", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "7003987300": {"Name": "Leosco D.", "AuthorID": "7003987300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "35414915500": {"Name": "Ferrara N.", "AuthorID": "35414915500", "AffiliationID": "60172257", "AffiliationName": "Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SPA - Societ\u00e0 Benefit, IRCCS - Istituto Scientifico di Telese"}, "16031800600": {"Name": "Rengo G.", "AuthorID": "16031800600", "AffiliationID": "60172257", "AffiliationName": "Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SPA - Societ\u00e0 Benefit, IRCCS - Istituto Scientifico di Telese"}, "6505895452": {"Name": "de Lucia C.", "AuthorID": "6505895452", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine and Department of Pharmacology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}}}
