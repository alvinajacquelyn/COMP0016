To this end, we deploy virtualized small base stations (vSBSs) in SDR devices that offer network-slicing virtualization option. The proposed virtualized solution relies on Fed4Fire wireless experimental platform. In particular, we assume that multiple IoT devices can have access to different vSBSs, which coordinate their resources in a cooperative manner using machine learning (ML). To this end, a proactive resource management is deployed in the unlicensed band, where a cooperative solution is facilitated using the licensed band. The cooperative network slicing is managed and orchestrated using small cell virtualization offered by the Fed4Fire. Experimental trials are carried out for certain number of users and results are obtained that highlight the benefit of employing cooperative cognitive network slicing in future virtualized wireless networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cooperative machine learning", "NB-IoT", "Network slicing", "Wireless network virtualization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive network", "Cooperative networks", "Experimental platform", "Experimental trials", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "IOT applications", "Network slicing", "Resource management"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094150359", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6601990159": {"Name": "Karetsos G.", "AuthorID": "6601990159", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "University of Thessaly, Department of Digital Systems"}, "55901350900": {"Name": "Tziouvaras A.", "AuthorID": "55901350900", "AffiliationID": "125271618", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Innovations"}, "55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "125271618", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Innovations"}}}
