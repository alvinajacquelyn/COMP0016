PINK1 is a mitochondrially targeted kinase that regulates multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology, from oxidative phosphorylation to mitochondrial clearance. PINK1 itself is also phosphorylated, and this might be linked to the regulation of its multiple activities. Here we systematically analyze four previously identified phosphorylation sites in PINK1 for their role in autophosphorylation, substrate phosphorylation, and mitophagy. Our data indicate that two of these sites, Ser-228 and Ser-402, are autophosphorylated on truncated PINK1 but not on full-length PINK1, suggesting that the N terminus has an inhibitory effect on phosphorylation. We furthermore establish that phosphorylation of these PINK1 residues regulates the phosphorylation of the substrates Parkin and Ubiquitin. Especially Ser-402 phosphorylation appears to be important for PINK1 function because it is involved in Parkin recruitment and the induction of mitophagy. Finally, we identify Thr-313 as a residue that is critical for PINK1 catalytic activity, but, in contrast to previous reports, we find no evidence that this activity is regulated by phosphorylation. These data clarify the regulation of PINK1 through multisite phosphorylation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autophosphorylation", "Inhibitory effect", "Multi-site", "N terminus", "Oxidative phosphorylation", "Parkinson disease", "Phosphorylation sites", "Ubiquitin", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Membranes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Serine", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921925390", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56072226800": {"Name": "Aerts L.", "AuthorID": "56072226800", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetics, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders, University of Leuven"}, "6602698955": {"Name": "Craessaerts K.", "AuthorID": "6602698955", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetics, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders, University of Leuven"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7003412148": {"Name": "Morais V.", "AuthorID": "7003412148", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetics, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders, University of Leuven"}}}
