Consequently, stakeholders can greatly benefit from decision-making support tools that integrate the complexity of the system along with the uncertainties inherent to the problem. Accordingly, a general methodology is proposed in this work for the evaluation of integrated shale gas and water supply chains under uncertainty. First, key parametric uncertainties are identified from a candidate pool via a global sensitivity analysis based on a deterministic optimization model. Then, a two-stage stochastic model is developed considering only the key uncertain parameters in the problem. Moreover, the merits of modeling uncertainty and implementing the stochastic solution approach are evaluated using the expected value of perfect information and the value of the stochastic solution metrics. Furthermore, the conditional value-at-risk approach was implemented to evaluate different risk-aversion levels and the corresponding impacts on the shale gas development plan. The proposed methodology is illustrated through two real-world case studies involving six and eight potential well-pad locations and two options of well-pad layouts. \u00a9 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 65: 924\u2013936, 2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["shale gas", "stochastic optimization framework", "supply chain design", "uncertainty", "water management"], "IndexKeywords": ["American Institute of Chemical Engineers", "Conditional Value-at-Risk", "Deterministic optimization", "Global sensitivity analysis", "Stochastic optimizations", "Supply chain design", "Two-stage stochastic models", "uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058684494", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57188688247": {"Name": "Guerra O.J.", "AuthorID": "57188688247", "AffiliationID": "60030451", "AffiliationName": "National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)"}, "7006804215": {"Name": "Reklaitis G.V.", "AuthorID": "7006804215", "AffiliationID": "60009254", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University"}, "56810581700": {"Name": "Calder\u00f3n A.J.", "AuthorID": "56810581700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
