Yet International Relations (IR) still lacks a more systematic and critical attention to the role of technological infrastructures in contemporary global governance dynamics. Here, we seek to prompt IR scholars to move \u2018large technical systems\u2019 (LTSs) from the contours of IR narratives to a centre stage, as they hold the potential to respond to pressing challenges for IR scholarship. Employing LTSs to respond to recent publications on the challenge that \u2018global governance\u2019 poses to IR, we highlight that an STS-IR encounter can, first, revitalise \u2018grand questions\u2019 at the heart of IR and, second, help coping with the complexity of global governance. While this encounter does not offer a ready-tailored panacea for the troubles of IR, a more systematic inquiry into LTSs is a powerful step beyond theoretical and methodological impasses, towards greater inter-disciplinary collaboration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Global governance", "Grand questions", "IR theory", "Large technical systems", "Science and technology studies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922031692", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"35763041100": {"Name": "Mayer M.", "AuthorID": "35763041100", "AffiliationID": "60006332", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Kennedy School"}, "26021005000": {"Name": "Acuto M.", "AuthorID": "26021005000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}}}
