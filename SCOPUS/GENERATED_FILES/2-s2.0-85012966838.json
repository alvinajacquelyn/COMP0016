Electronic health records provide a rich source of patient data which could help policymakers to better understand needs of the service users. The main objective of this study is to unveil statistics of diagnoses recorded in the Case Register of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest mental health providers in the UK and Europe serving a source population of over 1.2 million people residing in south London. Based on over 500,000 diagnoses recorded in ICD10 codes for a cohort of approximately 200,000 mental health patients, we established frequency rate of each diagnosis (the ratio of the number of patients for whom a diagnosis has ever been recorded to the number of patients in the entire population who have made contact with mental disorders). We also investigated differences in diagnoses prevalence between subgroups of patients stratified by gender and ethnicity. The most common diagnoses in the considered population were (recurrent) depression (ICD10 codes F32-33;16.4% of patients), reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders (F43;7.1%), mental/behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10;6.9%), and schizophrenia (F20;5.6%). We also found many diagnoses which were more likely to be recorded in patients of a certain gender or ethnicity. For example, mood (affective) disorders (F31-F39); neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40-F48, except F42); and eating disorders (F50) were more likely to be found in records of female patients, while males were more likely to be diagnosed with mental/behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19). Furthermore, mental/behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol and opioids were more likely to be recorded in patients of white ethnicity, and disorders due to use of cannabinoids in those of black ethnicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic Health Records", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Registries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012966838", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26534433200": {"Name": "Kovalchuk Y.", "AuthorID": "26534433200", "AffiliationID": "60100434", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Digital Technology, Faculty of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment, Birmingham City University"}, "35594617600": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "35594617600", "AffiliationID": "60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "57197063791": {"Name": "Broadbent M.", "AuthorID": "57197063791", "AffiliationID": "60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London, Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "19534744500": {"Name": "Hubbard T.J.P.", "AuthorID": "19534744500", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}}}
