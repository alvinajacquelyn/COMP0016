The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we extend a new scheduling technique, which moves activities in order to improve the project net present value. This more general version is applicable to multiple problem formulations and provides an overarching framework in which these models can be implemented. The changes in activity finish times take other activities and the possible changes in the finish times of these other activities into account, by forming a set of activities which is subsequently moved in time. The scheduling technique is implemented within a genetic algorithm metaheuristic and employs two penalty functions, one for deadline feasibility and one for non-renewable resource feasibility. Second, we test the proposed approach on several datasets from literature and illustrate the added value of each part of the algorithm. The influence of data parameters on the project net present value is highlighted. The detailed results provided in this paper can be used as future benchmarks for each of the six models discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metaheuristics", "Net present value", "Payment models", "Resource-constrained project scheduling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Discounted cash flow", "Meta heuristics", "Multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem", "Net present value", "Non-renewable resource", "Problem formulation", "Resource constrained project scheduling", "Scheduling techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949604382", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"56423568700": {"Name": "Leyman P.", "AuthorID": "56423568700", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University"}, "6602303040": {"Name": "Vanhoucke M.", "AuthorID": "6602303040", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}}}
