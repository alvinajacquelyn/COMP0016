Meanwhile, their antimicrobial activity is scarcely reported, although BMNPs can potentially achieve unique chemical transformations and synergetic effects can be presented. Towards this direction a reproducible simple hybrid polyol process under moderate temperature solvothermal conditions has been applied for the isolation of non-oxide contaminated bimetallic CuFe nanoparticles (NPs). 1,2-propylene glycol (PG), tetraethylene glycol (TEG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000), that exhibit different physicochemical properties, have been utilized to regulate the size, structure, composition and the surface chemistry of NPs. The BMNPs were found to be of small crystalline size, 30\u201345 nm, and high hydrophilicity, different wt% percentage of organic coating and variable hydrodynamic size and surface charge. The antimicrobial activity of the BMNPs was evaluated against the bacterial strains B. subtilis, E. coli and fungus S. cerevisiae. The IC50 values for CuFe NPs were found significantly lower compared with Cu NPs of the same size, revealing an enhancement in the antimicrobial activity when iron and copper coexist in the crystal structure. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured intracellularly and extracellularly by the nitroblue tetrazolium assay in the fungal cultures. No extracellular ROS were measured suggesting that both CuFe and Cu NPs enter the fungal cells during the incubation, also verified by optical imaging of the fungal cells in the presence of NPs. Higher ROS concentrations were generated intracellularly for CuFe NPs supporting different red/ox reaction mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial activity", "Bimetallic nanoparticles", "CuFe nanoparticles", "PEGylated", "Reactive oxygen species"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Antifungal Agents", "Bacillus subtilis", "Copper", "Escherichia coli", "Iron", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Optical Imaging", "Particle Size", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030084759", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57195923042": {"Name": "Antonoglou O.", "AuthorID": "57195923042", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Lab of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "55903000400": {"Name": "Giannousi K.", "AuthorID": "55903000400", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Lab of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6602808703": {"Name": "Dendrinou-Samara C.", "AuthorID": "6602808703", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Lab of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6601911470": {"Name": "Pantazaki A.", "AuthorID": "6601911470", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Lab of Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7003992402": {"Name": "Arvanitidis J.", "AuthorID": "7003992402", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "16507083500": {"Name": "Mourdikoudis S.", "AuthorID": "16507083500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London (UCL)"}}}
