The mouse is an increasingly important animal model of visual function in health and disease. In mice, most retinal signals are routed through the superficial layers of the midbrain superior colliculus, and it is well established that much of the visual behaviour of mice relies on activity in the superior colliculus. The functional organization of visual signals in the mouse superior colliculus is, however, not well established in awake animals. We therefore made extracellular recordings from the superficial layers of the superior colliculus in awake mice, while the animals were viewing visual stimuli including flashed spots and drifting gratings. We find that neurons in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus of awake mouse generally show short latency, brisk responses. Receptive fields are usually \u2018ON\u2013OFF\u2019 with a preference for black stimuli, and are weakly non-linear in response to gratings and other forms of luminance modulation. Population responses to drifting gratings are highly contrast sensitive, with a robust response to spatial frequencies above 0.3 cycles degree \u22121 and temporal frequencies above 15 Hz. The receptive fields are also often speed-tuned or direction-selective. Analysis of the response across multiple stimulus dimensions reveals at least five functionally distinct groups of units. We also find that eye movements affect measurements of receptive field properties in awake animals, and show how these may be mitigated in analyses. Qualitatively similar responses were obtained in urethane-anaesthetized animals, although receptive fields in awake animals had higher contrast sensitivity, shorter visual latency and a stronger response to high temporal frequencies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Eye Movements", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Superior Colliculi", "Wakefulness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056350045", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"57191979677": {"Name": "De Franceschi G.", "AuthorID": "57191979677", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7401460528": {"Name": "Solomon S.", "AuthorID": "7401460528", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
