Direct products of diene hydroboration, however, have received little attention, with most substrates being assumed to produce the antiMarkovnikov product expected from textbook organic chemistry understanding. Previous experimental studies have observed the presence of a plethora of hydroboration products, and a significant progress has been made in assigning species to experimental data- though often with contradicting results. This study has used a computational approach employing quantum chemical calculations to determine atomic charges of cyclic and acyclic dienes and correlate these with calculated activation energy barriers in order to predict the regioand stereoselective outcome of hydroboration reactions. Results indicated a strong correlation between the most polarized atomic charges of doublebonded carbons and the lowest energytransition states as expected. Intriguingly, we identified 1,3cyclohexadiene as the main example that does not follow the antiMarkovnikov rule. We proceed to show that in addition to the polarity of the double bonds within a molecule, in this case, the conjugation with the allyl double bond and the specific geometric features of the cyclohexane ring were key stabilizing factors for the unexpected transition state preference, resulting in a regioselectivity that is in quantitative agreement with previous experimental data. Our results further indicated that Reface attacks and steric factors due to substituents of the substrate influenced mainly the stereoselective outcome of the reaction, also affecting the pathways available to proceed through to complete the hydroboration process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AntiMarkovnikov rule", "Frustrated Lewis pair", "Hydroboration", "Lewis acid-base", "Markovnikov rule 11B NMR"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988660246", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57195574693": {"Name": "Hamdan L.", "AuthorID": "57195574693", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191281164": {"Name": "Abdel-Maksoud K.", "AuthorID": "57191281164", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191279561": {"Name": "Radia R.", "AuthorID": "57191279561", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57090927800": {"Name": "Boodram J.", "AuthorID": "57090927800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191283167": {"Name": "Man K.Y.", "AuthorID": "57191283167", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57089994900": {"Name": "McGregor I.", "AuthorID": "57089994900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191280948": {"Name": "Munteanu C.", "AuthorID": "57191280948", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191282279": {"Name": "Muthu K.", "AuthorID": "57191282279", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191283636": {"Name": "Poddar J.", "AuthorID": "57191283636", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191280040": {"Name": "Roberts J.", "AuthorID": "57191280040", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191283674": {"Name": "Sadler S.", "AuthorID": "57191283674", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191284794": {"Name": "Siddiqi N.", "AuthorID": "57191284794", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191275272": {"Name": "Tam S.", "AuthorID": "57191275272", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35761850100": {"Name": "Andreou A.", "AuthorID": "35761850100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6507768052": {"Name": "Scherman O.A.", "AuthorID": "6507768052", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
