However, from the number of still as yet uncloned human deafness loci and the findings of large-scale mouse mutant screens, it is clear we are still far from identifying all of the genes critical for auditory function. In particular, while we have made great progress in understanding the genetic bases of congenital and early-onset hearing loss (HL), we have only just begun to elaborate upon the genetic landscape of age-related HL. With an aging population and a growing literature suggesting links between age-related HL and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as dementia and depression, understanding the genetics and subsequently the molecular mechanisms underlying this very prevalent condition is of paramount importance. Increased knowledge of genes and molecular pathways required for hearing will ultimately provide the foundation upon which novel therapeutic approaches can be built. Here we discuss the current status of deafness genetics research and the ongoing efforts being undertaken for discovery of novel genes essential for hearing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Auditory Diseases, Central", "Deafness", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hearing", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Mice"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059777094", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6506874735": {"Name": "Bowl M.", "AuthorID": "6506874735", "AffiliationID": "118252786", "AffiliationName": "Mammalian Genetics Unit, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57206961339": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "57206961339", "AffiliationID": "118252786", "AffiliationName": "Mammalian Genetics Unit, MRC Harwell Institute"}}}
