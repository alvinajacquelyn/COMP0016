The behaviour of a system is viewed as a mapping from traces of high (unobservable) events to low (observable) events: the less the degree of dependency of low events on high traces, the more secure the system. We take the abstract view that low events are drawn from a generic semiring, where they can be combined using product and sum operations; throughout the paper, we provide instances of this framework, obtained by concrete instantiations of the underlying semiring. We specify systems via a simple process calculus, whose semantics is given as the unique homomorphism from the calculus into the set of behaviours, i.e. formal power series, seen as a final coalgebra. We provide a compositional semantics for the calculus in terms of rational operators on formal power series and show that the final and the compositional semantics coincide. This compositional, syntax-driven framework lays a foundation for automation and abstraction of a quantified approach to flow security of system specifications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compositional semantics", "Degree of dependency", "Final coalgebras", "Formal power series", "Information leakage", "Process calculi", "Reasoning about programs", "System specification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921065310", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"6701481455": {"Name": "Boreale M.", "AuthorID": "6701481455", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Statistica, Applicazioni-Univ. di Firenze"}, "57213931369": {"Name": "Clark D.", "AuthorID": "57213931369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56967136200": {"Name": "Gorla D.", "AuthorID": "56967136200", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dip. di Informatica, Univ. di Roma 'La Sapienza'"}}}
