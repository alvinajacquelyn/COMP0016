The Singaporean raters, who had exposure to various models of English and also spoke multiple L2s on a daily basis, demonstrated more lenient accent scores than the Canadian raters, who used North American English as their primary language of communication. Both of them used a similar processing strategy to make such accentedness judgements \u2013 drawing exclusively on the phonological aspects of L2 speech without taking into account the appropriate/complex use of L2 lexicogrammar.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Foreign accent", "second language pronunciation", "speech perception"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988353687", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36989820600": {"Name": "Shintani N.", "AuthorID": "36989820600", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "University of Auckland"}}}
