Considering the major investment in systems involving self-driving cars and their speedy development, their social complexity has received inadequate attention. The anticipation necessary for good governance can be informed only in part by experiments such as testing self-driving cars on open roads, and there is a need to broaden the set of issues that are considered relevant. In this paper, we report on the first systematic UK process of engagement with stakeholders. We organise the findings of these workshops in terms of questions that might inform the ongoing debate about the governance of self-driving cars. Our conclusions are that this debate urgently needs to be broadened in order to build trustworthiness and maximise the public value of this emerging technology, and that the possibilities of self-driving cars suggest the need for a more active form of governance for responsible innovation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anticipatory governance", "autonomous vehicles", "governance", "Self-driving cars", "stakeholder workshops"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052102084", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"8380913400": {"Name": "Cohen T.", "AuthorID": "8380913400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "56527289600": {"Name": "Cavoli C.", "AuthorID": "56527289600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "8243812400": {"Name": "Stilgoe J.", "AuthorID": "8243812400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
