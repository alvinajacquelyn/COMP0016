Published by Oxford University Press.The observed 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization will be distorted along the line of sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. These redshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will also make it anisotropic. This anisotropy contains information about the cross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogen field, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about the sources of reionization. In this paper, we study a collection of simulated reionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources of reionization. We show that the 21 cm anisotropy is best measured by the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum. We find that, unless the properties of the reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolves very predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. This predictability implies that redshiftspace distortions are not a very sensitive tool for distinguishing between reionization sources. However, the quadrupole moment can be used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history. We show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generation instruments such as LOFAR, while the SKA should be able to measure the reionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to great accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark ages, reionization, first stars", "Methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960830990", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"25923933600": {"Name": "Majumdar S.", "AuthorID": "25923933600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College"}, "7402097052": {"Name": "Jensen H.", "AuthorID": "7402097052", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University"}, "7004202562": {"Name": "Mellema G.", "AuthorID": "7004202562", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University"}, "57138842400": {"Name": "Lee K.", "AuthorID": "57138842400", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University"}, "55221754300": {"Name": "Chapman E.", "AuthorID": "55221754300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Electronics, Rhodes University"}, "7005749078": {"Name": "Iliev I.", "AuthorID": "7005749078", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "35185021700": {"Name": "Dixon K.", "AuthorID": "35185021700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "16400739200": {"Name": "Datta K.", "AuthorID": "16400739200", "AffiliationID": "60023609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Presidency University"}, "6603692623": {"Name": "Ciardi B.", "AuthorID": "6603692623", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik"}, "57202294429": {"Name": "Fernandez E.", "AuthorID": "57202294429", "AffiliationID": "60011173, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen"}, "24776325000": {"Name": "Jeli\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "24776325000", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Ruder Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}, "7004666481": {"Name": "Koopmans L.", "AuthorID": "7004666481", "AffiliationID": "60011173, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen"}, "7003603348": {"Name": "Zaroubi S.", "AuthorID": "7003603348", "AffiliationID": "60011173, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen"}}}
