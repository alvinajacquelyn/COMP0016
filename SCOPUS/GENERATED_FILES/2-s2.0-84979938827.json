Nearly half (45.7%) of the respondents incorrectly answered a numeracy question (low numeracy). Low numeracy respondents were less knowledgeable about colorectal cancer (p <.001), less positive towards screening (emotional, p <.001 and practical, p =.001) and less likely to intend to participate in screening (p =.001). They also reported greater defensive processing of cancer information (p =.001). Sociocognitive factors fully mediated the relationship between numeracy and screening intention. Addressing numeracy issues may reduce inequalities in CRC screening participation, but communication strategies could be limited by the tendency process cancer information defensively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes", "colorectal cancer", "health communication", "health literacy", "numeracy", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Communication", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Poverty Areas", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979938827", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"55501030300": {"Name": "Smith S.G.", "AuthorID": "55501030300", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}, "55953676400": {"Name": "Kobayashi L.C.", "AuthorID": "55953676400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "Von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35239316000": {"Name": "Wolf M.S.", "AuthorID": "35239316000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}}}
