It is unclear if this is an ancestral property that is retained in salamanders but lost in other tetrapods or if it evolved in salamanders. The three-finger protein Prod 1 is implicated in the mechanism of newt limb regeneration, and no orthologs have been found in other vertebrates, thus providing evidence for the second viewpoint. It has also been suggested that this protein could play a role in salamander-specific aspects of limb development. There are ten families of extant salamanders, and Prod 1 has only been identified in two of them to date. It is important to determine if it is present in other families and, particularly, the basal group of two families which diverged approximately 200 MYA. Findings: We have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify Prod 1 in a Chinese hynobiid species Batrachuperus longdongensis. We obtained an intestinal transcriptome of the plethodontid Aneides lugubris and, from this, identified a primer which allowed PCR of two Prod 1 genes from this species. All known Prod 1 sequences from nine species in four families have been aligned, and a phylogenetic tree has been derived. Conclusions: Prod 1 is found in basal salamanders of the family Hynobiidae, and in at least three other families, so it may be present in all extant salamanders. It remains a plausible candidate to have been involved in the origins of limb regeneration, as well as the apomorphic aspects of limb development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hynobiid", "Limb regeneration", "Phylogeny", "Plethodontid", "Three-finger protein"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927511523", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"36981588700": {"Name": "Geng J.", "AuthorID": "36981588700", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "College of Ecology and Evolution, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol"}, "9245727000": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "9245727000", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "College of Ecology and Evolution, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol"}, "7005042172": {"Name": "Gates P.", "AuthorID": "7005042172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, UCL"}, "35310884000": {"Name": "Kumar A.", "AuthorID": "35310884000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, UCL"}, "7006470776": {"Name": "Brockes J.", "AuthorID": "7006470776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, UCL"}, "56589668200": {"Name": "Guenther S.", "AuthorID": "56589668200", "AffiliationID": "60016415", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institute for Heart and Lung Research"}, "56816785100": {"Name": "Kuenne C.", "AuthorID": "56816785100", "AffiliationID": "60016415", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institute for Heart and Lung Research"}, "35503631400": {"Name": "Looso M.", "AuthorID": "35503631400", "AffiliationID": "60016415", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institute for Heart and Lung Research"}, "23970686100": {"Name": "Garza-Garcia A.", "AuthorID": "23970686100", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Medical Research"}}}
