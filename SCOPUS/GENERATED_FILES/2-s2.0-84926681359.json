Published by Oxford University Press.Interneuron dysfunction in humans is often associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Some of these disorders are believed to emerge during brain formation, at the time of interneuron specification, migration, and synapse formation. Here, using a mouse model and a host of histological and molecular biological techniques, we report that the signaling molecule cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and its activator p35, control the tangential migration of interneurons toward and within the cerebral cortex by modulating the critical neurodevelopmental signaling pathway, ErbB4/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, that has been repeatedly linked to schizophrenia. This finding identifies Cdk5 as a crucial signaling factor in cortical interneuron development in mammals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebral cortex", "interneurons", "migration", "mouse", "phosphorylation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Movement", "Cerebral Cortex", "COS Cells", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5", "GABAergic Neurons", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Interneurons", "Keratins", "Mice, Transgenic", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotransferases", "Receptor, ErbB-4", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926681359", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"8091323400": {"Name": "Raki\u0107 S.", "AuthorID": "8091323400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7402464762": {"Name": "Hunt D.", "AuthorID": "7402464762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6506636162": {"Name": "Faux C.", "AuthorID": "6506636162", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6507318934": {"Name": "Cariboni A.", "AuthorID": "6507318934", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "36112767000": {"Name": "Chiara F.", "AuthorID": "36112767000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56585121600": {"Name": "Khan S.", "AuthorID": "56585121600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006265542": {"Name": "Parnavelas J.G.", "AuthorID": "7006265542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "24402520800": {"Name": "Kanatani S.", "AuthorID": "24402520800", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, Keio University, School of Medicine"}, "7404396467": {"Name": "Nakajima K.", "AuthorID": "7404396467", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, Keio University, School of Medicine"}, "23029391000": {"Name": "Wansbury O.", "AuthorID": "23029391000", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57210641109": {"Name": "Howard B.", "AuthorID": "57210641109", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7103334650": {"Name": "Nikoli\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "7103334650", "AffiliationID": "60175990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, Imperial College School of Medicine"}}}
