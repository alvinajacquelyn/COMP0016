In this paper, data from the European Social Survey are used to explore the association between immigration and legitimacy. Starting from the assumption that police legitimacy will vary between immigrant and non-immigrant populations, we consider three distinct sets of variable that might explain such variation: contact with the police, group position and the change in frames of reference that the act of migration engenders. Findings suggest, first, that variables from all three groups predict legitimacy, with police contact emerging as the most important. Second, conditional on these factors there is no difference in the views of recent immigrants and their non-immigrant peers. However, other groups of immigrants \u2013 particularly those who migrated as children \u2013 tend to grant the police somewhat less legitimacy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["European Social Survey", "group position", "immigration", "police legitimacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046032908", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"30367516400": {"Name": "Bradford B.", "AuthorID": "30367516400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7404117113": {"Name": "Jackson J.", "AuthorID": "7404117113", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics & Political Science"}}}
