This contrasts with GPR37, which is mainly in mature oligodendrocytes. Comparison of wild type and Gpr37l1\u2013/\u2013 mice showed that loss of GPR37L1 did not affect the input resistance or resting potential of astrocytes or neurons in the hippocampus. However, GPR37L1-mediated signalling inhibited astrocyte glutamate transporters and \u2013 surprisingly, given its lack of expression in neurons \u2013 reduced neuronal NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity during prolonged activation of the receptors as occurs in ischemia. This effect on NMDAR signalling was not mediated by a change in the release of D-serine or TNF-\u03b1, two astrocyte-derived agents known to modulate NMDAR function. After middle cerebral artery occlusion, Gpr37l1 expression was increased around the lesion. Neuronal death was increased by \u223c40% in Gpr37l1\u2013/\u2013 brain compared to wild type in an in vitro model of ischemia. Thus, GPR37L1 protects neurons during ischemia, presumably by modulating extracellular glutamate concentration and NMDAR activation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gpr37l1 knockout mice", "Gpr37l1-GFP mice", "MCAO", "neuroprotection", "prosaposin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Amino Acid Transport System X-AG", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Aspartic Acid", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Exploratory Behavior", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Hippocampus", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "N-Methylaspartate", "Neurons", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Recognition (Psychology)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034060691", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35767888600": {"Name": "Jolly S.", "AuthorID": "35767888600", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "57197705620": {"Name": "Quiroga A.C.", "AuthorID": "57197705620", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "6602098570": {"Name": "Pringle N.P.", "AuthorID": "6602098570", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7202851152": {"Name": "Richardson W.D.", "AuthorID": "7202851152", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "14321864000": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "14321864000", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "55502830200": {"Name": "Bazargani N.", "AuthorID": "55502830200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006296522": {"Name": "Attwell D.", "AuthorID": "7006296522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
