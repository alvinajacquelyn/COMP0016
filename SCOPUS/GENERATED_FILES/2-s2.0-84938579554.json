The study also aimed to identify the key lifestyle behaviours associated with increased risk of the MetS and to investigate whether the MetS is associated with illness severity and degree of functional impairment. Method Baseline data were collected as part of a large randomized controlled trial (IMPaCT RCT). The study took place within community mental health teams in five Mental Health NHS Trusts in urban and rural locations across England. A total of 450 randomly selected out-patients, aged 18-65 years, with an established psychotic illness were recruited. We ascertained the prevalence rates of cardiometabolic risk factors, illness severity and functional impairment and calculated rates of the MetS, using International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel criteria. Results High rates of cardiometabolic risk factors were found. Nearly all women and most men had waist circumference exceeding the IDF threshold for central obesity. Half the sample was obese (body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2) and a fifth met the criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Females were more likely to be obese than males (61% v. 42%, p < 0.001). Of the 308 patients with complete laboratory measures, 57% (n = 175) met the IDF criteria for the MetS. Conclusions In the UK, the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with psychotic illnesses is much higher than that observed in national general population studies as well as in most international studies of patients with psychosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metabolic syndrome", "physical health", "psychotic disorder", "schizophrenia", "severe mental illnesses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Benzodiazepines", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Community Mental Health Centers", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Metabolic Syndrome X", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Rural Population", "Sex Distribution", "State Medicine", "Urban Population", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938579554", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55701629400": {"Name": "Gardner-Sood P.", "AuthorID": "55701629400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "54389354300": {"Name": "Lally J.", "AuthorID": "54389354300", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Psychosis Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603249790": {"Name": "Atakan Z.", "AuthorID": "6603249790", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Psychosis Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602336142": {"Name": "Gaughran F.", "AuthorID": "6602336142", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Biomedical Research Centre, Maudsley Hospital"}, "56120492000": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "56120492000", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102670780": {"Name": "Ismail K.", "AuthorID": "7102670780", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213123840": {"Name": "Keen A.", "AuthorID": "57213123840", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "56720101000": {"Name": "O'Brien C.", "AuthorID": "56720101000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "56720120000": {"Name": "Fung C.", "AuthorID": "56720120000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "54795661000": {"Name": "Papanastasiou E.", "AuthorID": "54795661000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "57204150152": {"Name": "Eberherd J.", "AuthorID": "57204150152", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Economics of Mental and Physical Health (CEMPH), Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "35556649600": {"Name": "Greenwood K.E.", "AuthorID": "35556649600", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Brighton and Early Intervention in Psychosis Service"}, "56720228100": {"Name": "Onagbesan O.", "AuthorID": "56720228100", "AffiliationID": "60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre - BioResource for Mental Health, Social, Genetic and Development Psychiatric Centre"}, "24496464500": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "24496464500", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "57196358874": {"Name": "Ohlsen R.", "AuthorID": "57196358874", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London"}, "56962718400": {"Name": "Stahl D.", "AuthorID": "56962718400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "57198205306": {"Name": "Hopkins D.", "AuthorID": "57198205306", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, School of Medicine"}}}
