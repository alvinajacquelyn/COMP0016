Signaling between different cells allows tissues to achieve phenotypes that no cell type can achieve in isolation. Such emergent tissue-level phenotypes can be said to \u2018supervene upon\u2019 heterocellular signaling. It is proposed here that cancer is also an emergent phenotype that supervenes upon heterocellular signaling. Using colorectal cancer (CRC) as an example, I review how heterotypic cells differentially communicate to support emergent malignancy. Studying tumors as integrated heterocellular systems \u2013 rather than as solitary expansions of mutated cells \u2013 may reveal novel ways to treat cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Communication", "Cell Lineage", "Clone Cells", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Humans", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009766732", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"36444399100": {"Name": "Tape C.", "AuthorID": "36444399100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
