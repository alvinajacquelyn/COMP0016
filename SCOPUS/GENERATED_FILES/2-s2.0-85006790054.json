Design/methodology/approach: Key concepts are drawn from the forced migration field, from social theory and from Library and information science research to frame the concept of fractured landscape research. Methodological and ethical aspects that influence research are also introduced. Findings: The importance of nomenclature is identified in relation to designations of refugee and migrant. The concept of a fractured landscape provides a suitable way of describing the disruption that is caused to refugees\u2019 information landscapes in the process of transition and resettlement. The sensitising themes such as the exilic journey, liminality, integration, bonding and bridging capital are introduced to provide a way of framing a deeper analysis of the information experience of people who must reconcile previously established ways of knowing with the new landscapes related to transition and resettlement. Originality/value: Original paper that introduces an emerging conceptual framework and a range of questions that may be useful to library and information science researchers who wish to pursue research that contributes to the humanitarian area or library services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Forced migration", "Information practices", "Information science research", "Migrants", "Public libraries", "Refugees"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006790054", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"35614004000": {"Name": "Lloyd A.", "AuthorID": "35614004000", "AffiliationID": "60033091", "AffiliationName": "Swedish School of Library and Information Science, University of Boras"}}}
