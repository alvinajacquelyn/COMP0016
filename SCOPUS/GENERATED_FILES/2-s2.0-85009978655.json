However, all variants of TSCH require some form of centralized coordination to maintain the time-frequency slotting mechanism. This leads to slow convergence to steady state and moderate time-frequency slot utilization, particularly under node churn or mobility. We propose decentralized time-synchronized channel swapping (DT-SCS), which is a novel protocol for medium access control (MAC) in ad hoc wireless networks. Under the proposed protocol, nodes first converge to synchronous beacon packet transmissions across all available channels at the physical layer, with a balanced number of nodes in each channel. This is done by the novel coupling of distributed synchronization and desynchronization mechanisms-which are based on the concept of pulse-coupled oscillators-at the MAC layer. Decentralized channel swapping can then take place via peer-to-peer swap requests/acknowledgments made between concurrent transmitters in neighboring channels. We benchmark the convergence and network throughput of DT-SCS, TSCH, and the efficient multichannel MAC protocol (seen as the state of the art in decentralized, interference-avoiding, and multichannel MAC protocols) under simulated packet losses at the MAC layer. Moreover, performance results via a Contiki-based deployment on TelosB motes reveal that DT-SCS comprises an excellent candidate for decentralized multichannel MAC-layer coordination by providing for quick convergence to steady state, high bandwidth utilization under interference and hidden nodes, as well as high connectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ad hoc networks", "channel hopping", "decentralized medium access control (MAC)", "pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ad hoc wireless networks", "Channel hopping", "Concurrent transmitters", "Convergence to steady state", "Distributed synchronization", "Medium access control(MAC)", "Multi-channel MAC protocols", "Pulse coupled oscillators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009978655", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55866291500": {"Name": "Smart G.", "AuthorID": "55866291500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57207530477": {"Name": "Andreopoulos Y.", "AuthorID": "57207530477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14026659500": {"Name": "Deligiannis N.", "AuthorID": "14026659500", "AffiliationID": "113603225", "AffiliationName": "IMinds"}, "55191557400": {"Name": "Surace R.", "AuthorID": "55191557400", "AffiliationID": "60020261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, Informatics and Systems, University of Calabria"}, "6602895297": {"Name": "Fortino G.", "AuthorID": "6602895297", "AffiliationID": "60020261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, Informatics and Systems, University of Calabria"}, "9843886600": {"Name": "Loscri V.", "AuthorID": "9843886600", "AffiliationID": "60013373", "AffiliationName": "Inria Lille-Nord Europe"}}}
