No consensus has been reached on the origin of Barrett oesophagus. Theories include a direct origin from the oesophageal-stratified squamous epithelium, or by proximal migration of the gastric cardiac epithelium with subsequent intestinalization. Variations of this theory suggest the origin is a distinctive cell at the squamocolumnar junction, the oesophageal gland ducts, or circulating bone-marrow-derived cells. Much of the supporting evidence comes from experimental models and not from studies of Barrett mucosa. In this Perspectives article, we look at the Barrett lesion itself: at its phenotype, its complexity, its clonal architecture and its stem cell organization. We conclude that Barrett glands are unique structures, but share many similarities with gastric glands undergoing the process of intestinal metaplasia. We conclude that current evidence most strongly supports an origin from stem cells in the cardia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Barrett Esophagus", "Cardia", "Cell Differentiation", "Epithelium", "Humans", "Metaplasia", "Neuroendocrine Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926164718", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"8333053900": {"Name": "McDonald S.A.C.", "AuthorID": "8333053900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57217584796": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57217584796", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7201531909": {"Name": "Wright N.A.", "AuthorID": "7201531909", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57220668111": {"Name": "Jansen M.", "AuthorID": "57220668111", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tumour Biology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
