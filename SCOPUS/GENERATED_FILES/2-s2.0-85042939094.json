In the latter, an argument is denoted as a pair displaying a reason and a conclusion but no condition is required to hold relating the reason to the conclusion. We introduce a series of inference rules relating arguments and show how the resulting system captures important features of argumentation that hitherto have not been captured by existing formalisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argumentation", "arguments", "claims", "reasons", "rejections"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042939094", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Logic", "MATH", "2609"]], "AuthorData": {"6603218257": {"Name": "Amgoud L.", "AuthorID": "6603218257", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, IRIT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "57191630413": {"Name": "Besnard P.", "AuthorID": "57191630413", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60008134, 60030491", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, IRIT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
