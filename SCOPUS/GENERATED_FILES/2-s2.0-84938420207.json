In the UK, for example, it is estimated that over 300,000 missing persons incidents are recorded by the police each year which means that a person in the UK is recorded missing by the police approximately every two minutes. However, there is a complex web of behaviours that surround the phenomenon of missing persons which can make it difficult to establish whether someone's disappearance is \u2018intentional\u2019 or \u2018unintentional\u2019 or whether they might be at risk of harm from themselves or others. Drawing on a set of missing person case reconstructions and interviews with the officers involved with these cases, this paper provides insights into the different stages of the investigative process and some of the key influences which shape the trajectory of a missing person's investigation. In particular, it highlights the complex interplay between actions which are \u2018ordered and conditioned\u2019 by a procedural discourse around how missing persons investigations should be conducted, and the narratives that officers construct about how they approach investigations which are often shaped by a mix of police craft, \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018reputational\u2019 issues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["investigation", "missing persons", "policing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938420207", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"6701801867": {"Name": "Fyfe N.", "AuthorID": "6701801867", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Institute for Policing Research, School of the Environment, University of Dundee"}, "56020579200": {"Name": "Woolnough P.", "AuthorID": "56020579200", "AffiliationID": "114171948", "AffiliationName": "Police Scotland"}, "36785569300": {"Name": "Stevenson O.", "AuthorID": "36785569300", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
