Aim: To explore GPs views on and expectations regarding pain management in children with AOM, and how a multifaceted educational intervention aimed at optimising pain management shapes these perceptions. Design & setting: Qualitative study conducted alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT), the PIMPOM study, in the Netherlands. Method: Twelve GPs were purposefully sampled from primary care centres allocated to the intervention group and were interviewed, using semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews. The inte vention comprised a blended GP educational programme (internet-based and face-to-face training) aimed at discussing pain management proactively with parents using a parent information leaflet, and prescribing paracetamol and ibuprofen according to current guidelines. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically by a multidisciplinary team. Results: GPs considered AOM a very painful condition. Initially, GPs felt unable to offer adequate treatment for AOM-related ear pain. The intervention provided tools, such as knowledge, communication skills, and an information leaflet, which reduced their feelings of helplessness and empowered them to manage childhood AOM more adequately. GPs indicated that the intervention led to a shift in focus from treating the infection with antibiotics to treating symptoms with analgesics. There was a general lack of knowledge about the possibility of prescribing ibuprofen to children. GPs expressed mixed views on prescribing this drug to children. Conclusion: A primary-care based multifaceted educational intervention aimed at optimising pain management in childhood AOM offered GPs tools to optimise management of this condition and changed GPs perceptions, namely from treating the infection with antibiotics to treating symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute otitis media", "Otitis media", "Pain management", "Primary health care", "Qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060599992", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"57215713659": {"Name": "Uum R.T.v.", "AuthorID": "57215713659", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "54793507200": {"Name": "Sjoukes A.", "AuthorID": "54793507200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "24345784200": {"Name": "Venekamp R.P.", "AuthorID": "24345784200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7007062761": {"Name": "Schilder A.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7007062761", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "57215713575": {"Name": "Groot E.d.", "AuthorID": "57215713575", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7004739501": {"Name": "Damoiseaux R.A.M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004739501", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "18436163600": {"Name": "Anthierens S.", "AuthorID": "18436163600", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Interdisciplinary Care, Antwerp University"}}}
