Unlike the central nervous system, neurons of the peripheral nervous system have a greater ability to regenerate. However, due to a number of confounding factors, this is often both incomplete and inadequate. The lack of supportive Schwann cells or their inability to maintain a regenerative phenotype is a major factor. Advances in nervous system tissue engineering technology have led to efforts to build Schwann cell scaffolds to overcome this and enhance the regenerative capacity of neurons following injury. Stem cells that can differentiate along a neural lineage represent an essential resource and starting material for this process. In this review, we discuss the different stem cell types that are showing promise for nervous system tissue engineering in the context of peripheral nerve injury. We also discuss some of the biological, practical, ethical, and commercial considerations in using these different stem cells for future clinical application.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973137600", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57189496597": {"Name": "Bhangra K.", "AuthorID": "57189496597", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "56568214300": {"Name": "Busuttil F.", "AuthorID": "56568214300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "14045774100": {"Name": "Rahim A.", "AuthorID": "14045774100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
