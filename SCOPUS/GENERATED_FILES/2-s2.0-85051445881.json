In this review, we survey the latest developments in nonlinear plasmonics in three-dimensional (metallic) and two-dimensional (graphene) nanostructures and offer an outlook on future developments in this field of research. In particular, we discuss the main theoretical concepts, experimental methods, and computational tools that are used together in modern nonlinear plasmonics to explore in an integrated manner nonlinear optical properties of metallic and graphene based nanostructures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational electromagnetics", "metasurfaces", "nonlinear plasmonics", "optical devices", "surface optics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Development and testing", "Light-matter interactions", "Metasurfaces", "Near field optical microscopy", "Non-linear optical properties", "Nonlinear plasmonics", "Plasmonic nanostructures", "Surface optics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051445881", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "35490772400": {"Name": "Lei D.Y.", "AuthorID": "35490772400", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}, "56115065600": {"Name": "Li G.C.", "AuthorID": "56115065600", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}}}
