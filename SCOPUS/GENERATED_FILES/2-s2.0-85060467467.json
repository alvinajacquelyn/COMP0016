KGaA, WeinheimThe front cover artwork is provided by the group of Prof. D. Flemming Hansen at University College London. The cover illustrates a new NMR method to characterise functional interactions formed by arginine side-chains. A free side-chain (fast exchange) and one engaged in a salt-bridge (slow exchange) are shown.
