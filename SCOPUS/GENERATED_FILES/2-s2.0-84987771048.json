All rights reserved.The cut pseudo-metric on the space of graph limits induces an equivalence relation. The quotient space obtained by collapsing each equivalence class to a point is a metric space with appealing analytic properties. We show the equivalence relation admits a Borel lifting: There exists a Borel-measurable mapping that maps each equivalence class to one of its elements. The result yields a general framework for proving measurability properties on the space of graph limits. We give several examples, including Borel-measurability of the set of isomorphism classes of random-free graphons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graph limits", "Random graphs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987771048", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"14036190400": {"Name": "Orbanz P.", "AuthorID": "14036190400", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "6602384678": {"Name": "Szegedy B.", "AuthorID": "6602384678", "AffiliationID": "60007752", "AffiliationName": "Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics"}}}
