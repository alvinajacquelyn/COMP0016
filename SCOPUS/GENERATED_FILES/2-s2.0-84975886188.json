It has been recently shown that it can be simply and scalably co-polymerised, by \u201cinverse vulcanisation\u201d with organic crosslinkers. The properties of porous carbons, which have extensive uses in science and industry, are influenced by the materials from which they are generated. Reported here are the first examples of porous carbons produced from high-sulfur inverse vulcanised polymers. The materials produced show micro-porosity, gas selectivity, and are doped with sulfur. The simplicity of the technique, and wide range of other potential inverse vulcanised feedstocks, gives scope for transferability and control of properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gas separation", "Inverse vulcanisation", "Microporous", "Porous carbon", "Sulfur"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-linkers", "Elemental sulfur", "Gas selectivity", "Gas separations", "Industrial by-products", "Microporous", "Porous carbons", "Vulcanisation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975886188", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London 20 Gordon Street"}, "15053182500": {"Name": "Dunnill C.", "AuthorID": "15053182500", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy Safety Research Institute (ESRI), College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus"}, "57192900304": {"Name": "McGettrick J.", "AuthorID": "57192900304", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "SPECIFIC, College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London 20 Gordon Street"}, "21742382600": {"Name": "Hasell T.", "AuthorID": "21742382600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool"}}}
