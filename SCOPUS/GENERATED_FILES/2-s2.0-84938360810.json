Design, setting and participants Between 2010 and 2012, we did a probability sample survey of 15 162 men and women aged 16-74 years in Britain. Urine from participants aged 16-44 years reporting \u22651 lifetime sexual partner was tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis using the Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) assay, with positive or equivocal results confirmed with molecular assays using different nucleic acid targets. Results A total of 4550 participants aged 16-44 years had urine test results (1885 men; 2665 women). For gonorrhoea, 18 samples initially tested positive and eight were equivocal. Only five out of 26 confirmed, giving a positive predictive value (PPV) for the initial testing of 19% (95% CI 4% to 34%). Most (86% (18/21)) participants with unconfirmed positive results for gonorrhoea reported zero or one sexual partner without condoms in the past year and none had chlamydia co-infection, whereas all five with confirmed gonorrhoea reported at least two recent sexual partners without condoms, and four had chlamydia co-infection. The weighted prevalence for gonorrhoea positivity fell from 0.4% (0.3% to 0.7%) after initial screening to <0.1% (0.0% to 0.1%) after confirmatory testing. By comparison, 103 samples tested positive or equivocal for chlamydia and 98 were confirmed (PPV=95% (91% to 99%)). Conclusions We highlight the low PPV for gonorrhoea of an unconfirmed reactive test when deploying molecular testing in a low-prevalence population. Failure to undertake confirmatory testing in low-prevalence settings may lead to inappropriate diagnoses, unnecessary treatment and overestimation of population prevalence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Chlamydia Infections", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Female", "Gonorrhea", "Great Britain", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques", "Population Surveillance", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Sexual Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938360810", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen Social Research"}, "24069384200": {"Name": "Tanton C.", "AuthorID": "24069384200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55617668400": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "55617668400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "8668568000": {"Name": "Alexander S.", "AuthorID": "8668568000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "35592025300": {"Name": "Ison C.A.", "AuthorID": "35592025300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control"}, "6701456519": {"Name": "Soldan K.", "AuthorID": "6701456519", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control"}, "6601961353": {"Name": "Beddows S.", "AuthorID": "6601961353", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "37003576900": {"Name": "Da Silva F.C.", "AuthorID": "37003576900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
