ACMFreehand sketching is a valuable process, input, output, and tool, often used by people to communicate and express ideas, as well as document, explore and describe concepts between researcher, user, or client. Sketches are fast, easy to create, and - by varying their fidelity - can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drawing", "HCI", "Sketching", "Visual Thinking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Freehand sketching", "Sketching", "Visual thinking"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067275489", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"18437606000": {"Name": "Lewis M.", "AuthorID": "18437606000", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University London"}, "57188759450": {"Name": "Sturdee M.", "AuthorID": "57188759450", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
