The newt provides an excellent model in which to explore regeneration and whilst loss of hair cells from inner ear epithelia does not require whole organ regeneration, new hair cells are generated from differentiated supporting cells that transdifferentiate without an intervening mitotic event. Here we describe the methods for maintaining the sensory epithelia in long term culture; for the use of the aminoglycoside, gentamicin, to kill the hair cells; and for the examination of the tissue by electron microscopy or fl uorescence microscopy. Demembranation of the epithelium reveals the underlying ultrastructure of the tissue for examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and is a technique that can be utilized with immunogold labelling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hair cell", "Notophthalmus viridescens", "Saccule", "Salamander", "Stereocilia", "Utricle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Epithelium", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gold", "Hair Cells, Auditory", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Regeneration", "Salamandridae", "Staining and Labeling", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924365801", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"8233631400": {"Name": "Taylor R.R.", "AuthorID": "8233631400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
