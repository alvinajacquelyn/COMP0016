Although chest pain is a classical symptom, a significant proportion of patients do not present with chest pain. The impact of a non-chest pain (NCP) presentation on ED processes-of-care and outcomes is not fully understood. We utilised a national registry to characterise predictors, processes-of-care, and outcomes of NCP STEMI presentations. Retrospective data for all STEMI cases occurring between 2010 and 2012 were analysed from the Singapore Myocardial Infarction Registry. Cases of inpatient onset, inter-facility transfers, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were excluded. Univariable analysis of demographic, clinical, processes-of-care, and outcome variables was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression ascertained independent predictors of a NCP presentation and 28-day mortality. Of 4667 STEMI cases, 12.9% presented without chest pain. Patients with NCP presentation were older (median, years = 74 vs. 58; p < 0.001), more likely to be female (39.1% vs. 15.7%; p < 0.001), of the Chinese race (72.5% vs. 62.7%; p < 0.001), and with diabetes (48.6% vs. 36.7%; p < 0.001). These patients were more likely to present with syncope (6.0% vs. 1.9%; p < 0.001) or epigastric pain (10.6% vs. 4.9%; p < 0.001). Patients with NCP presentation were less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention (27.0% vs. 75.6%; p < 0.001), had longer door-to-balloon time (median, minutes = 83 vs. 63; p < 0.001), and experienced greater mortality at 28 days (31.2% vs. 4.5%; p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, independent predictors of a NCP presentation included age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04\u20131.07), diabetes (aOR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.40\u20132.19), BMI (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.91\u20130.96), and dyslipidemia (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.58\u20130.91). Absence of chest pain was an independent predictor for 28-day mortality (aOR = 3.46, 95% CI 2.64\u20134.52). Patients who presented with a NCP STEMI had a distinct clinical profile and experienced poorer outcomes. Routine triage ECG could be considered for patients with high-risk factors and non-classical symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute myocardial infarction", "Atypical presentation", "Chest pain", "Door to balloon", "Painless", "ST-elevation myocardial infarction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Singapore", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Statistics, Nonparametric"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067258182", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"]], "AuthorData": {"57209004109": {"Name": "Pong J.Z.", "AuthorID": "57209004109", "AffiliationID": "60017161, 60095034", "AffiliationName": "Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore"}, "7006449334": {"Name": "Ong M.E.H.", "AuthorID": "7006449334", "AffiliationID": "60078609", "AffiliationName": "Health Service Research Centre, Singapore Health Services"}, "55701539100": {"Name": "Ho A.F.W.", "AuthorID": "55701539100", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60007966", "AffiliationName": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, Centro de Biotecnologia-FEMSA"}, "57184817600": {"Name": "Tan T.X.Z.", "AuthorID": "57184817600", "AffiliationID": "60078609", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Medicine Residency Program, SingHealth Services"}, "56844093200": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "56844093200", "AffiliationID": "60095107", "AffiliationName": "National Registry of Diseases Office, Health Promotion Board"}, "36706606000": {"Name": "Pek P.P.", "AuthorID": "36706606000", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Singapore General Hospital"}, "57189870044": {"Name": "Sia C.H.", "AuthorID": "57189870044", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre"}}}
