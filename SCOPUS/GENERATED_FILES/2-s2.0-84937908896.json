The NW physical dimensions are determined for optimized solar energy absorption and current matching between each subcell. Two key factors (minority carrier lifetime, surface recombination velocity) affecting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell are highlighted, and a practical guideline to design high-efficiency two-junction solar cell is thus provided. Considering the practical surface and bulk defects in GaInP semiconductor, a promising PCE of 27.5 % can be obtained. The results depict the usefulness of integrating NWs to construct high-efficiency multi-junction III\u2013V solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Current matching", "Nanowire", "Photovoltaics", "Two-junction solar cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current matching", "Electrical simulation", "Minority carrier lifetimes", "Photovoltaics", "Physical dimensions", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Practical guidelines", "Surface recombination velocities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937908896", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57215437981": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57215437981", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Anhui University"}, "37017831000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "37017831000", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Anhui University"}, "35114359100": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "35114359100", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Anhui University"}, "16319047400": {"Name": "He S.", "AuthorID": "16319047400", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Anhui University"}, "56104533100": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56104533100", "AffiliationID": "60024737, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Material Physics, Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
