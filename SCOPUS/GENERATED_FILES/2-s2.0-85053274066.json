American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The level of lava within a volcanic conduit reflects the overpressure within a connected magma reservoir. Continuous monitoring of lava level can therefore provide critical insights into volcanic processes and aid hazard assessment. However, accurate measurements of lava level are not easy to make, partly owing to the often dense fumes that hinder optical techniques. Here we present the first radar instrument designed for the purpose of monitoring lava level and report on its successful operation at Erebus volcano, Antarctica. We describe the hardware and data-processing steps followed to extract a time series of lava lake level, demonstrating that we can readily resolve \u223c1 m cyclic variations in lake level that have previously been recognized at Erebus volcano. The performance of the radar (continuous, automated data collection in temperatures of around \u221230 \u00b0C) indicates the suitability of this approach for sustained automated measurements at Erebus and other volcanoes with lava lakes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["active lava lake", "Erebus", "FMCW", "radar"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate measurement", "Automated data collection", "Automated measurement", "Continuous monitoring", "Erebus", "FMCW", "Hazard Assessment", "Optical technique"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053274066", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"35220363000": {"Name": "Peters N.J.", "AuthorID": "35220363000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "7005631653": {"Name": "Oppenheimer C.", "AuthorID": "7005631653", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57198996462": {"Name": "Lok L.B.", "AuthorID": "57198996462", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36185201600": {"Name": "Ash M.", "AuthorID": "36185201600", "AffiliationID": "60111377", "AffiliationName": "PA Consulting Group, Global Innovation and Technology Centre"}, "7006728944": {"Name": "Kyle P.", "AuthorID": "7006728944", "AffiliationID": "60028844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology"}}}
