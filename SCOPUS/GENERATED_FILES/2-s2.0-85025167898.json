However, TRAIL has the capacity to bind to regulatory receptors in addition to death-inducing receptors; their differential roles in liver fibrosis have not been investigated. Here we have dissected the contribution of regulatory TRAIL receptors to apoptosis resistance in primary human hepatic stellate cells (hHSC). hHSC isolated from healthy margins of liver resections from different donors expressed variable levels of TRAIL-R2/3/4 (but negligible TRAIL-R1) ex vivo and after activation. The apoptotic potential of TRAIL-R2 on hHSC was confirmed by lentiviral-mediated knockdown. A functional inhibitory role for TRAIL-R3/4 was revealed by shRNA knockdown and mAb blockade, showing that these regulatory receptors limit apoptosis of hHSC in response to both oligomerised TRAIL and NK cells. A close inverse ex vivo correlation between hHSC TRAIL-R4 expression and susceptibility to apoptosis underscored its central regulatory role. Our data provide the first demonstration of non-redundant functional roles for the regulatory TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R3/4) in a physiological setting. The potential for these inhibitory TRAIL receptors to protect hHSC from apoptosis opens new avenues for prognostic and therapeutic approaches to the management of liver fibrosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Apoptosis", "Cells, Cultured", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Liver", "Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025167898", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56290146100": {"Name": "Singh H.D.", "AuthorID": "56290146100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, UCL"}, "15127978400": {"Name": "Otano I.", "AuthorID": "15127978400", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "55574201314": {"Name": "Singh K.P.", "AuthorID": "55574201314", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University"}, "24171517900": {"Name": "Peppa D.", "AuthorID": "24171517900", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "6603058561": {"Name": "Rombouts K.", "AuthorID": "6603058561", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, UCL"}, "57194495870": {"Name": "B\u00f6ttcher K.", "AuthorID": "57194495870", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, UCL"}, "6602606185": {"Name": "Oben J.", "AuthorID": "6602606185", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, UCL"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, UCL"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.M.C.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, UCL"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer, and Inflammation, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "55934460700": {"Name": "Gill U.S.", "AuthorID": "55934460700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, QMUL"}, "57196075608": {"Name": "Kennedy P.T.F.", "AuthorID": "57196075608", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, QMUL"}}}
