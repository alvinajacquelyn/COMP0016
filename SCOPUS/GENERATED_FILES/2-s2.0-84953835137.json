Methods: Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate time-lagged associations between structural and functional measures of social relationships and QoL assessed 5 years apart by CASP-19, in 5925 Whitehall II participants (mean age 61, SD 6.0). Chronic disease was clinically verified coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes or cancer. Results: Social relationships\u2013QoL associations were consistent across disease status (P-values for interaction: 0.15\u20130.99). Larger friend network (\u03b2 = 1.9, 95 % CI 1.5\u20132.3), having a partner (\u03b2 = 1.2, 95 % CI 0.5\u20131.7), higher confiding support (\u03b2 = 2.2, 95 % CI 1.8\u20132.7) and lower negative aspects of close relationships (\u03b2 = 3.3, 95 % CI 2.8\u20133.8) were independently related to improved QoL in old age. The estimated difference in QoL due to social relationships was equivalent to up to 0.5 SD of the CASP-19 score and was stronger than the effect of chronic disease (coronary heart disease \u03b2 = 2.0, 95 % CI 1.4\u20132.6). Conclusions: We found that beneficial aspects of social relationships in relation to QoL were, in order of importance: avoiding negative aspects of close relationships, having confiding support, having a wide network of friends and having a partner. These associations were not modified by chronic disease. Thus, despite inevitable physical deterioration, we may be able to enhance a satisfying late life by optimizing our social relationships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Chronic disease", "Quality of life", "Social relationships"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Chronic Disease", "Coronary Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Quality of Life", "Social Support", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953835137", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55991650500": {"Name": "Liao J.", "AuthorID": "55991650500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}}}
