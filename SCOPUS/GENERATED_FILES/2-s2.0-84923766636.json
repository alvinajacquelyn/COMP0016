This is based on the Brown-Michael model for two-dimensional vortex shedding, which is adapted to more realistically model mesoscale oceanic flow by including a deforming free surface. With a free surface, the streamfunction for the flow is not harmonic so the conformal mapping methods used in the standard Brown-Michael approach cannot be used and the problem must be solved numerically. A numerical scheme is developed based on a Chebyshev spectral method for the streamfunction partial differential equation and a second order implicit timestepping scheme for the vortex position ordinary differntial equations. This method is used to compute shed vortex trajectories for three background flows: (A) a steady flow around a semi-infinite plate, (B) a free vortex moving around a semi-infinite plate, and (C) a free vortex moving around a right-angled wedge. In (A), the inclusion of surface deformation dramatically slows the vortex and changes its trajectory from a straight path to a curved one. In (B) and (C), without the inclusion of flow separation, free vortices traverse fully around the tip along symmetrical trajectories. With the effects of flow separation included, very different trajectories are found: for all values of the model parameter-the Rossby radius-the free and shed vortices pair up and move off to infinity without passing around the tip. Their final propagation angle depends strongly and monotonically on the Rossby radius.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chebyshev spectral methods", "Conformal mapping method", "Mesoscale oceanic flows", "Point vortex models", "Propagation angle", "Semi-infinite plate", "Surface deformation", "Time-stepping schemes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923766636", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56532144600": {"Name": "Southwick O.R.", "AuthorID": "56532144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57189658000": {"Name": "Johnson E.R.", "AuthorID": "57189658000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "56846884500": {"Name": "McDonald N.R.", "AuthorID": "56846884500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
