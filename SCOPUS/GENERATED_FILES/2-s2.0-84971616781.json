Before badges, less than 3% of Psychological Science articles reported open data. After badges, 23% reported open data, with an accelerating trend; 39% reported open data in the first half of 2015, an increase of more than an order of magnitude from baseline. There was no change over time in the low rates of data sharing among comparison journals. Moreover, reporting openness does not guarantee openness. When badges were earned, reportedly available data were more likely to be actually available, correct, usable, and complete than when badges were not earned. Open materials also increased to a weaker degree, and there was more variability among comparison journals. Badges are simple, effective signals to promote open practices and improve preservation of data and materials by using independent repositories.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Information Dissemination", "Internet", "Psychology", "Publishing", "Serial Publications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971616781", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56810922300": {"Name": "Kidwell M.C.", "AuthorID": "56810922300", "AffiliationID": "113987382", "AffiliationName": "Center for Open Science"}, "8088102500": {"Name": "Errington T.M.", "AuthorID": "8088102500", "AffiliationID": "113987382", "AffiliationName": "Center for Open Science"}, "6602443500": {"Name": "Nosek B.A.", "AuthorID": "6602443500", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "24481691500": {"Name": "Lazarevi\u0107 L.B.", "AuthorID": "24481691500", "AffiliationID": "60068815", "AffiliationName": "University of Belgrade"}, "56624454000": {"Name": "Baranski E.", "AuthorID": "56624454000", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "University of California, Riverside"}, "55937009200": {"Name": "Hardwicke T.E.", "AuthorID": "55937009200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57216564503": {"Name": "Piechowski S.", "AuthorID": "57216564503", "AffiliationID": "60025697", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods"}, "57189525970": {"Name": "Falkenberg L.S.", "AuthorID": "57189525970", "AffiliationID": "60025697", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods"}, "54881099700": {"Name": "Fiedler S.", "AuthorID": "54881099700", "AffiliationID": "60025697", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods"}, "57189518055": {"Name": "Kennett C.", "AuthorID": "57189518055", "AffiliationID": "60001526", "AffiliationName": "Mississippi State University"}, "57189516753": {"Name": "Hess-Holden C.", "AuthorID": "57189516753", "AffiliationID": "60001526", "AffiliationName": "Mississippi State University"}, "56810824900": {"Name": "Slowik A.", "AuthorID": "56810824900", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "University of Vienna"}, "56811403700": {"Name": "Sonnleitner C.", "AuthorID": "56811403700", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "University of Vienna"}}}
