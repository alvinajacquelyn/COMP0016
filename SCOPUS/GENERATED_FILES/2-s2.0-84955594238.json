I trace these developments and assess the extent to which these diverse elements share properties that distinguish them from concept-expressing words. While the notion of procedural encoding has lost some of its original distinctiveness, it may make sense to think of all encoded meaning as procedural (including the meaning of concept-expressing words), but this necessitates the drawing of new clarifying distinctions among kinds of procedural meaning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concepts", "Discourse connectives", "Expressives", "Meaning modulation", "Procedural meaning", "Relevance theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955594238", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"6602539659": {"Name": "Carston R.", "AuthorID": "6602539659", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature (CSMN), University of Oslo"}}}
