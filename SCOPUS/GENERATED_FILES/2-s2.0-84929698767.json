This study used MOT to investigate the effect of object-based grouping, both in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A modified MOT task was administered to both groups, who had to track and distinguish four targets that moved randomly amongst four distracters, irrespective of the grouping condition. No group difference was revealed between children with and without ASD: both showed adequate MOT abilities and a similar amount of grouping interference. Implications of the current result are considered for previous MOT studies, the developmental trajectory of perceptual grouping, and the idea of heightened sensitivity to task characteristics in ASD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)", "Grouping", "Interference", "Multiple object tracking (MOT)", "Vision research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929698767", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"55983212400": {"Name": "Van der Hallen R.", "AuthorID": "55983212400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven"}, "36971177400": {"Name": "Evers K.", "AuthorID": "36971177400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven"}, "22984662400": {"Name": "de-Wit L.", "AuthorID": "22984662400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, KU Leuven"}, "7006148651": {"Name": "Wagemans J.", "AuthorID": "7006148651", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven"}, "35312655400": {"Name": "Steyaert J.", "AuthorID": "35312655400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven"}, "8746100600": {"Name": "Noens I.", "AuthorID": "8746100600", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital"}}}
