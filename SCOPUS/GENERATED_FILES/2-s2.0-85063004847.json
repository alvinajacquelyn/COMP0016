These continuous bioprocesses are more failure-prone and process failure is more consequential. In addition, the probability of failure is dependent on process run time which generally is determined independent of scheduling considerations. This work presents a discrete-event simulation of continuous bioprocesses in a scheduling environment. Dynamic scheduling policies are investigated to make operational decisions in a multi-product manufacturing facility and react to process failure events and uncertain demand. First, different scheduling policies are adapted from the stochastic lot sizing literature and a novel look-ahead scheduling policy is proposed. Then, policy parameters (including process run time) are tuned using evolutionary algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the tuned policies perform much better than a policy that estimates policy parameters based on service level considerations and a policy based on a fixed cyclical sequence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopharmaceutical manufacture", "Hyper-heuristics", "Machine failure", "Perfusion", "Simulation optimisation", "Stochastic economic lot scheduling problem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopharmaceutical manufacture", "Economic lot scheduling problems", "Hyper-heuristics", "Machine failure", "Perfusion", "Simulation optimisation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063004847", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57194336217": {"Name": "Oyebolu F.", "AuthorID": "57194336217", "AffiliationID": "60115484, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Business School, University of Warwick"}, "12242356900": {"Name": "Branke J.", "AuthorID": "12242356900", "AffiliationID": "60115484, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Business School, University of Warwick"}, "36615062500": {"Name": "Allmendinger R.", "AuthorID": "36615062500", "AffiliationID": "60026051, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Alliance Manchester Business School, The University of Manchester"}, "7005343335": {"Name": "Farid S.", "AuthorID": "7005343335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
