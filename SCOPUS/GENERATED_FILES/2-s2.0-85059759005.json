We evaluated the clinical impact of LGE CMR incorporating a device-dependent metal artifact reduction strategy in patients with CIEDs. Methods: 136 CMR studies were performed in 133 consecutive patients (age 56 \u00b1 19 years, 69% male) with CIEDs (22% implantable loop recorders [ILRs], 40% permanent pacemakers [PPMs], 38% implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs]; 42% non-MRI conditional) over 2 years, without complication. LGE imaging was tailored to the CIED, using a wideband sequence for left-sided PPMs and ICDs and conventional sequences for ILRs and right-sided PPMs, scoring segmental artifact. Diagnostic utility and impact on clinical management were scored by consensus of experts. Results: CMR provided unexpected diagnoses in 22 (16%) and changed management in 113 (83%) patients. Myocardial scar was present in 92 (68%), with other abnormalities detected in another 13%. Using conventional LGE, 43 (32%) studies were non-diagnostic (79% of defibrillators) compared to 0% using wideband LGE imaging. Wideband LGE results changed clinical management in an additional 39 (75%) defibrillator patients and 10 (19%) pacemaker patients when compared to imaging with conventional LGE sequences. Conclusion: The clinical yield from CMR using optimized LGE sequences in patients with CIEDs is high with no demonstrated clinical risk. A device-dependent LGE imaging strategy using wideband LGE is needed to achieve clinical utility especially in ICD recipients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "Defibrillator", "Fibrosis", "Late gadolinium enhancement", "Pacemaker", "Wideband"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cicatrix", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Pacemaker, Artificial", "Random Allocation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059759005", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"34970790200": {"Name": "Bhuva A.", "AuthorID": "34970790200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56786381300": {"Name": "Ramlall M.", "AuthorID": "56786381300", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56108683100": {"Name": "Boubertakh R.", "AuthorID": "56108683100", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57205366788": {"Name": "Feuchter P.", "AuthorID": "57205366788", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6602338209": {"Name": "Sekhri N.", "AuthorID": "6602338209", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health"}, "57196246415": {"Name": "Graham A.", "AuthorID": "57196246415", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57205360206": {"Name": "Hawkins A.", "AuthorID": "57205360206", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7202196645": {"Name": "Lowe M.", "AuthorID": "7202196645", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7201390233": {"Name": "Schilling R.", "AuthorID": "7201390233", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
