This paper presents an approach and tools, created by a London-based company called Performance Learning Education (PL), for supporting front-line teachers and learners in developing metacognitive competencies. An iterative process adopted by PL in developing and validating its approach is presented, demonstrating its value to real educational practices, it\u2019s research potential in the area of metacognition, and its AI readiness, especially in relation to modelling learners\u2019 non-cognitive competencies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Formal education", "Iterative process", "Metacognition", "Metacognitives", "On-line analysis", "Professional development", "Research potential"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022174391", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57194786000": {"Name": "Samani T.", "AuthorID": "57194786000", "AffiliationID": "118787827", "AffiliationName": "Performance Learning Education"}, "7801505406": {"Name": "Porayska-Pomsta K.", "AuthorID": "7801505406", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "35608174500": {"Name": "Luckin R.", "AuthorID": "35608174500", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
