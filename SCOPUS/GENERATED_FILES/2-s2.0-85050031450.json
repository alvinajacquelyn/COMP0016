Clinical guidelines recommend carbamazepine (only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for TN) and oxcarbazepine as first-line therapies. We utilized the US Truven Health MarketScan database to examine treatment patterns among patients with TN. Methods: Included patients were aged 18 years and above, newly diagnosed with TN (\u22652 TN diagnoses \u226514 days apart; no diagnosis in the previous year), continuously enrolled 1 year before index, with \u22653 years' follow-up postindex. We assessed utilization of selected pharmacotherapies (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, gabapentin, baclofen, duloxetine, topiramate), surgery (posterior fossa, radiosurgery), and injections (peripheral anesthetic injections, Gasserian ganglion procedures) for TN. Results: In total, 3685 patients were included (2425 commercial, 1260 Medicare; 71.8% female; age, mean [SD], 59 [15] y). Overall, 72.5% of patients received at least 1 studied medication, most commonly carbamazepine (51.7%) or gabapentin (48.6%). In total, 65% of pharmacologically treated patients had \u22652 treatment episodes; 41.6% had \u22653 (defined by a change in pharmacotherapy [monotherapy/combination] regimen). Overall, 12.3% had surgery and 7.3% injections; 42.9% received opioids for TN. Conclusions: In the 3 years after diagnosis, patients with TN in the United States receive a variety of pharmacological treatments, including opioids, despite carbamazepine being the only approved medication. A notable proportion utilize surgeries/injections. A high proportion of pharmacologically treated patients receive multiple treatment episodes, suggesting frequent therapy switching, perhaps because of suboptimal efficacy/tolerability. Our data suggest a high burden of illness associated with TN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["claims analysis", "pharmacological treatment", "surgery", "treatment patterns", "trigeminal neuralgia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Analgesics", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Trigeminal Neuralgia", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050031450", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"7006163624": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006163624", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Facial Pain Unit and Pain Management Centre, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "57202972631": {"Name": "Wu N.", "AuthorID": "57202972631", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "57189490249": {"Name": "Werneburg B.", "AuthorID": "57189490249", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "57210742257": {"Name": "Hoffman D.", "AuthorID": "57210742257", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "57202970363": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57202970363", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "57190386875": {"Name": "Lee J.Y.K.", "AuthorID": "57190386875", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
