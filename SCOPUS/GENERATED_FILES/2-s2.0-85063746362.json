Objective: We sought to investigate immunologic mechanisms of LPP immunotherapy in a subset of patients who participated in a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (clinical.gov NCT02560948). Methods: Participants were randomized to receive LPP (n = 21) or placebo (n = 11) for 3 weeks over 4 visits. Grass pollen\u2013induced basophil, T-cell, and B-cell responses were evaluated before treatment (visit [V] 2), at the end of treatment (V6), and after the pollen season (V8). Results: Combined symptom and rescue medication scores (CSMS) were lower during the peak pollen season (\u221235.1%, P =.03) and throughout the pollen season (\u221253.7%, P =.03) in the LPP-treated group compared with those in the placebo-treated group. Proportions of CD63+ and CD203cbrightCRTH2+ basophils were decreased following LPP treatment at V6 (10 ng/mL, P <.0001) and V8 (10 ng/mL, P <.001) compared to V2. No change in the placebo-treated group was observed. Blunting of seasonal increases in levels of grass pollen\u2013specific IgE was observed in LPP-treated but not placebo-treated group. LPP immunotherapy, but not placebo, was associated with a reduction in proportions of IL-4+ TH2 (V6, P =.02), IL-4+ (V6, P =.003; V8, P =.004), and IL-21+ (V6, P =.003; V8, P =.002) follicular helper T cells. Induction of FoxP3+, follicular regulatory T, and IL-10+ regulatory B cells were observed at V6 (all P <.05) and V8 (all P <.05) in LPP-treated group. Induction of regulatory B cells was associated with allergen-neutralizing IgG4-blocking antibodies. Conclusion: For the first time, we demonstrate that the immunologic mechanisms of LPP immunotherapy are underscored by immune modulation in the T- and B-cell compartments, which is necessary for its effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allergy", "follicular helper T cells", "peptide immunotherapy", "regulatory B cells", "regulatory T cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Allergens", "Asthma",
