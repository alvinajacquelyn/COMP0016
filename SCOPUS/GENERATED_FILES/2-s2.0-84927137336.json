Although monovacancies can act as traps for H impurities or OH groups, the calculations show that two vacancies only weakly bind with each other and this interaction terminates at the third nearest-neighbor distance. An interstitial P tends to form a Cu-P dumbbell-like cluster around the lattice site and can readily combine with a vacancy to become a substitutional impurity. It is also found that the intrinsic stacking-fault energy of copper strongly depends on the temperature as well as on the presences of point defects. The intrinsic stacking-fault energy varies between 20 and 77 mJ/m<sup>2</sup> depending on the presence of point defects in the faulted region. These point defects are also found to affect the unstable stacking-fault energy, but they always increase the twinning tendency of copper. Among them, the substitutional P is found to have the strongest effects, decreasing the intrinsic stacking-fault energy and increasing the twinnability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio method", "Dumbbell likes", "Intrinsic stacking fault", "Lattice sites", "Monovacancies", "Nearest neighbor distance", "Stacking fault energies", "Substitutional impurities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927137336", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"]], "AuthorData": {"55588581000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55588581000", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Division of Materials Technology, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)"}, "7003798130": {"Name": "Korzhavyi P.", "AuthorID": "7003798130", "AffiliationID": "60068687, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Physics, Ural Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}}}
