Whole-genome sequencing identified a unique variant (c.20+544G>T) in this locus, within an intronic regulatory region of GRHL2. Targeted sequencing identified the same variant in three additional previously unsolved PPCD-affected families, including a de novo occurrence that suggests this is a recurrent mutation. Two further unique variants were identified in intron 1 of GRHL2 (c.20+257delT and c.20+133delA) in unrelated PPCD-affected families. GRHL2 is a transcription factor that suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is a direct transcriptional repressor of ZEB1. ZEB1 mutations leading to haploinsufficiency cause PPCD3. We previously identified promoter mutations in OVOL2, a gene not normally expressed in the corneal endothelium, as the cause of PPCD1. OVOL2 drives mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) by directly inhibiting EMT-inducing transcription factors, such as ZEB1. Here, we demonstrate that the GRHL2 regulatory variants identified in PPCD4-affected individuals induce increased transcriptional activity in vitro. Furthermore, although GRHL2 is not expressed in corneal endothelial cells in control tissue, we detected GRHL2 in the corneal \u201cendothelium\u201d in PPCD4 tissue. These cells were also positive for epithelial markers E-Cadherin and Cytokeratin 7, indicating they have transitioned to an epithelial-like cell type. We suggest that mutations inducing MET within the corneal endothelium are a convergent pathogenic mechanism leading to dysfunction of the endothelial barrier and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corneal dystrophy", "corneal edema", "corneal endothelium", "ectopic expression", "epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition", "GRHL2", "mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition", "non-coding mutation", "PPCD", "regulatory region"], "IndexKeywords": ["Base Sequence", "Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary", "DNA, Intergenic", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Family", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Introns", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042610720", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "51763434300": {"Name": "Dudakova L.", "AuthorID": "51763434300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "6507413509": {"Name": "Skalicka P.", "AuthorID": "6507413509", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague, U Nemocnice 2"}, "15066073600": {"Name": "Stranecky V.", "AuthorID": "15066073600", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "6602555812": {"Name": "Kmoch S.", "AuthorID": "6602555812", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "7004322480": {"Name": "Filipec M.", "AuthorID": "7004322480", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague, U Nemocnice 2"}, "56457229300": {"Name": "Evans C.J.", "AuthorID": "56457229300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57191584007": {"Name": "Rojas Lopez K.E.", "AuthorID": "57191584007", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "37665820900": {"Name": "Pontikos N.", "AuthorID": "37665820900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "55360582400": {"Name": "Athanasiou D.", "AuthorID": "55360582400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57190176476": {"Name": "Jama H.", "AuthorID": "57190176476", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602525615": {"Name": "Thaung C.", "AuthorID": "6602525615", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57204676942": {"Name": "Cheetham M.E.", "AuthorID": "57204676942", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "35315591900": {"Name": "Davidson A.E.", "AuthorID": "35315591900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7004170546": {"Name": "Sach J.", "AuthorID": "7004170546", "AffiliationID": "60011227, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pathology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady"}, "7004454391": {"Name": "Tuft S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004454391", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
