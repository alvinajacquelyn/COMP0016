Through the case of the history of Separation Logic, we explore how this assertion is more than idle poetry. Separation Logic works because it merges the software engineer\u2019s conceptual model of a program\u2019s manipulation of computer memory with the logical model that interprets what sentences in the logic are true, and because it has a proof theory which aids in the crucial problem of scaling the reasoning task. Scalability is a central problem, and some would even say the central problem, in appli- cations of logic in computer science. Separation Logic is an interesting case because of its widespread success in verification tools. For these two senses of model\u2014the engineering/conceptual and the logical\u2014to merge in a genuine sense, each must maintain their norms of use from their home disciplines. When this occurs, both the logic and engineering benefit greatly. Seeking this intersection of two different senses of model provides a strategy for how computer scientists and logicians may be successful. Furthermore, the history of Separation Logic for analysing programs provides a novel case for philosophers of science of how software engineers and computer scientists develop models and the components of such models. We provide three contributions: an exploration of the extent of models merging that is necessary for success in computer science; an introduction to the technical details of Separation Logic, which can be used for reasoning about other exhaustible resources; and an introduction to (a subset of) the problems, process, and results of computer scientists for those outside the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Logical modelling", "Modelling strategies", "Philosophy of engineering", "Programming and verification", "Separation Logic", "Software engineering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055880158", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "56165471900": {"Name": "Spring J.M.", "AuthorID": "56165471900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "24303037300": {"Name": "O\u2019Hearn P.", "AuthorID": "24303037300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}}}
