This change in molecular state represents the basis of several conformational diseases with pathological gain-of-function and loss-of-function phenotypes, termed serpinopathies. Tools that enable quantification and characterization of polymer formation are therefore important to the study of serpin behavior in this pathophysiological context. Such methods rely on different manifestations of molecular change: polymerization\u2014the generation of molecules with increasing molecular weight\u2014is accompanied by concomitant structural rearrangements in the constituent subunits. Different approaches may be appropriate dependent on whether measurements are made on static samples, such as tissue or cell culture extracts, or in time-resolved experiments, often undertaken using polymers artificially induced under in vitro destabilizing conditions. In the former category, we describe the application of polyacrylamide electrophoresis, Western blot, ELISA, and negative-stain electron microscopy and in the latter category, F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence spectroscopy using environment-sensitive probes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ELISA", "FRET", "Monoclonal antibody", "Negative-stain electron microscopy", "Oligomerization", "Polymerization", "Protein aggregation", "Western blot"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "Humans", "Microscopy, Electron", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Protein Multimerization", "Serpins"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053077712", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56899333600": {"Name": "Elliston E.", "AuthorID": "56899333600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory and the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory and the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "26643229900": {"Name": "Irving J.", "AuthorID": "26643229900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory and the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
