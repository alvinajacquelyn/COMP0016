A near-field enhancement of the scattered field amplitude is observed for small tip-sample separations, allowing image resolutions of \u223c1 \u03bcm (\u223c\u03bb/100) and \u223c7 \u03bcm to be achieved along orthogonal directions on the sample surface. This represents the highest resolution demonstrated to date with a THz QCL. By employing a detection scheme based on self-mixing interferometry, our approach offers experimental simplicity by removing the need for an external detector and also provides sensitivity to the phase of the reinjected field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Detection scheme", "Highest resolutions", "Near-field enhancement", "Orthogonal directions", "Scattered field", "Self mixing interferometry", "Self-mixing effects", "Terahertz imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960079220", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"7201481463": {"Name": "Dean P.", "AuthorID": "7201481463", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55955769400": {"Name": "Keeley J.", "AuthorID": "55955769400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55582394600": {"Name": "Kundu I.", "AuthorID": "55582394600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "8605376300": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "8605376300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7005415578": {"Name": "Linfield E.", "AuthorID": "7005415578", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "56911604400": {"Name": "Giles Davies A.", "AuthorID": "56911604400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
