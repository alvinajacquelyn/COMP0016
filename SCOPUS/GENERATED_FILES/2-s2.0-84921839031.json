When this level of detail is combined with computing power and fast and reliable analysis software, high-content screenings using SR becomes a practical option to address multiple biological questions. The importance of combining these powerful analytical techniques cannot be ignored, as they can address phenotypic changes on the molecular scale and in a statistically robust manner. In this work, we suggest an easy-to-implement protocol that can be applied to set up a high-content 3D SR experiment with user-friendly and freely available software. The protocol can be divided into two main parts: chamber and sample preparation, where a protocol to set up a direct STORM (dSTORM) sample is presented; and a second part where a protocol for image acquisition and analysis is described. We intend to take the reader step-by-step through the experimental process highlighting possible experimental bottlenecks and possible improvements based on recent developments in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D", "DSTORM", "High-content screening", "Immunofluorescence", "Localization microscopy", "Multicolor", "Super-resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Color", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mice", "Microscopy"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921839031", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"22235487300": {"Name": "Pereira P.", "AuthorID": "22235487300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55754360400": {"Name": "Almada P.", "AuthorID": "55754360400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "30067763700": {"Name": "Henriques R.", "AuthorID": "30067763700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
