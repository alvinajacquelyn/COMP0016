Asymmetric-dimethylarginine (ADMA), an eNOS inhibitor, is elevated in cirrhosis and correlates with the severity of portal hypertension. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) is the key enzyme metabolizing hepatic ADMA. This study characterized DDAH-1 in cirrhosis, and explored hepatic DDAH-1 reconstitution through farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonism and DDAH-1 gene therapy. Methods: DDAH-1 immunohistochemistry was conducted on human cirrhosis and healthy liver tissue. Subsequently, shamoperated or bile-duct-ligated (BDL) cirrhosis rats were treated with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OA, 5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 days. Further, animals underwent hydrodynamic injection with DDAH-1-expressing plasmid or saline control, which resulted in the following groups: sham + saline, BDL + saline, BDL + DDAH-1-plasmid. Portal pressure (PP) measurements were performed. Plasma ALT was measured by COBAS INTEGRA, DDAH-1 expression by qPCR and Western blot, eNOS activity by radiometric assay. Results: Immunohistochemistry and Western-blotting confirmed hepatic DDAH-1 was restricted to hepatocytes, and expression decreased significantly in cirrhosis. In BDL rats, reduced DDAH- 1 expression was associated with elevated hepatic ADMA, reduced eNOS activity and high PP. OA treatment significantly increased DDAH-1 expression, reduced hepatic tissue ADMA, and increased liver NO generation. PP was significantly reduced in BDL + OA vs. BDL + vehicle (8 \u00b1 1 vs. 13.5 \u00b1 0.6 mmHg; p <0.01) with no change in the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Similarly, DDAH-1 hydrodynamic injection significantly increased hepatic DDAH-1 gene and protein expression, and significantly reduced PP in BDL + DDAH-1 vs. BDL + saline (p <0.01). Conclusions: This study demonstrates DDAH-1 is a specific molecular target for portal pressure reduction, through actions on ADMA-mediated regulation of eNOS activity.
