In September 2016, the expert panel met for the third time. The topics discussed highlighted important issues covering the impacts of expanded carrier screening, direct-to-consumer genetic testing, voiding of the presumed anonymity of gamete donors by advanced genetic testing, advances in the research of genetic causes underlying male and female infertility, utilisation of massively parallel sequencing in preimplantation genetic testing and non-invasive prenatal screening, mitochondrial replacement in human oocytes, and additionally, issues related to cross-generational epigenetic inheritance following IVF and germline genome editing. The resulting paper represents a consensus of both professional societies involved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assisted reproductive technology", "Epigenetics", "Expanded carrier screening", "Female infertility", "Gamete donor anonymity", "Germline genome editing", "Male infertility", "Mitochondrial replacement therapy", "Non-invasive prenatal testing", "Preimplantation genetic testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Congresses as Topic", "Genetic Testing", "Genetics, Medical", "Humans", "Reproductive Techniques, Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036534648", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7402361999": {"Name": "Harper J.C.", "AuthorID": "7402361999", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "35332282600": {"Name": "Macek M.", "AuthorID": "35332282600", "AffiliationID": "60023469, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Charles University - 2nd Faculty of Medicine and Motol University Hospital"}, "7004087733": {"Name": "Aittom\u00e4ki K.", "AuthorID": "7004087733", "AffiliationID": "60016987", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Genetics, Helsinki University Hospital"}, "8675114300": {"Name": "Borry P.", "AuthorID": "8675114300", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Centre for Biomedical Ethics and Law, KU Leuven"}, "7006738831": {"Name": "Cornel M.C.", "AuthorID": "7006738831", "AffiliationID": "60117142, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Section Community Genetics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004309995": {"Name": "De Wert G.", "AuthorID": "7004309995", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Ethics and Society, Research Schools CAPHRI and GROW, Maastricht University"}, "6506361500": {"Name": "Dondorp W.", "AuthorID": "6506361500", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Ethics and Society, Research Schools CAPHRI and GROW, Maastricht University"}, "7006576043": {"Name": "Geraedts J.", "AuthorID": "7006576043", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Department Genetics and Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "56248843300": {"Name": "Gianaroli L.", "AuthorID": "56248843300", "AffiliationID": "112599869", "AffiliationName": "S.I.S.Me.R.
