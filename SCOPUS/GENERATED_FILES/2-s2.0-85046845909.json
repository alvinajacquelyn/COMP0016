The modelling of conventional forecast methods requires enormous monitoring data that limit its application. To conduct accurate displacement prediction with limited data, a novel method is proposed and applied by integrating three computational intelligence algorithms namely: the wavelet transform (WT), the artificial bees colony (ABC), and the kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM). At first, the total displacement was decomposed into several sub-sequences with different frequencies using the WT. Next each sub-sequence was predicted separately by the KELM whose parameters were optimized by the ABC. Finally the predicted total displacement was obtained by adding all the predicted sub-sequences. The Shuping landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study. The performance of the new method was compared with the WT-ELM, ABC-KELM, ELM, and the support vector machine (SVM) methods. Results show that the prediction accuracy can be improved by decomposing the total displacement into sub-sequences with various frequencies and by predicting them separately. The ABC-KELM algorithm shows the highest prediction capacity followed by the ELM and SVM. Overall, the proposed method achieved excellent performance both in terms of accuracy and stability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046845909", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55976019600": {"Name": "Zhou C.", "AuthorID": "55976019600", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Faculty, China University of Geosciences"}, "8905848100": {"Name": "Yin K.", "AuthorID": "8905848100", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Faculty, China University of Geosciences"}, "55976717100": {"Name": "Cao Y.", "AuthorID": "55976717100", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Faculty, China University of Geosciences"}, "55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London (UCL)"}, "56995453200": {"Name": "Fu X.", "AuthorID": "56995453200", "AffiliationID": "120671986", "AffiliationName": "Administration of Prevention and Control of GeoHazards in the Three Gorges Reservoir of China"}}}
