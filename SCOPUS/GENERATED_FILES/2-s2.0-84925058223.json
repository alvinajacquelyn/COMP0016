Four different levels of processing were considered: (A) recognition of the object concepts; (B) search for semantic associations related to object stimuli; (C) retrieval of semantic concepts of interest; and (D) retrieval of stimulus specific concepts as required for naming. During semantic association matching on picture stimuli or heard object names, we found that activation in both subregions was higher when the objects were semantically related (mug-kettle) than unrelated (car-teapot). This is consistent with both LATL subregions playing a role in (C), the successful retrieval of amodal semantic concepts. In addition, one subregion was more activated for object naming than matching semantically related objects, consistent with (D), the retrieval of a specific concept for naming. We discuss the implications of these novel findings for cognitive models of semantic processing and left anterior temporal lobe function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior temporal lobe", "FMRI", "Naming", "Semantic memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Concept Formation", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Semantics", "Temporal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925058223", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"15021270400": {"Name": "Sanju\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "15021270400", "AffiliationID": "60002676", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology and Functional Imaging Group, Departamento de Psicolog\u00eda B\u00e1sica, Cl\u00ednica y Psicobiolog\u00eda, Universitat Jaume I"}, "55650055400": {"Name": "Hope T.", "AuthorID": "55650055400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "56500677100": {"Name": "Parker Jones '.", "AuthorID": "56500677100", "AffiliationID": "60009456, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson College, University of Oxford"}, "37057820200": {"Name": "Prejawa S.", "AuthorID": "37057820200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "55941059900": {"Name": "Oberhuber M.", "AuthorID": "55941059900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "56900645900": {"Name": "Guerin J.", "AuthorID": "56900645900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "6602537740": {"Name": "Seghier M.", "AuthorID": "6602537740", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "35448982000": {"Name": "Price C.", "AuthorID": "35448982000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "57193517158": {"Name": "Green D.", "AuthorID": "57193517158", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
