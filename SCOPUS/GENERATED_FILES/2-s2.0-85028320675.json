However, the functional relationship between human leukocyte antigen gene(s) and disease development remains unknown. To elucidate major histocompatibility complex-linked systemic sclerosis genetics, we performed genotyping of major histocompatibility complex-borne microsatellites and HLA-DPB1 alleles using DNA obtained from 318 anti-topoisomerase I antibody-positive patients and 561 healthy controls, all of Japanese descent. Those results revealed two major histocompatibility complex haplotypes associated with systemic sclerosis. Exome sequencing and targeted analysis of these risk haplotypes identified rs17847931 in RXRB as a susceptibility variant (P = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221215; odds ratio [OR] = 9.4) with amino acid substitution p.V95A on the risk haplotype harboring HLA-DPB1\u221713:01. No identical variant in the other haplotype including DPB1*09:01 was observed, though that haplotype also showed a significant association (P = 8.5 \u00d7 10\u221222; OR = 4.3) with systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, the number of risk factors was shown to be a predominant factor, as individuals with two factors had elevated risk (P = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u221213; OR = 30.2). We concluded that RXRB may be involved in antifibrotic activity in skin and chromatin remodeling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Antinuclear", "Case-Control
