While this may offer valuable insight into the end of the reionization process, it presents a challenge to the detailed spectroscopic study of bright photometrically-selected distant sources now being found via deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and particularly those highly magnified sources viewed through foreground lensing clusters. In this paper,we demonstrate the validity of a newway forward via the detection of an alternative diagnostic line, CIII] \u03bb1909 \u00c5, seen in spectroscopic exposures of a star-forming galaxy at z<inf>Ly\u03b1</inf> = 6.029. We also report tentative detection of CIII] \u03bb1909 \u00c5 in a galaxy at z<inf>Ly\u03b1</inf> = 7.213. The former 3.3\u03c3 detection is based on a 3.5 h XShooter spectrum of a bright (J<inf>125</inf> = 25.2) gravitationally-lensed galaxy behind the cluster Abell 383. The latter 2.8\u03c3 detection is based on a 4.2 h MOSFIRE spectra of one of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, GN-108036, with J<inf>140</inf> = 25.2. Both targets were chosen for their continuum brightness and previously-known redshift (based on Ly \u03b1), ensuring that any C III] emission would be located in a favourable portion of the near-infrared sky spectrum. Since the availability of secure Ly \u03b1 redshifts significantly narrows the wavelength range where CIII] is sought, this increases confidence in these, otherwise, low-signal-to-noise ratio detections. We compare our CIII] and Ly \u03b1 equivalent widths in the context of those found at z \u2243 2 from earlier work and discuss the motivation for using lines other than Ly \u03b1 to study galaxies in the reionization era.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: observations", "Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: formation", "Galaxies: high-redshift"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929638221", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"12242554300": {"Name": "Stark D.", "AuthorID": "12242554300", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "55731742600": {"Name": "Cl\u00e9ment B.", "AuthorID": "55731742600", "AffiliationID": "60023578", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1"}, "9437218600": {"Name": "Robertson B.", "AuthorID": "9437218600", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "14627922300": {"Name": "Richard J.", "AuthorID": "14627922300", "AffiliationID": "60023578", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1"}, "57203258248": {"Name": "Charlot S.", "AuthorID": "57203258248", "AffiliationID": "60015201, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "UPMC-CNRS, UMR7095, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris"}, "55947750400": {"Name": "Gutkin J.", "AuthorID": "55947750400", "AffiliationID": "60015201, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "UPMC-CNRS, UMR7095, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris"}, "26530507100": {"Name": "Wofford A.", "AuthorID": "26530507100", "AffiliationID": "60015201, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "UPMC-CNRS, UMR7095, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "36483517800": {"Name": "Schenker M.", "AuthorID": "36483517800", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "35227996700": {"Name": "Siana B.", "AuthorID": "35227996700", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside"}}}
