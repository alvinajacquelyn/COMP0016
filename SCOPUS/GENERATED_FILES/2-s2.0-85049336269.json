Methods: Eighty participants with SMA types 2 and 3, enrolled in an international multicenter natural history study, were evaluated with lower extremity range of motion testing and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded. Results: A hip extension joint angle of -7.5\u00b0 or less for SMA type 2 and 0\u00b0 or less for SMA type 3 identified diminished motor ability with good sensitivity. For knee extension, a joint angle of -9.0\u00b0 or less for SMA type 2 or 0\u00b0 or less for SMA type 3 was similarly sensitive. Conclusions: Minimal hip and knee joint contractures were associated with diminished motor ability. Clinical trial designs should consider the effect of contractures on motor function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contractures", "motor function", "outcome measures", "range of motion", "spinal muscular
