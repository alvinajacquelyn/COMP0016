This requires identifying which correlates are the most important predictors of loneliness. This study demonstrates the use of recursive partitioning in exploring the characteristics and assessing the relative importance of correlates of loneliness in older adults. Method: Using exploratory regression trees and random forests, we examined combinations and the relative importance of 42 correlates in relation to loneliness at age 68 among 2453 participants from the birth cohort study the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Results: Positive mental well-being, personal mastery, identifying the spouse as the closest confidant, being extrovert and informal social contact were the most important correlates of lower loneliness levels. Participation in organised groups and demographic correlates were poor identifiers of loneliness. The regression tree suggested that loneliness was not raised among those with poor mental wellbeing if they identified their partner as closest confidante and had frequent social contact. Conclusion: Recursive partitioning can identify which combinations of experiences and circumstances characterise high-risk groups. Poor mental wellbeing and sparse social contact emerged as especially important and classical demographic factors as insufficient in identifying high loneliness levels among older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Loneliness", "psycho-social interventions", "random forest", "recursive partitioning", "regression trees"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Fatigue", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Loneliness", "Male", "Mental Fatigue", "Personal Satisfaction", "Personality", "Social Networking", "Social Participation", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042334496", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56386123700": {"Name": "Ejlskov L.", "AuthorID": "56386123700", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Science and Technology, Aalborg University"}, "15046608700": {"Name": "B\u00f8ggild H.", "AuthorID": "15046608700", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Science and Technology, Aalborg University"}, "57193745204": {"Name": "Wulff J.", "AuthorID": "57193745204", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "7005374676": {"Name": "Stafford M.", "AuthorID": "7005374676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}}}
