Treatment of [Mo(CO)3(NCMe)3] with pyrimidine-2-thiol (pymSH) and PPh3 at 60 \u00b0C in MeCN afforded the known mononuclear compounds cis-[Mo(CO)4(PPh3)2] (1) and [Mo(\u043a2-pymS)4] (2), and the new binuclear compound [Mo2(CO)4(\u03bc,\u043a2-pymS)2(PPh3)2] (3), which possesses idealized C2 symmetry. A different product distribution was found when dppm was employed as the phosphine ligand. Of the five reaction products isolated, three consisted of mononuclear compounds, [Mo(CO)4(\u043a2-dppm)] (4), [Mo(CO)3(\u03ba2-dppm)(\u03ba1-dppm)] (5) and [Mo(CO)(\u043a2-pymS)2(\u043a2-dppm)] (6), with the remaining two products corresponding to dinuclear compounds, [Mo2(CO)6(\u03bc,\u043a1-pymS)2(\u03bc,\u043a2-dppm)] (7) and [Mo2(CO)4(\u03bc,\u043a2-pymS)2(\u043a2-dppm)] (8). Products 6\u20138 are new and have been fully characterized in solution by IR and NMR spectroscopy, and by X-ray crystallography in the case of 6 and 7. The reaction of [Mo(CO)3(NCMe)3] with PhSH and dppm at 60 \u00b0C in MeCN was also examined to assess the effect of thiol on the product distribution. The two principal products isolated were identified as the mononuclear compound [Mo(CO)2(\u03ba1-PhS)2(\u03ba2-dppm)] (9) and the dinuclear compound [Mo2(CO)6(\u03bc,\u03ba1-PhS)2(\u03bc,\u03ba2-dppm)] (10). The bonding in compounds 3, 6 and 7 was also examined by DFT, and highlights between the computational and experimental structures are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DFT", "Mono- and di-molybdenum complexes", "Phosphine mediators", "Thiol activation", "X-ray structures"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062444987", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57217881127": {"Name": "Roknuzzaman", "AuthorID": "57217881127", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "8895853700": {"Name": "Abedin S.M.T.", "AuthorID": "8895853700", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "56186166500": {"Name": "Haque M.R.", "AuthorID": "56186166500", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.E.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7103239169": {"Name": "Richmond M.G.", "AuthorID": "7103239169", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
