The Journal of Physiology \u00a9 2016 The Physiological SocietyAdult tissues maintain function and architecture through robust homeostatic mechanisms mediated by self-renewing cells capable of generating all resident cell types. However, severe injury can challenge the regeneration potential of such a stem/progenitor compartment. Indeed, upon injury adult tissues can exhibit massive cellular plasticity in order to achieve proper tissue regeneration, circumventing an impaired stem/progenitor compartment. Several examples of such plasticity have been reported in both rapidly and slowly self-renewing organs and follow conserved mechanisms. Upon loss of the cellular compartment responsible for maintaining homeostasis, quiescent or slowly proliferating stem/progenitor cells can acquire high proliferation potential and turn into active stem cells, or, alternatively, mature cells can de-differentiate into stem-like cells or re-enter the cell cycle to compensate for the tissue loss. This extensive cellular plasticity acts as a key mechanism to respond to multiple stimuli in a context-dependent manner, enabling tissue regeneration in a robust fashion. In this review cellular plasticity in the adult liver and stomach will be examined, highlighting the diverse cell populations capable of repairing the damaged tissue.
