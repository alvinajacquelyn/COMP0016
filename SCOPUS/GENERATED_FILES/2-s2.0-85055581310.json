The EMMIE framework was developed to meet this aim. It encapsulates five broad categories of research evidence that are considered relevant to crime reduction, namely Effect size, Mechanism, Moderator (or context), Implementation and Economics. In this paper, we chart the origins and development of EMMIE. We also reflect on our experience of applying EMMIE both as a coding system to appraise systematic review evidence and as a framework to inform the design and conduct of systematic reviews in crime reduction. We conclude with a critique of EMMIE and with suggestions on how it might be developed and refined in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crime reduction", "EMMIE", "evidence-based policing", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055581310", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57193519475": {"Name": "Thornton A.", "AuthorID": "57193519475", "AffiliationID": "60090044", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute, University College London"}, "23028792600": {"Name": "Sidebottom A.", "AuthorID": "23028792600", "AffiliationID": "60090044", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute, University College London"}, "26532370500": {"Name": "Belur J.", "AuthorID": "26532370500", "AffiliationID": "60090044", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute, University College London"}, "37102850600": {"Name": "Tompson L.", "AuthorID": "37102850600", "AffiliationID": "60090044", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute, University College London"}, "7006388124": {"Name": "Bowers K.", "AuthorID": "7006388124", "AffiliationID": "60090044", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute, University College London"}}}
