SYNE1 was originally discovered in 2007 as the causal gene underlying autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 1, a disease clinically thought to manifest with mainly pure cerebellar ataxia. Since the original report SYNE1 mutations have also been identified in families with motor neuronopathy and arthrogryposis but few families have been screened as the gene is very large at 146 exons in length. We screened 196 recessive and sporadic ataxia patients for mutations in SYNE1 using next generation sequencing in order to assess its frequency and extend the clinicogenetic spectrum. We identified four novel truncating mutations spread throughout the SYNE1 gene from three families living in London that originated from England, Turkey and Sri Lanka. The phenotype was mainly pure cerebellar ataxia in two families, cognitive decline was present in all three families, axonal neuropathy in one family and marked spasticity in the Turkish family, with a range of disease severities. Searching for genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in the SYNE1 gene, defects located near the 3\u2032 prime end of the gene are more frequently associated with motor neuron or neuromuscular involvement so far. Our data indicate SYNE1 mutations are not an uncommon cause of recessive ataxia with or without additional clinical features in patients from various ethnicities. The use of next generation sequencing allows the rapid analysis of large genes and will likely reveal more SYNE1 associated cases and further expand genotype\u2013phenotype correlations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical severity", "Gene", "Genotype\u2013phenotype", "Mutation", "Spinocerebellar ataxia", "SYNE1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cerebellar Ataxia", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sri Lanka", "Turkey", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968552335", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"12753849900": {"Name": "Wiethoff S.", "AuthorID": "12753849900", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurology and Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, Eberhard-Karls-University"}, "13403335000": {"Name": "Hersheson J.", "AuthorID": "13403335000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8581587200": {"Name": "Bettencourt C.", "AuthorID": "8581587200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.W.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Laboratory, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Laboratory, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
