Primary cardiac involvement may lead to systolic dysfunction, and/or diastolic dysfunction, pericardial disease, conduction abnormalities (including brady- and tachyarrhythmias), and less commonly valvular disease. Autopsy studies and cardiac MRI studies have shown that subclinical cardiac involvement is extremely common.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac involvement", "Coronary disease", "Echocardiography", "Hypertension", "Ischemia", "Valvular"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020730327", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"35393553500": {"Name": "Coghlan J.G.", "AuthorID": "35393553500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}}}
