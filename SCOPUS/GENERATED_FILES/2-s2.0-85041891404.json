To this end, we investigate various ways to trade accuracy for speed and memory usage in modern convolutional object detection systems. A number of successful systems have been proposed in recent years, but apples-toapples comparisons are difficult due to different base feature extractors (e.g., VGG, Residual Networks), different default image resolutions, as well as different hardware and software platforms. We present a unified implementation of the Faster R-CNN [30], R-FCN [6] and SSD [25] systems, which we view as \"meta-architectures\" and trace out the speed/accuracy trade-off curve created by using alternative feature extractors and varying other critical parameters such as image size within each of these meta-architectures. On one extreme end of this spectrum where speed and memory are critical, we present a detector that achieves real time speeds and can be deployed on a mobile device. On the opposite end in which accuracy is critical, we present a detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance measured on the COCO detection task.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Detection tasks", "Feature extractor", "Hardware and software", "Memory usage", "Object detection systems", "Object detectors", "State-of-the-art performance", "Trade-off curves"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041891404", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"50761096800": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "50761096800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57159248400": {"Name": "Rathod V.", "AuthorID": "57159248400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55635707000": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "55635707000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55421073300": {"Name": "Zhu M.", "AuthorID": "55421073300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55208184500": {"Name": "Korattikara A.", "AuthorID": "55208184500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56533445400": {"Name": "Fathi A.", "AuthorID": "56533445400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "54899111300": {"Name": "Fischer I.", "AuthorID": "54899111300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191072718": {"Name": "Wojna Z.", "AuthorID": "57191072718", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57201317669": {"Name": "Song Y.", "AuthorID": "57201317669", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6506759870": {"Name": "Guadarrama S.", "AuthorID": "6506759870", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "34875408300": {"Name": "Murphy K.", "AuthorID": "34875408300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
