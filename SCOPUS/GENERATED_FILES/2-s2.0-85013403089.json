We undertook a critical appraisal of the literature to identify key preoperative prognostic factors of clinical outcomes in patients with SSM who were treated surgically. The results of this study could be used to modify existing or develop new CPRs. Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched (1990-2015), without language restriction, to identify studies that performed multivariate analysis of preoperative predictors of survival, neurological, functional and HRQoL outcomes in surgical patients with SSM. Individual studies were assessed for class of evidence. The strength of the overall body of evidence was evaluated using GRADE for each predictor. Results: Among 4,818 unique citations, 17 were included; all were in English, rated Class III and focused on survival, revealing a total of 46 predictors. The strength of the overall body of evidence was very low for 39 and low for 7 predictors. Due to considerable heterogeneity in patient samples and prognostic factors investigated as well as several methodological issues, our results had a moderately high risk of bias and were difficult to interpret. Conclusions: The quality of evidence for predictors of survival was, at best, low. We failed to identify studies that evaluated preoperative prognostic factors for neurological, functional, or HRQoL outcomes in surgical patients with SSM. We formulated methodological recommendations for prognostic studies to promote acquiring high-quality evidence to better estimate predictor effect sizes to improve patient education, surgical decision-making and development of CPRs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Factual", "Decision Making", "Decision Support Techniques", "Humans", "Prognosis", "Quality of Life", "Spinal Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013403089", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55239971000": {"Name": "Nater A.", "AuthorID": "55239971000", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Division of Neurosurgery, University of Toronto"}, "57013854300": {"Name": "Martin A.R.", "AuthorID": "57013854300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Division of Neurosurgery, University of Toronto"}, "7005942578": {"Name": "Fehlings M.G.", "AuthorID": "7005942578", "AffiliationID": "60002401, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network"}, "35293591300": {"Name": "Sahgal A.", "AuthorID": "35293591300", "AffiliationID": "60009588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
