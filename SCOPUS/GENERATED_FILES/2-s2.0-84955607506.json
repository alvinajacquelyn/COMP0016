This has partly been due to the challenges of providing a continuous quantitative measurement that is valid and reliable, as well as demonstrating that interventions based on NIRS measurements improve clinical outcome. Recent studies investigating cerebral oxygenation targeted treatment, and defining optimal blood pressure based on an assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity, suggest ways in which this technology may yet be clinically useful.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Pressure", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Oxygen Consumption", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955607506", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7004469087": {"Name": "Da Costa C.", "AuthorID": "7004469087", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Rosie Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "57204953001": {"Name": "Austin T.", "AuthorID": "57204953001", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Rosie Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "7004502276": {"Name": "Greisen G.", "AuthorID": "7004502276", "AffiliationID": "60006564, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital"}}}
