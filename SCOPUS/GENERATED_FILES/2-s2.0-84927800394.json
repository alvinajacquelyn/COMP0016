Published by Taylor & Francis.The asymmetric Laplace likelihood naturally arises in the estimation of conditional quantiles of a response variable given covariates. The estimation of its parameters entails unconstrained maximization of a concave and non-differentiable function over the real space. In this note, we describe a maximization algorithm based on the gradient of the log-likelihood that generates a finite sequence of parameter values along which the likelihood increases. The algorithm can be applied to the estimation of mixed-effects quantile regression, Laplace regression with censored data, and other models based on Laplace likelihood. In a simulation study and in a number of real-data applications, the proposed algorithm has shown notable computational speed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asymmetric Laplace distribution", "direct search optimization algorithms", "Laplace regression", "mixed-effects quantile regression", "quantile regression"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927800394", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"12544844900": {"Name": "Bottai M.", "AuthorID": "12544844900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Biostatistics, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "9337778100": {"Name": "Orsini N.", "AuthorID": "9337778100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Biostatistics, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24468131100": {"Name": "Geraci M.", "AuthorID": "24468131100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health"}}}
