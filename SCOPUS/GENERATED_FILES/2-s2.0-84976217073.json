All these tools can be accessed through an intuitive query-based user interface, which does not require knowledge of the R programming language. provenance is free software released under the GPL-2 licence and will be further expanded based on user feedback.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geochemistry", "Heavy minerals", "Petrography", "Provenance", "Statistics", "U-Pb", "Zircon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Grain size dependence", "Heavy mineral composition", "Heavy minerals", "Multi-dimensional scaling", "Programming environment", "Provenance", "Sediment composition", "Sedimentary provenance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976217073", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"]], "AuthorData": {"6507304421": {"Name": "Vermeesch P.", "AuthorID": "6507304421", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162129", "AffiliationName": "London Geochronology Centre, University College London"}, "36348470200": {"Name": "Resentini A.", "AuthorID": "36348470200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio di Petrografia del Sedimentario, Universit\u00e0 Milano-Bicocca"}, "7003625845": {"Name": "Garzanti E.", "AuthorID": "7003625845", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio di Petrografia del Sedimentario, Universit\u00e0 Milano-Bicocca"}}}
