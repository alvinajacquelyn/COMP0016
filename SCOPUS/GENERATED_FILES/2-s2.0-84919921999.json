There have been many examples of health behavior interventions leading to improvements in NCDs and their risk factors, such as hypertension. However, despite their potential benefits, the uptake of existing behavioral interventions has been limited. Among many barriers to implementation of behavioral treatments are concerns about methodological inadequacies. The current manuscript discusses recent advances in frameworks for the development of interventions, the reporting of trials and their protocols, and areas which need further work. The goal of this article is to increase awareness and encourage further debate about how best to promote high-quality behavioral intervention research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral trials", "Clinical trials", "Control groups", "International Behavioural Trials Network", "Methodology", "Outcomes", "Treatment fidelity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919921999", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7005591384": {"Name": "Bacon S.L.", "AuthorID": "7005591384", "AffiliationID": "60033154", "AffiliationName": "Department of Exercise Science, Concordia University"}, "6603865096": {"Name": "Lavoie K.L.", "AuthorID": "6603865096", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}, "6602722041": {"Name": "Ninot G.", "AuthorID": "6602722041", "AffiliationID": "60108488", "AffiliationName": "iCEPS, University of Montpellier"}, "7005961914": {"Name": "Czajkowski S.", "AuthorID": "7005961914", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "7005777277": {"Name": "Freedland K.E.", "AuthorID": "7005777277", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56906660700": {"Name": "Montgomery P.", "AuthorID": "56906660700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, Oxford University"}, "7201874318": {"Name": "Powell L.H.", "AuthorID": "7201874318", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Rush University Medical Center"}, "7005422536": {"Name": "Spring B.", "AuthorID": "7005422536", "AffiliationID": "60013227", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}}}
