Our basic understanding of the structure of cities comes from the Chicago School of urbanism. Beginning in the 1920s and 1930s, Park, Burgess, and their associates at the University of Chicago developed a series of basic models of urban and metropolitan form based initially on \u201cconcentric zones\u201d (Park, Burgess, & McKenzie, 1925). They later advanced two additional models, a \u201csector model\u201d and a \u201cmultiple nuclei\u201d model (Harris & Ullman, 1945; Hoyt, 1939). In their most basic and simplified form, those models portray an urban core occupied by commerce, industry, and the residential locations of the disadvantaged and the working classes surrounded by more affluent middle and upper class suburbs. For more than a century then, the geographic division between city and suburb was also America\u2019s overarching class divide. The upper and middle classes lived in the suburbs; the poor lived in less advantaged cities or in undeveloped rural places. This outward-oriented suburban pattern reached its pinnacle in the 1980s, captured by the so-called \u201cedge city model,\u201d where suburban office parks and malls outside the city center replicated the functions of the old central business district (Garreau, 1992).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050250540", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"55882545700": {"Name": "Florida R.", "AuthorID": "55882545700", "AffiliationID": "60112541, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Martin Prosperity Institute, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto"}, "55824697400": {"Name": "Adler P.", "AuthorID": "55824697400", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)"}}}
