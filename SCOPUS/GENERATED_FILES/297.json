All rights reserved.This chapter introduces a new approach for sequential nonlinear estimation based on a combination of particle filtering and interval analysis for tracking applications. The method is first presented within the interval framework, by introducing a new concept of box particles for the purposes of drastically reducing the number of particles. In this chapter, the box particle filter (Box-PF) is presented in its original ad hoc formulation. The chapter provides an overview of the Bayesian inference methodology. The chapter gives a theoretical derivation of the Box-PF as a sum of uniform probability density functions (pdfs). It demonstrates the advantages of the Box-PF over a dynamic localization example. The contributions and open issues for future works are summarized in the chapter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian filtering", "Box particle filter (Box-PF)", "Interval methods", "Tracking applications", "Uniform probability density functions (pdfs)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian filtering", "Box-Particle Filters", "Interval methods", "Probability density functions (PDFs)", "Tracking application"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975895946", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"55967629700": {"Name": "Gning A.", "AuthorID": "55967629700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6603292839": {"Name": "Mihaylova L.", "AuthorID": "6603292839", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communications, InfoLab21, Lancaster University"}, "6701471825": {"Name": "Abdallah F.", "AuthorID": "6701471825", "AffiliationID": "60017848, 60160765", "AffiliationName": "HEUDIASYC, UMR CNRS 6599, Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Compi'egne"}, "7006688885": {"Name": "Ristic B.", "AuthorID": "7006688885", "AffiliationID": "60003480", "AffiliationName": "Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Division, Defence Science and Technology Organization"}}}
