Thus, in addition to the usual multiplicative conjunction (with its adjoint implication and unit), our logics also feature a multiplicative disjunction (with its adjoint co-implication and unit). The multiplicatives behave \"sub-classically\", in that disjunction and conjunction are related by a weak distribution principle, rather than by De Morgan equivalence. We formulate a Kripke semantics, covering all our sub-classical bunched logics, in which the multiplicatives are naturally read in terms of resource operations. Our main theoretical result is that validity according to this semantics coincides with provability in a corresponding Hilbertstyle proof system. Our logical investigation sheds considerable new light on how one can understand the multiplicative disjunction, better known as linear logic's \"par\", in terms of resource operations. In particular, and in contrast to the earlier Classical BI, the models of our logics include the heaplike memory models of separation logic, in which disjunction can be interpreted as a property of intersection operations over heaps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bunched logic", "Kripke semantics", "Linear logic", "Modal logic", "Model theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bunched logic", "Kripke semantics", "Linear logic", "Modal logic", "Model theory"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959285254", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"6603688854": {"Name": "Brotherston J.", "AuthorID": "6603688854", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "25522495500": {"Name": "Villard J.", "AuthorID": "25522495500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}}}
