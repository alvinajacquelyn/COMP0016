They carry a significant mortality and morbidity and while their exact pathogenesis remains unclear, the possibility remains that hidden infection may play a role. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether changes in the respiratory microbiota occur during an AE-IPF. Bacterial DNA was extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with stable IPF and those experiencing an AE-IPF. A hyper-variable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) was amplified, quantified and pyrosequenced. Culture independent techniques demonstrate AE-IPF is associated with an increased BAL bacterial burden compared to stable disease and highlight shifts in the composition of the respiratory microbiota during an AE-IPF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["16S", "Acute exacerbation", "Bacterial infection", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Aged", "Bacteria", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Female", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Lung", "Male", "Microbiota", "Recurrence", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011052288", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"43661539300": {"Name": "Molyneaux P.L.", "AuthorID": "43661539300", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "55597087384": {"Name": "Cox M.J.", "AuthorID": "55597087384", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, National Heart and Lung Institute"}, "57206548449": {"Name": "Cookson W.O.C.", "AuthorID": "57206548449", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, National Heart and Lung Institute"}, "7004860467": {"Name": "Moffatt M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004860467", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, National Heart and Lung Institute"}, "56799189700": {"Name": "Maher T.M.", "AuthorID": "56799189700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Fibrosis Research Group, Inflammation, Repair and Development Section, NHLI Imperial College"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7410138275": {"Name": "Kim H.C.", "AuthorID": "7410138275", "AffiliationID": "60032624, 60068691", "AffiliationName": "University of Ulsan, Asan Medical Center"}, "55256983400": {"Name": "Ji W.", "AuthorID": "55256983400", "AffiliationID": "60032624, 60068691", "AffiliationName": "University of Ulsan, Asan Medical Center"}, "26029406300": {"Name": "Kim D.S.", "AuthorID": "26029406300", "AffiliationID": "60032624, 60068691", "AffiliationName": "University of Ulsan, Asan Medical Center"}}}
