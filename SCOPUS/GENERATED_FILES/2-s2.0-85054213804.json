Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.The second data release from ESA's Gaia mission has revealed many ridge-like structures in the velocity distribution of the Milky Way. We show that these can arise naturally from winding transient spiral structure that is commonly seen in N-body simulations of disc galaxies. We construct test particle models of the winding spiral structure, and compare the resulting distribution of orbits with the observed two-dimensional velocity distribution in the extended solar neighbourhood and with the distribution of rotational velocities over 8 kpc along the Sun-Galactic-centre-Galactic anticentre line. We show that the ridges in these observations are well reproduced by the winding spiral model. Additionally, we demonstrate that the transient winding spiral potential can create a Hercules-like feature in the kinematics of the solar neighbourhood, either alone, or in combination with a long-slow bar potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: bulge", "Galaxy: disc", "Galaxy: fundamental parameters", "Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxy: structure", "Solar neighbourhood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054213804", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55668131500": {"Name": "Hunt J.A.S.", "AuthorID": "55668131500", "AffiliationID": "60193810, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto"}, "25640885400": {"Name": "Bovy J.", "AuthorID": "25640885400", "AffiliationID": "121414047", "AffiliationName": "Alfred P.
