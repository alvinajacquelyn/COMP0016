For large biopharmaceutical companies, planning typically involves multiple products and several production facilities. Production is usually done in batches with a substantial set-up cost and time for switching between products. The goal is to satisfy demand while minimising manufacturing, set-up and inventory costs. The resulting production planning problem is thus a variant of the capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem, and a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. Inspired by genetic algorithm approaches to job shop scheduling, this paper proposes a tailored construction heuristic that schedules demands of multiple products sequentially across several facilities to build a multi-year production plan (solution). The sequence in which the construction heuristic schedules the different demands is optimised by a genetic algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a biopharmaceutical lot sizing problem and compare it with a mathematical programming model from the literature. We show that the genetic algorithm can outperform the mathematical programming model for certain scenarios because the discretisation of time in mathematical programming artificially restricts the solution space.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopharmaceutical manufacture", "Capacity planning", "Construction heuristic", "Evolutionary algorithm", "Heuristics", "Scheduling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopharmaceutical manufacture", "Capacitated lot sizing", "Capacity planning", "Genetic algorithm approach", "Heuristics", "Long-term production planning", "Lot-sizing and scheduling", "Mathematical programming models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019662795", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57194336217": {"Name": "Oyebolu F.", "AuthorID": "57194336217", "AffiliationID": "60115484, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Business School, University of Warwick"}, "12242356900": {"Name": "Branke J.", "AuthorID": "12242356900", "AffiliationID": "60115484, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Business School, University of Warwick"}, "57194327177": {"Name": "van Lidth de Jeude J.", "AuthorID": "57194327177", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complexity Science, University of Warwick"}, "55263503500": {"Name": "Siganporia C.", "AuthorID": "55263503500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005343335": {"Name": "Farid S.", "AuthorID": "7005343335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "36615062500": {"Name": "Allmendinger R.", "AuthorID": "36615062500", "AffiliationID": "60026051, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester"}}}
