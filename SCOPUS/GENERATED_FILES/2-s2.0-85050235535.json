All rights reserved.Objective: Self-management of hypertension can reduce and control blood pressure (BP) compared with clinic monitoring. However, self-management relies on patients following an algorithm, which may be variably adhered to. This study reports fidelity of high-risk patients to the self-management algorithm set by the TASMIN-SR trial. Methods: Patients with hypertension, above target clinic BP and one or more of stroke, diabetes, coronary heart disease or chronic kidney disease, were invited to self-monitor following an individualized self-titration algorithm. Home BP readings and medication change details were submitted monthly for 12 months. Readings downloaded from patients' electronic monitors were compared with written submissions, and protocol fidelity was assessed. Results: Two hundred and seventy-six patients were randomized to self-management and 225 (82%) completed the required training sessions. Of these, 166 (74%) completed self-management. A total of 11385 (89.6%) submitted readings were accurate compared with corresponding downloaded monitor readings. Mean error rate was 5.2% per patient, which increased with age but not comorbidities. Patients made 475 of 683 (69.5%) algorithm-recommended medication changes, equating to nearly three medication changes per patient. Mean SBP for patients who completed training and made all recommended changes dropped from 141 mmHg (95% CI 138.26-144.46) to 121 mmHg (95% CI 118.30-124.17 mmHg) compared with 129 mmHg (95% CI 125.27-136.73 mmHg) for patients who made none. Conclusion: Most patients randomized to self-management completed training; however, 36% of these had dropped out by 12 months. Self-monitoring was largely undertaken properly and accurately recorded. Fidelity with self-management was associated with lower achieved SBP. Successful implementation of self-management into daily practice requires careful training and should be accompanied by monitoring of fidelity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "fidelity to intervention", "persistence", "self-management of blood pressure", "training and education"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Coronary Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Self Care", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050235535", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55522751400": {"Name": "Schwartz C.L.", "AuthorID": "55522751400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60175817", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, NIHR School for Primary Care Research, University of Oxford, Radclife Observatory Quarter"}, "57193599382": {"Name": "Richard Hobbs F.D.", "AuthorID": "57193599382", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60175817", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, NIHR School for Primary Care Research, University of Oxford, Radclife Observatory Quarter"}, "55815978400": {"Name": "McManus R.J.", "AuthorID": "55815978400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60175817", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, NIHR School for Primary Care Research, University of Oxford, Radclife Observatory Quarter"}, "57203002021": {"Name": "Seyed-Safi A.", "AuthorID": "57203002021", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "10541042900": {"Name": "Haque S.", "AuthorID": "10541042900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Science, University of Birmingham"}, "26022822900": {"Name": "Bray E.P.", "AuthorID": "26022822900", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Stroke Research Unit, University of Central Lancashire"}, "57213131359": {"Name": "Greenfield S.", "AuthorID": "57213131359", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7201984993": {"Name": "Little P.", "AuthorID": "7201984993", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57213087308": {"Name": "Mant J.", "AuthorID": "57213087308", "AffiliationID": "60027140, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Wort's Causeway"}, "57198065489": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "57198065489", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, NIHR UCL Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London"}}}
