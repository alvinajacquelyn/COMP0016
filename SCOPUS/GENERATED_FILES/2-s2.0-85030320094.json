Plasma non-transferrin-bound iron and its redox-active component, labile plasma iron, are key sources of iron loading in cardiosiderosis. Risk factors were identified in 73 patients with or without cardiosiderosis. Soluble transferrin receptor-1 levels were significantly lower in patients with cardiosiderosis (odds ratio 21). This risk increased when transfusion-iron loading rates exceeded the erythroid transferrin uptake rate (derived from soluble transferrin receptor-1) by >0.21 mg/kg/day (odds ratio 48). Labile plasma iron was >3-fold higher when this uptake rate threshold was exceeded, but non-transferrin-bound iron and transferrin saturation were comparable. The risk of cardiosiderosis was decreased in patients with low liver iron, ferritin and labile plasma iron, or high bilirubin, reticulocyte counts or hepcidin. We hypothesized that high erythroid transferrin uptake rate decreases cardiosiderosis through increased erythroid re-generation of apotransferrin. To test this, iron uptake and intracellular reactive oxygen species were examined in HL-1 cardiomyocytes under conditions modeling transferrin effects on non-transferrin-bound iron speciation with ferric citrate. Intracellular iron and reactive oxygen species increased with ferric citrate concentrations especially when iron-to-citrate ratios exceeded 1:100, i.e. conditions favoring kinetically labile monoferric rather than oligomer species. Excess iron-binding equivalents of apotransferrin inhibited iron uptake and decreased both intracellular reactive oxygen species and labile plasma iron under conditions favoring monoferric species. In conclusion, high transferrin iron utilization, relative to the transfusion-iron load rate, decreases the risk of cardiosiderosis. A putative mechanism is the transient re-generation of apotransferrin by an active erythron, rapidly binding labile plasma iron-detectable ferric monocitrate species.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Animals", "Apoproteins", "Biomarkers", "Blood Transfusion", "Cell Line", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Citric Acid", "Cohort Studies", "Erythropoiesis", "Hemosiderosis", "Humans", "Infant", "Iron", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Protein Binding", "Risk Factors", "Thalassemia", "Transferrin", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030320094", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"36192891700": {"Name": "Garbowski M.W.", "AuthorID": "36192891700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "35453535900": {"Name": "Evans P.", "AuthorID": "35453535900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Haematology Department, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35759535600": {"Name": "Vlachodimitropoulou E.", "AuthorID": "35759535600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Haematology Department, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "7102451936": {"Name": "Hider R.", "AuthorID": "7102451936", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}}}
