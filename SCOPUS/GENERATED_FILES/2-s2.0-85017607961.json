Nevertheless, heritability estimates of facial traits have often been surprisingly low or difficult to replicate. Furthermore, the construction of facial phenotypes that correspond to naturally perceived facial features remains largely a mystery. We present here a large-scale heritability study of face geometry that aims to address these issues. High-resolution, three-dimensional facial models have been acquired on a cohort of 952 twins recruited from the TwinsUK registry, and processed through a novel landmarking workflow, GESSA (Geodesic Ensemble Surface Sampling Algorithm). The algorithm places thousands of landmarks throughout the facial surface and automatically establishes point-wise correspondence across faces. These landmarks enabled us to intuitively characterize facial geometry at a fine level of detail through curvature measurements, yielding accurate heritability maps of the human face (www.heritabilitymaps.info).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Cohort Studies", "Face", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Twins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017607961", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26656325900": {"Name": "Tsagkrasoulis D.", "AuthorID": "26656325900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "23019288000": {"Name": "Montana G.", "AuthorID": "23019288000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "57203644841": {"Name": "Hysi P.", "AuthorID": "57203644841", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London"}, "35351391300": {"Name": "Spector T.", "AuthorID": "35351391300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London"}}}
