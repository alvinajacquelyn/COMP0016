In doing so, it claims that those methods allow social research to progress theoretically and empirically if the latter is assessed through the epistemological framework of the research program. The latter represents a series of guidelines to assay the progress of science provided by Imre Lakatos\u2019s philosophy of science. In fact, those two methods can be used according to two methodologies, namely, concept formation and causal inference, which in turn perform specific functions essential for social research to develop theoretically and empirically in line with the guidelines established by the research program. In conclusion, a more nuanced discussion of the link between epistemology, methodology, and methods is needed to fully appreciate what comparative case study research is good for.", "AuthorKeywords": ["case study", "comparative research", "Lakatos", "methodology", "Mill", "philosophy of science", "qualitative research", "research program"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940902343", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"56047074000": {"Name": "Vannoni M.", "AuthorID": "56047074000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
