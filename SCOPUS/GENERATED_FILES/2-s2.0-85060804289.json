The selective catalytic oxidation of NH 3 to N 2 presents a promising solution for the abatement of unused NH 3 -based reductants from diesel exhaust after treatment. Supported Pd nanoparticle catalysts show selectivity to N 2 rather than NO x , which is investigated in this work. The link between Pd nanoparticle structure and surface reactivity was found using operando X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transformed spectroscopy and on-line mass spectrometry. Nitrogen insertion into the metallic Pd nanoparticle structure at low temperatures (<200 \u00b0C) was found to be responsible for high N 2 selectivity, whereas the unfavourable formation of NO is linked to adsorbed nitrates, which form at the surface of bulk PdO nanoparticles at high temperatures (>280 \u00b0C). Our work demonstrates the ability of combined operando spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to characterize a previously unidentified PdN x species, and clarify the selectivity-directing structure of supported Pd catalysts for the selective catalytic oxidation of NH 3 to N 2 .", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diesel exhaust after treatments", "Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transformed spectroscopies", "Online mass spectrometry", "Operando spectroscopy", "Selective catalytic oxidation", "Structural selectivity", "Supported Pd catalysts", "Surface reactivity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060804289", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"57130427100": {"Name": "Dann E.K.", "AuthorID": "57130427100", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "56204136500": {"Name": "Rogers S.M.", "AuthorID": "56204136500", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8306766600": {"Name": "Gibson E.K.", "AuthorID": "8306766600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow"}, "57205615905": {"Name": "Blackmore R.H.", "AuthorID": "57205615905", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "18633292200": {"Name": "Chutia A.", "AuthorID": "18633292200", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln"}, "56243169300": {"Name": "Hardacre C.", "AuthorID": "56243169300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering & Analytical Science, The University of Manchester"}, "57205616361": {"Name": "Tierney G.F.", "AuthorID": "57205616361", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "57210161929": {"Name": "Zeinalipour-Yazdi C.D.", "AuthorID": "57210161929", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, University of Greenwich"}, "10038979900": {"Name": "Goguet A.", "AuthorID": "10038979900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source"}, "54419832100": {"Name": "Collier P.", "AuthorID": "54419832100", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57205617836": {"Name": "Erden T.E.", "AuthorID": "57205617836", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57189492850": {"Name": "Raj A.", "AuthorID": "57189492850", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "55462787600": {"Name": "Taylor S.F.R.", "AuthorID": "55462787600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering & Analytical Science, The University of Manchester"}, "55372640600": {"Name": "Kroner A.", "AuthorID": "55372640600", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source"}, "16047911500": {"Name": "Nachtegaal M.", "AuthorID": "16047911500", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institute"}, "55547130317": {"Name": "Thompson P.", "AuthorID": "55547130317", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "XMaS (the UK CRG Beamline), European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}}}
