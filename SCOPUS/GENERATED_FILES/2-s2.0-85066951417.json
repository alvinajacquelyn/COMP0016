Karger AG, Basel.Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents is the standard care for the treatment of diabetic macular oedema (DME). Anti-VEGF agents have been proven to be effective for DME based on the results of large clinical trials. However, a concern about their safety has been raised, since diabetic patients are a special category, having increased risk for cardiovascular events and other systemic adverse events due to VEGF inhibition. The current evidence from clinical trials has demonstrated that anti-VEGF agents are safe for diabetic patients, with no increased risk of cardiovascular events. In addition, no definite differences in cardiovascular events between the 3 used anti-VEGF agents that is, aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, have been identified.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066951417", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"34969109700": {"Name": "Chatziralli I.P.", "AuthorID": "34969109700", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Ophthalmology, University of Athens"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
