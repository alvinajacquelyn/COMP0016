Patients undergoing TV-ICD explantation may be eligible for reimplantation with an S-ICD; however, information on safety outcomes in this complex population is limited. Objective This analysis was designed to provide outcome and safety data from S-ICD patients who received their device after TV-ICD explantation. Methods Patients in the S-ICD IDE Study and EFFORTLESS Registry with a prior TV-ICD explantation, as well as those with no prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups: those implanted with the S-ICD after TV-ICD extraction for system-related infection (n = 75); those implanted after TV-ICD extraction for reasons other than system-related infection (n = 44); and patients with no prior ICD (de novo implantations, n = 747). Results Mean follow-up duration was 651 days, and all-cause mortality was low (3.2%). Patients previously explanted for TV-ICD infection were older (55.5 \u00b1 14.6, 47.8 \u00b1 14.3 and 49.9 \u00b1 17.3 years in the infection, noninfection, and de novo cohorts, respectively; P =.01), were more likely to have received the ICD for secondary prevention (42.7%, 37.2% and 25.6%; P < 0.0001) and had higher percentages of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, in line with the highest mortality rate (6.7%). Major infection after S-ICD implantation was low in all groups, with no evidence that patients implanted with the S-ICD after TV-ICD explantation for infection were more likely to experience a subsequent reinfection. Conclusion The S-ICD is a suitable alternative for TV-ICD patients whose devices are explanted for any reason. Postimplantation risk of infection remains low even in patients whose devices were explanted for prior TV-ICD infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Death", "Infection", "Safety", "Subcutaneous ICD", "sudden"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electric Countershock", "Equipment Failure", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Implantation", "Reoperation", "Surgical Wound Infection", "Survival Analysis", "Tachycardia, Ventricular", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955468387", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7004921270": {"Name": "Boersma L.", "AuthorID": "7004921270", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, St Antonius Hospital"}, "7402868775": {"Name": "Burke M.C.", "AuthorID": "7402868775", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Heart Rhythm Center, University of Chicago"}, "7004119966": {"Name": "Neuzil P.", "AuthorID": "7004119966", "AffiliationID": "60010760", "AffiliationName": "Homolka Hospital"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57215961404": {"Name": "Friehling T.", "AuthorID": "57215961404", "AffiliationID": "60010459", "AffiliationName": "Inova Fairfax Hospital"}, "6603638449": {"Name": "Theuns D.A.", "AuthorID": "6603638449", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus Medical Center"}, "34770632100": {"Name": "Garcia F.", "AuthorID": "34770632100", "AffiliationID": "60138417", "AffiliationName": "Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania"}, "56163295100": {"Name": "Carter N.", "AuthorID": "56163295100", "AffiliationID": "60031281", "AffiliationName": "Boston Scientific Corporation"}, "57077022700": {"Name": "Stivland T.", "AuthorID": "57077022700", "AffiliationID": "60031281", "AffiliationName": "Boston Scientific Corporation"}, "7404027538": {"Name": "Weiss R.", "AuthorID": "7404027538", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Ohio State University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
