However, other environmental change factors, particularly relating to the natural environment, need to be taken into account to understand the totality of these interactions and impacts. This paper provides an overview of ongoing research in the Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) on Environmental Change and Health, particularly around the positive and negative effects of the natural environment on human health and well-being and primarily within a UK context. In addition to exploring the potential increasing risks to human health from water-borne and vector-borne diseases and from exposure to aeroallergens such as pollen, this paper also demonstrates the potential opportunities and co-benefits to human physical and mental health from interacting with the natural environment. The involvement of a Health and Environment Public Engagement (HEPE) group as a public forum of \"critical friends\" has proven useful for prioritising and exploring some of this research; such public involvement is essential to minimise public health risks and maximise the benefits which are identified from this research into environmental change and human health. Research gaps are identified and recommendations made for future research into the risks, benefits and potential opportunities of climate and other environmental change on human and planetary health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerosolized exposures", "Demographic change", "Infectious diseases", "Land management", "Land-use", "Patient and public involvement (PPI)", "Pollen", "Public health", "Vector-borne diseases", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosolized exposures", "Demographic changes", "Infectious disease", "Land managements", "Pollen", "Public involvement", "Vector-borne disease", "Well being"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049629265", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"7103387986": {"Name": "Fleming L.E.", "AuthorID": "7103387986", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7404176005": {"Name": "White M.P.", "AuthorID": "7404176005", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "55760290600": {"Name": "Alcock I.", "AuthorID": "55760290600", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "56419576500": {"Name": "Maguire K.", "AuthorID": "56419576500", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7103355046": {"Name": "Nichols G.", "AuthorID": "7103355046", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Radiation Chemicals and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}, "7102860699": {"Name": "Wheeler B.W.", "AuthorID": "7102860699", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7401776062": {"Name": "Morris G.", "AuthorID": "7401776062", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7402298809": {"Name": "Taylor T.", "AuthorID": "7402298809", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "36157842500": {"Name": "Bone A.", "AuthorID": "36157842500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Radiation Chemicals and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}, "12772431900": {"Name": "Leonardi G.S.", "AuthorID": "12772431900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57090329000": {"Name": "Macintyre H.L.", "AuthorID": "57090329000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57192887844": {"Name": "Gillingham E.L.", "AuthorID": "57192887844", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology, Emergency Response Department-Science and Technology, Public Health England (PHE)"}, "55976888100": {"Name": "Heaviside C.", "AuthorID": "55976888100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "6603678663": {"Name": "Duarte-Davidson R.", "AuthorID": "6603678663", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Radiation Chemicals and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}, "12789082600": {"Name": "Medlock J.", "AuthorID": "12789082600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology, Emergency Response Department-Science and Technology, Public Health England (PHE)"}, "55249553200": {"Name": "Hansford K.M.", "AuthorID": "55249553200", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology, Emergency Response Department-Science and Technology, Public Health England (PHE)"}, "6701784487": {"Name": "Hemming D.", "AuthorID": "6701784487", "AffiliationID": "60018258", "AffiliationName": "Met Office, Hadley Centre"}, "8872239200": {"Name": "Iacono G.L.", "AuthorID": "8872239200", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Epidemiology and Public Health, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey"}}}
