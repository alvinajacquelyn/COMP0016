X-ray based imaging is a well-established standard for radiotherapy treatments. Over the last few years, the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide radiation-free images with high-resolution and superb soft tissue contrast has highlighted the potential of this imaging modality for radiotherapy treatment planning and motion management. In addition, these advantageous properties motivated several recent developments towards combined MRI radiation therapy treatment units, enabling in-room MRI-guidance and treatment adaptation. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in MRI-based image guidance for organ motion management in external beam radiotherapy. Methodological aspects of MRI for organ motion management are reviewed and their application in treatment planning, in-room guidance and adaptive radiotherapy described. Finally, a roadmap for an optimal use of MRI-guidance is highlighted and future challenges are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["4D MRI", "external beam radiotherapy", "MRI-guidance", "organ motion management", "time-resolved MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["External beam radiotherapy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)", "Methodological aspects", "Organ motion managements", "Radiation therapy treatment", "Radiotherapy treatment", "Radiotherapy treatment planning", "Time-resolved", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Movement", "Neoplasms", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Radiotherapy, Image-Guided"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056725618", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55516696500": {"Name": "Paganelli C.", "AuthorID": "55516696500", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano"}, "7006568878": {"Name": "Baroni G.", "AuthorID": "7006568878", "AffiliationID": "108253503", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Unit, Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica"}, "54953678700": {"Name": "Whelan B.", "AuthorID": "54953678700", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "ACRF Image X Institute, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7006111020": {"Name": "Keall P.", "AuthorID": "7006111020", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "ACRF Image X Institute, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "35189337000": {"Name": "Peroni M.", "AuthorID": "35189337000", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Proton Therapy Center, Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI"}, "57221178852": {"Name": "Lomax T.", "AuthorID": "57221178852", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Proton Therapy Center, Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI"}, "7103106631": {"Name": "Summers P.", "AuthorID": "7103106631", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Divisione di Radiologia, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS"}, "54884371600": {"Name": "Fast M.", "AuthorID": "54884371600", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "56216223400": {"Name": "Van De Lindt T.", "AuthorID": "56216223400", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "8757124700": {"Name": "McClelland J.", "AuthorID": "8757124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "42361164100": {"Name": "Eiben B.", "AuthorID": "42361164100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6507669626": {"Name": "Riboldi M.", "AuthorID": "6507669626", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
