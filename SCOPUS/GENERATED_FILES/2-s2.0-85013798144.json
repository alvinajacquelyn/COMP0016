These lesions have in common the formation of cystic areas and this common feature may suggest involvement of similar mechanisms. The hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), a responsive protein to hypoxia and caspase-3, an irreversible apoptosis marker, may contribute to cyst formation. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the immunoexpression of these proteins in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Material and methods: Twenty cases of ameloblastoma, keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KOT) (n = 20), radicular cyst (RC) (n = 18), dentigerous cyst (DC) (n = 11), calcifying cystic odontogenic tumor (n = 8), and dental follicle (DF) (n = 10) were used to investigate HIF-1\u03b1 and caspase-3 expression in sequential serial cuts by immunohistochemistry. Results: HIF-1\u03b1 was overexpressed in RC, DC, and ameloblastoma when compared with DF. The basal and sometimes the lower suprabasal layer showed no or very low expression in DC, KOT, and ameloblastoma, the last also showing strong expression in solid epithelial areas and initial cystic formation regions. Caspase-3 was found to be overexpressed in all lesions, with the highest expression in odontogenic cysts compared to tumors. HIF-1\u03b1 and caspase-3 were localized in similar areas of the same lesions, especially in the epithelium surrounding cystic formations. Conclusions: This study showed distinct immunoexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 and caspase-3 in odontogenic cyst and tumors, with higher expression observed in odontogenic cysts. Clinical relevance: These findings suggest a possible correlation between hypoxia, apoptosis, and cystogenesis, leading to understand the mechanisms responsible to cystic formation in odontogenic lesions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caspase-3", "Cystogenesis", "HIF-1\u03b1", "Odontogenic cyst", "Odontogenic tumors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ameloblastoma", "Caspase 3", "Dental Sac", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Odontogenic Cysts", "Odontogenic Tumors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013798144", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57214398725": {"Name": "da Costa N.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57214398725", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Cell Culture Laboratory, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Par\u00e1"}, "56305435400": {"Name": "da Silva Kataoka M.S.", "AuthorID": "56305435400", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Cell Culture Laboratory, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Par\u00e1"}, "54388768300": {"Name": "de Alves-J\u00fanior S.M.", "AuthorID": "54388768300", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Cell Culture Laboratory, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Par\u00e1"}, "37064377700": {"Name": "de Jesus Viana Pinheiro J.", "AuthorID": "37064377700", "AffiliationID": "60001890", "AffiliationName": "Cell Culture Laboratory, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Par\u00e1"}, "52463393200": {"Name": "de Siqueira A.S.", "AuthorID": "52463393200", "AffiliationID": "60106091", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry, Universidade Positivo"}, "24178212100": {"Name": "Ribeiro A.L.R.", "AuthorID": "24178212100", "AffiliationID": "60194535", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Center of Para\u2014CESUPA"}, "7201646920": {"Name": "Jaeger R.G.", "AuthorID": "7201646920", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "57209873062": {"Name": "Smith A.M.", "AuthorID": "57209873062", "AffiliationID": "118159784", "AffiliationName": "The Rayne Building, Centre for Molecular Medicine"}}}
