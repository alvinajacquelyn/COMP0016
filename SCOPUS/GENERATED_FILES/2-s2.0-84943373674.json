However, in clinical practice, IHF is assessed indirectly by pre-operative imaging [for example, chemical-shift magnetic resonance (CS-MR)]. We used the opportunity in patients undergoing liver resection to quantify IHF by digital histology (D-IHF) and relate this to CT-derived anthropometrics, insulin-related serum biomarkers, and IHF estimated by CS-MR. Methods A reproducible method for quantification of D-IHF using 7 histology slides (inter- and intra-rater concordance: 0.97 and 0.98) was developed. In 35 patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer metastases, we measured: CT-derived subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue volumes, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting serum adiponectin, leptin and fetuin-A. We estimated relative IHF using CS-MR and developed prediction models for IHF using a factor-clustered approach. Results The multivariate linear regression models showed that D-IHF was best predicted by HOMA-IR (Beta coefficientper doubling: 2.410, 95% CI: 1.093, 5.313) and adiponectin (\u03b2per doubling: 0.197, 95% CI: 0.058, 0.667), but not by anthropometrics. MR-derived IHF correlated with D-IHF (rho: 0.626; p = 0.0001), but levels of agreement deviated in upper range values (CS-MR over-estimated IHF: regression versus zero, p = 0.009); this could be adjusted for by a correction factor (CF: 0.7816). Conclusions Our findings show IHF is associated with measures of insulin resistance, but not measures of visceral adiposity. CS-MR over-estimated IHF in the upper range. Larger studies are indicated to test whether a correction of imaging-derived IHF estimates is valid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hepatic steatosis", "Insulin resistance", "Liver surgery", "Obesity", "Visceral adiposity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Great Britain", "Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Intra-Abdominal Fat", "Liver", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Morbidity", "Obesity", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943373674", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"36239352700": {"Name": "Parkin E.", "AuthorID": "36239352700", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "55776257100": {"Name": "O'Reilly D.A.", "AuthorID": "55776257100", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "56383504700": {"Name": "Coe P.", "AuthorID": "56383504700", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "7003369995": {"Name": "Renehan A.G.", "AuthorID": "7003369995", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, Christie Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005750862": {"Name": "Ammori B.", "AuthorID": "7005750862", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "24072792900": {"Name": "De Liguori Carino N.", "AuthorID": "24072792900", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "12761372300": {"Name": "Deshpande R.", "AuthorID": "12761372300", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "7006628840": {"Name": "Sherlock D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006628840", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, North Manchester General Hospital"}, "14834275900": {"Name": "Plumb A.A.", "AuthorID": "14834275900", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Christie Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35316129900": {"Name": "Manoharan P.", "AuthorID": "35316129900", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Christie Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56669121700": {"Name": "Rao M.", "AuthorID": "56669121700", "AffiliationID": "60031386", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal Oldham Hospital"}, "7007086178": {"Name": "Frystyk J.", "AuthorID": "7007086178", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}}}
