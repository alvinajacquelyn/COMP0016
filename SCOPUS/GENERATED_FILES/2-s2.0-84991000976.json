The research had a particular focus on key stage 3 (11\u201314). For the purposes of this paper, data gained from 18 music staff and 325 student interview transcriptions were reviewed to answer research questions about the music preferences of teachers and students in the context of school music lessons. The data indicated that when teachers chose music they were particularly conscious of difficulty whereas student choices, when permitted, were based solely on liking. Teachers\u2019 choices were often informed by inclusion and feasibility. The music students enjoyed depended on how it was incorporated into the lesson rather than purely on style. Some implications of how music is categorised and chosen are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genre", "music preferences", "Music teaching", "Musical Futures", "musical styles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991000976", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Music", "ARTS", "1210"]], "AuthorData": {"55388536300": {"Name": "McQueen H.", "AuthorID": "55388536300", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7004456112": {"Name": "Hallam S.", "AuthorID": "7004456112", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "26034480800": {"Name": "Creech A.", "AuthorID": "26034480800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
