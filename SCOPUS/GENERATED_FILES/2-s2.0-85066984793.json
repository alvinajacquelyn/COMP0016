In the C. elegans zygote, the timing and geometry of polarization rely on a single dominant cue\u2014the sperm centrosome\u2014that matures at the end of meiosis and specifies the nascent posterior. Polarization requires that the conserved PAR proteins, which specify polarity in the zygote, be poised to respond to the centrosome. Yet, how and when PAR proteins achieve this unpolarized, but responsive, state is unknown. We show that oocyte maturation initiates a fertilization-independent PAR activation program. PAR proteins are initially not competent to polarize but gradually acquire this ability following oocyte maturation. Surprisingly, this program allows symmetry breaking even in unfertilized oocytes lacking centrosomes. Thus, if PAR proteins can respond to multiple polarizing cues, how is specificity for the centrosome achieved? Specificity is enforced by Polo-like and Aurora kinases (PLK-1 and AIR-1 in C. elegans), which impose a delay in the activation of the PAR network so that it coincides with maturation of the centrosome cue. This delay suppresses polarization by non-centrosomal cues, which can otherwise trigger premature polarization and multiple or reversed polarity domains. Taken together, these findings identify a regulatory program that enforces proper polarization by synchronizing PAR network activation with cell cycle progression, thereby ensuring that PAR proteins respond specifically to the correct cue. Temporal control of polarity network activity is likely to be a common strategy to ensure robust, dynamic, and specific polarization in response to developmentally deployed cues. Reich et al. reveal that temporal regulation of PAR protein activation by Aurora and Polo kinases ensures the generation of a single, properly aligned polarity axis in the C. elegans zygote. By restricting sensitivity to non-standard cues, Aurora and Polo ensure timely and specific polarization by the sperm-derived centrosome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aurora kinase", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "cell cycle", "cell polarity", "development", "PAR proteins", "Polo kinase", "symmetry breaking", "zygote"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cues", "Oocytes", "Orientation, Spatial", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066984793", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57195433956": {"Name": "Reich J.D.", "AuthorID": "57195433956", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57195431649": {"Name": "Hubatsch L.", "AuthorID": "57195431649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "56584734600": {"Name": "Illukkumbura R.", "AuthorID": "56584734600", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "23135923400": {"Name": "Peglion F.", "AuthorID": "23135923400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57209257037": {"Name": "Bland T.", "AuthorID": "57209257037", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "57197645466": {"Name": "Hirani N.", "AuthorID": "57197645466", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "6506330025": {"Name": "Goehring N.W.", "AuthorID": "6506330025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
