Most frequently, a translated play is described as a \u201cversion\u201d or \u201cadaptation\u201d, with the term \u201ctranslation\u201d reserved for specialized productions. The translation method most commonly adopted is to commission a source-language expert to prepare a \u201cliteral\u201d translation which is then used by an English-speaking theatre practitioner to produce a playscript for performance. This article examines the incidence of such indirect translation practices, the inconsistencies of the applied terminology, and the relevance for indirect translation in its wider sense, revealing the shadows of translational behaviour even within language pairs, and demonstrating the multiplicity of agents impacting on the ultimate appearance of a text in translation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "indirect translation", "literal translation", "London theatre", "theatre translation", "version"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044725356", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56071353900": {"Name": "Brodie G.", "AuthorID": "56071353900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translation Studies, University College London"}}}
