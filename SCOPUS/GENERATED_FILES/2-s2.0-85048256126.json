However, most studies have focused on lexicalized expressions and have only examined performance at one particular point in time, without examining how performance changes over development. The current study examined the comprehension of novel metaphor and metonymy in individuals with ASDs from a large age range, using both a cross-sectional (Experiment 1) and longitudinal design (Experiment 2). Performance in the ASD group was lower compared to typically developing (TD) controls, across all ages. Importantly, the results from Experiments 1 and 2 showed that, although chronological age was not a good predictor for performance of either novel metaphor or metonymy in the cross-sectional design, performance improved when longitudinal data was considered. Correlations between vocabulary knowledge, visuo-spatial abilities and figurative language comprehension abilities were also explored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASD", "Cross-sectional", "Development", "Longitudinal", "Novel metaphor", "Novel metonymy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048256126", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"14631196700": {"Name": "Van Herwegen J.", "AuthorID": "14631196700", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Kingston University London"}, "14018214900": {"Name": "Rundblad G.", "AuthorID": "14018214900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Communication and Society, King's College London"}}}
