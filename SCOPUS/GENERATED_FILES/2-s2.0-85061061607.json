Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center.Schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses are highly complex and heterogeneous disorders that necessitate multiple lines of scientific inquiry and levels of explanation. In recent years, both computational and phenomenological approaches to the understanding of mental illness have received much interest, and significant progress has been made in both fields. However, there has been relatively little progress bridging investigations in these seemingly disparate fields. In this conceptual review and collaborative project from the 4th Meeting of the International Consortium on Hallucination Research, we aim to facilitate the beginning of such dialogue between fields and put forward the argument that computational psychiatry and phenomenology can in fact inform each other, rather than being viewed as isolated or even incompatible approaches. We begin with an overview of phenomenological observations on the interrelationships between auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH) and delusional thoughts in general, before moving on to review several theoretical frameworks and empirical findings in the computational modeling of AVH. We then relate the computational models to the phenomenological accounts, with a special focus on AVH and delusions that involve the senses of agency and ownership of thought (delusions of thought interference). Finally, we offer some tentative directions for future research, emphasizing the importance of a mutual understanding between separate lines of inquiry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agency", "Computational psychiatry", "Modeling", "Ownership", "Phenomenology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delusions", "Hallucinations", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Thinking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061061607", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56060027200": {"Name": "Humpston C.S.", "AuthorID": "56060027200", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "7102905437": {"Name": "Linden D.E.J.", "AuthorID": "7102905437", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7403935120": {"Name": "Adams R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403935120", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57191140063": {"Name": "Benrimoh D.", "AuthorID": "57191140063", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}, "57194038258": {"Name": "Parr T.", "AuthorID": "57194038258", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7006823993": {"Name": "Broome M.R.", "AuthorID": "7006823993", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Philosophy, Humanities Division, University of Oxford"}, "9037095500": {"Name": "Corlett P.R.", "AuthorID": "9037095500", "AffiliationID": "60017994, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale School of Medicine, Yale University"}, "35076376700": {"Name": "Powers A.R.", "AuthorID": "35076376700", "AffiliationID": "60017994, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale School of Medicine, Yale University"}, "6602286108": {"Name": "Gerrans P.", "AuthorID": "6602286108", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University of Adelaide"}, "25641058400": {"Name": "Horga G.", "AuthorID": "25641058400", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University"}, "6603457207": {"Name": "Pienkos E.", "AuthorID": "6603457207", "AffiliationID": "60014612", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of ProfessionalPsychology, University of Hartford"}, "6602259569": {"Name": "Raballo A.", "AuthorID": "6602259569", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology and Rehabilitation, University of Perugia"}, "7202592948": {"Name": "Rosen C.", "AuthorID": "7202592948", "AffiliationID": "60027561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago"}}}
