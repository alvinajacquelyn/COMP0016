A morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between the tetragonal and pseudocubic phase was found at x = 0.01-0.02. In addition, the relaxor properties were enhanced with increasing the La(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3 content. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra were characterized to elucidate the phase transition behavior. The enhanced ECE (\u0394T = 1.19 K) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 103 pC/N) were obtained for x = 0.01 at room temperature. Meanwhile, the temperature stability of the ECE was considered to be related to the high depolarization temperature and relaxor characteristics of the Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-based ceramics. The above results suggest that the piezoelectric and ECE properties can be simultaneously enhanced by establishing an MPB. These results also demonstrate the great potential of the studied systems for solid-state cooling applications and piezoelectric-based devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 ceramic", "dielectric relaxor", "electrocaloric effect", "lead-free", "piezoelectric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 ceramic", "Dielectric relaxor", "Electro-caloric effects", "Lead-Free", "piezoelectric"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051065137", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56183393700": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "56183393700", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7102948393": {"Name": "Zhai J.", "AuthorID": "7102948393", "AffiliationID": "60073652, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Civil Engineering Materials of Ministry of Education, Functional Materials Research Laboratory, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Tongji University"}, "56727229700": {"Name": "Shen B.", "AuthorID": "56727229700", "AffiliationID": "60073652, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Civil Engineering Materials of Ministry of Education, Functional Materials Research Laboratory, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Tongji University"}, "7401472147": {"Name": "Zeng H.", "AuthorID": "7401472147", "AffiliationID": "60020044, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Inorganic Functional Materials and Devices, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57189993984": {"Name": "Lu B.", "AuthorID": "57189993984", "AffiliationID": "60007155", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Research Center on Smart Materials and Energy Conversion Devices, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Functional Soft Condensed Matter, School of Materials and Energy, Guangdong University of Technology"}, "7404228199": {"Name": "Lu S.", "AuthorID": "7404228199", "AffiliationID": "60007155", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Research Center on Smart Materials and Energy Conversion Devices, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Functional Soft Condensed Matter, School of Materials and Energy, Guangdong University of Technology"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": "112952635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering"}, "7403395240": {"Name": "Yan H.", "AuthorID": "7403395240", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
