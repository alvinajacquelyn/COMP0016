The Authors.The Mw8.4 Illapel earthquake occurred on 16 September was the largest global event in 2015. This earthquake was not unexpected because the hypocenter was located in a seismic gap of the Peru-Chile subduction zone. However, the source model derived from 3-D spectral-element inversion of teleseismic waves reveals a distinct two-stage rupture process with completely different slip characteristics as a composite megathrust event. The two stages were temporally separated. Rupture in the first stage, with a moment magnitude of Mw8.32, built up energetically from the deeper locked zone and propagated in the updip direction toward the trench. Subsequently, the rupture of the second stage, with a magnitude of Mw8.08, mainly occurred in the shallow subduction zone with atypical repeating slip behavior. The unique spatial-temporal rupture evolution presented in this source model is key to further in-depth studies of earthquake physics and source dynamics in subduction systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2015 Illapel earthquake", "seismic wave propagation", "source rupture process", "subduction zone", "two-stage megathrust"], "IndexKeywords": ["Earthquake physics", "Megathrust", "Moment magnitudes", "Source rupture process", "Spatial temporals", "Spectral element", "Subduction zones", "Teleseismic waves"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978920042", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"7601411574": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "7601411574", "AffiliationID": "60011081, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "56398960000": {"Name": "Yeh T.", "AuthorID": "56398960000", "AffiliationID": "60011081, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "54894705300": {"Name": "Lin Y.", "AuthorID": "54894705300", "AffiliationID": "60011081, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "7403681659": {"Name": "Huang B.", "AuthorID": "7403681659", "AffiliationID": "60011081, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "56398769600": {"Name": "Lin T.", "AuthorID": "56398769600", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geosciences, National Taiwan University"}, "7202363863": {"Name": "Song T.", "AuthorID": "7202363863", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
