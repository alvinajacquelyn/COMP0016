The pro-sensor 7 which is not sensitive to Ca2+, contains an alkyne moiety that, upon the click reaction, forms a chelating group involving the 1,4-triazole. Probe 10 exhibited good sensitivity towards calcium (Kd = 5.8 \u03bcM) and zinc (5.6 \u03bcM) with a high dynamic range (65 fold fluorescence increase), high quantum yield (0.59) and showed very low fluorescence enhancement in the presence of a high concentration of Mg2+. We extended this method and generated two dextran conjugates in order to compare their sensing properties with those of the molecular form of 10.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium sensors", "Chelating groups", "Chelating moieties", "Click chemistry", "Fluorescence enhancement", "High dynamic range", "Huisgen cycloaddition", "Sensing property"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920811584", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"22939852900": {"Name": "Collot M.", "AuthorID": "22939852900", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie"}, "57213208311": {"Name": "Wilms C.", "AuthorID": "57213208311", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "35516137100": {"Name": "Mallet J.M.", "AuthorID": "35516137100", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60105758", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR 7203"}}}
