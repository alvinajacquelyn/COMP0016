Paradoxically, a recent paper dismisses the idea of pericytes controlling cerebral blood flow, despite confirming earlier data showing a role for pericytes. We show that these discrepancies are apparent rather than real, and depend on the new paper defining pericytes differently from previous reports. An objective definition of different sub-classes of pericyte along the capillary bed is needed to develop novel therapeutic approaches for stroke and disorders caused by pericyte malfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood-brain barrier", "capillary", "cerebral blood flow", "Pericyte", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Capillaries", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Humans", "Pericytes", "Terminology as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961355183", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7006296522": {"Name": "Attwell D.", "AuthorID": "7006296522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "14066597600": {"Name": "Mishra A.", "AuthorID": "14066597600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56021919000": {"Name": "O'Farrell F.", "AuthorID": "56021919000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57198135061": {"Name": "Hall C.", "AuthorID": "57198135061", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "7005158087": {"Name": "Dalkara T.", "AuthorID": "7005158087", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University"}}}
