Recently, a target product profile was developed that outlines the minimal and optimal characteristics for such an incipient TB test. We describe an evaluation framework for generating evidence to inform the development of policy guidance for the use of such a new test by the World Health Organization. Two research objectives are addressed. 1) The predictive ability of an incipient TB test should be assessed in clinical evaluation studies that include the intended target population and follow-up of sufficient duration to observe whether individuals do or do not progress to clinical TB disease. 2) Studies are needed to evaluate the test under routine programmatic conditions and measure its impact on patient- or health-system-important outcomes. For both research objectives, study designs, methods and analysis are described, with the intent to inform the clinical development plans of test manufacturers, researchers and funders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Tuberculosis", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055617607", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"24449263400": {"Name": "Kik S.V.", "AuthorID": "24449263400", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Dept of Global Health, Academic Medical Center"}, "7004225016": {"Name": "Cobelens F.", "AuthorID": "7004225016", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Dept of Global Health, Academic Medical Center"}, "39062036900": {"Name": "Schumacher S.", "AuthorID": "39062036900", "AffiliationID": "122203587", "AffiliationName": "FIND"}, "7005563544": {"Name": "Boehme C.", "AuthorID": "7005563544", "AffiliationID": "122203587", "AffiliationName": "FIND"}, "23977479300": {"Name": "Denkinger C.M.", "AuthorID": "23977479300", "AffiliationID": "122203587", "AffiliationName": "FIND"}, "7005158262": {"Name": "Cirillo D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005158262", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7004276892": {"Name": "Churchyard G.", "AuthorID": "7004276892", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "Advancing Care and Treatment for TB/HIV, South African Medical Research Council"}, "7004262091": {"Name": "Goletti D.", "AuthorID": "7004262091", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Research Unit, Dept of Epidemiology and Preclinical Research, National Institute for Infectious Diseases"}, "14830408400": {"Name": "Rangaka M.X.", "AuthorID": "14830408400", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "CIDRI-AFRICA, University of Cape Town"}, "57203087999": {"Name": "Lienhardt C.", "AuthorID": "57203087999", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60025735, 60108528, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 Mixte Internationale TransVIHMI (UMI 233 IRD \u2013 U1175 INSERM - Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier), Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD)"}, "7003566620": {"Name": "Gilpin C.", "AuthorID": "7003566620", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global TB Programme, World Health Organization"}, "7006442223": {"Name": "Matteelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006442223", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "WHO Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV Co-infection and TB Elimination, Dept of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia"}}}
