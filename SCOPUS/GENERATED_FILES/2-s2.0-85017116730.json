A particular issue is the disparities in uptake by students\u2019 family background, gender and ethnicity. It remains unclear whether the relationship between student characteristics and choice can be explained by academic disparities, and whether students\u2019 background, gender and ethnicity interact in determining university subject choices, rather than simply having additive effects. I use data from more than 4000 students in England from \u2018Next Steps\u2019 (previously the LSYPE) and logistic regression methods to explore the interacting relationships between student characteristics and subject choice. There are four main findings of this study. Firstly, disparities by students\u2019 ethnicity are shown to increase when controlling for prior attainment. Secondly, family background indicators are differentially related to uptake for male and female students, with parents\u2019 social class and education larger predictors of choice than financial resources. Thirdly, gender, ethnicity and family background interact in determining choices. Particularly, as socio-economic position increases, young women are more likely to choose STEM over other high-return subjects. Finally, associations between student characteristics and subject choices, including interactions, largely persisted when accounting for A-level choices. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A level", "Degree", "ethnicity", "gender", "SES", "STEM", "subject choice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017116730", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57193859109": {"Name": "Codiroli Mcmaster N.", "AuthorID": "57193859109", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}}}
