Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic methods, including 1D-, 2D-NMR, and mass spectrometry. All compounds were evaluated for their amylase secretion activity in human salivary gland cells after treatment in 40 mM of high glucose. All compounds showed increased amylase secretion activity. Moreover, previously undescribed compounds (1\u20132), luteolin 7-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (10), quercimeritrin (11), and quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-D-xylopyranoside (13) exhibited significant amylase activity, which is comparable to the positive control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amylase secretion activity", "Ixeridium dentatum", "phenylethanoid", "sesquiterpene lactone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064164403", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55363021300": {"Name": "Park S.", "AuthorID": "55363021300", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Science Yonsei University"}, "57195405049": {"Name": "Park J.", "AuthorID": "57195405049", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Science Yonsei University"}, "49663477700": {"Name": "Kim S.", "AuthorID": "49663477700", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Science Yonsei University"}, "22951466700": {"Name": "Nhiem N.", "AuthorID": "22951466700", "AffiliationID": "60071359", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Marine Biochemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology"}, "57189714442": {"Name": "Bhattarai K.", "AuthorID": "57189714442", "AffiliationID": "60001187", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Institute of New Drug Development School of Medicine, Chonbuk National University"}, "13604675800": {"Name": "Chae H.", "AuthorID": "13604675800", "AffiliationID": "60001187", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Institute of New Drug Development School of Medicine, Chonbuk National University"}, "57202559644": {"Name": "Kim H.", "AuthorID": "57202559644", "AffiliationID": "60092864", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School, DGIST"}}}
