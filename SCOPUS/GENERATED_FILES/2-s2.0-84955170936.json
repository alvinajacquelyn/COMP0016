Analysis of the first 2.6 million screening invitations found that 54% of eligible people took up the invitation. The reasons for this low uptake are unclear. We investigated whether participation in screening varies according to cognitive ability and personality. Methods Participants were members of The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. In 2010-2011, respondents were asked about participation in bowel cancer screening, and cognitive ability and the 'Big Five' personality traits were assessed. Logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional relationships between cognitive ability and personality and screening participation in 2681 people aged 60-75 years who were eligible to have been invited to take part in the UK national screening programme for bowel cancer. Results In age-adjusted and sex-adjusted analyses, better cognition and higher conscientiousness were associated with increased participation in cancer screening. ORs (95% CIs) per SD increase were 1.10 (1.03 to 1.18) for cognitive ability and 1.10 (1.01 to 1.19) for conscientiousness. After further adjustment for household wealth and health literacy-shown previously to be associated with participation-these associations were attenuated (ORs were 1.07 (1.00 to 1.15) and 1.07 (0.97 to 1.18), respectively). Conclusions We found some indication that better cognitive function and greater conscientiousness may be linked with a slightly increased likelihood of participation in bowel cancer screening. These relationships need investigation in other cohorts of older people.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cognition", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Early Detection of Cancer", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Occult Blood", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Socioeconomic Factors", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955170936", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7102850916": {"Name": "Gale C.R.", "AuthorID": "7102850916", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57193752767": {"Name": "Deary I.J.", "AuthorID": "57193752767", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "David Batty G.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24072448700": {"Name": "Zaninotto P.", "AuthorID": "24072448700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
