In the latter part of the twentieth century, a number of community universities were established in the South of Brazil, characterised by democratic local community involvement, expansion of access in non-metropolitan regions, and close ties with local industry. This article analyses these innovative institutions in relation to the complex demands of the so-called knowledge economy and multifaceted relationships between public and private, exploring the ways in which the public good role of universities manifests itself in relation to the local. Given their hybrid nature\u2013independent from the state but with a public good mission\u2013these institutions can be seen to represent a new model of non-state public higher education. Implications are drawn out for the potential role of these institutions in the current policy context of Brazil, and internationally, in light of their context-specificity and the significant challenges from the highly commercialised for-profit sector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community universities", "Higher education", "hybridism", "local community involvement", "public good"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041629054", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57200545643": {"Name": "Fioreze C.", "AuthorID": "57200545643", "AffiliationID": "60025701", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, University of Passo Fundo"}, "8424780600": {"Name": "McCowan T.", "AuthorID": "8424780600", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
