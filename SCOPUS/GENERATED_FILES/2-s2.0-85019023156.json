These alterations are caused by diminutive changes in the biology of synapses, and ineffective neurotransmission, rather than loss of neurons. Hitherto, only a few studies, exploring molecular mechanisms of healthy brain aging in higher vertebrates, utilized synaptosomal fractions to survey local changes in aging-related transcriptome dynamics. Here we present, for the first time, a comparative analysis of the synaptosomes transcriptome in the aging mouse brain using RNA sequencing. Our results show changes in the expression of genes contributing to biological pathways related to neurite guidance, synaptosomal physiology, and RNA splicing. More intriguingly, we also discovered alterations in the expression of thousands of novel, unannotated lincRNAs during aging. Further, detailed characterization of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor I subunit 1 (Clp1) mRNA and protein expression indicates its increased expression in neuronal processes of hippocampal stratum radiatum in aging mice. Together, our study uncovers a new layer of transcriptional regulation which is targeted by aging within the local environment of interconnecting neuronal cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain aging", "Clp1", "lincRNAs", "RNA-Seq", "Synaptosome", "Transcriptome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Brain", "Cognition", "Gene Expression", "Hippocampus", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phosphotransferases", "Polyadenylation", "RNA Splicing", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA, Untranslated", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Synaptic Transmission", "Synaptosomes", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019023156", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55894641800": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "55894641800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "57191033068": {"Name": "Takenaka K.", "AuthorID": "57191033068", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "57189756043": {"Name": "Bliim N.", "AuthorID": "57189756043", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6602088325": {"Name": "Janitz M.", "AuthorID": "6602088325", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6602616244": {"Name": "Ueberham U.", "AuthorID": "6602616244", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, School of Medicine"}, "6603414656": {"Name": "Kirazov L.", "AuthorID": "6603414656", "AffiliationID": "60024147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Morphology, Pathology and Anthropology with Museum, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}, "6603149307": {"Name": "Kirazov E.", "AuthorID": "6603149307", "AffiliationID": "60024147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Morphology, Pathology and Anthropology with Museum, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}, "57194173581": {"Name": "Knobloch M.", "AuthorID": "57194173581", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, School of Medicine"}, "57194173760": {"Name": "Bochmann J.", "AuthorID": "57194173760", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, School of Medicine"}, "57194171964": {"Name": "Jendrek R.", "AuthorID": "57194171964", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, School of Medicine"}, "16427260600": {"Name": "Arendt T.", "AuthorID": "16427260600", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, School of Medicine"}, "55530992700": {"Name": "Mills J.", "AuthorID": "55530992700", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}}}
