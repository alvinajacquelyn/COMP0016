Using data from 60 age- and IQ-matched men and women with autism (without intellectual disability), we operationalized camouflaging in adults with autism for the first time as the quantitative discrepancy between the person\u2019s \u2018external\u2019 behavioural presentation in social\u2013interpersonal contexts (measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and the person\u2019s \u2018internal\u2019 status (dispositional traits measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient and social cognitive capability measured by the \u2018Reading the Mind in the Eyes\u2019 Test). We found that the operationalized camouflaging measure was not significantly correlated with age or IQ. On average, women with autism had higher camouflaging scores than men with autism (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.98), with substantial variability in both groups. Greater camouflaging was associated with more depressive symptoms in men and better signal-detection sensitivity in women with autism. The neuroanatomical association with camouflaging score was largely sex/gender-dependent and significant only in women: from reverse inference, the most correlated cognitive terms were about emotion and memory. The underlying constructs, measurement, mechanisms, consequences and heterogeneity of camouflaging in autism warrant further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adults", "autism", "brain structure", "camouflage", "camouflaging", "cognition", "coping", "gender", "sex", "sex differences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autistic Disorder", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Social Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026463736", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57211913020": {"Name": "Lai M.C.", "AuthorID": "57211913020", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "National Taiwan University Hospital"}, "57188789189": {"Name": "Szatmari P.", "AuthorID": "57188789189", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "23980659600": {"Name": "Lombardo M.V.", "AuthorID": "23980659600", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}, "37038376900": {"Name": "Ruigrok A.N.V.", "AuthorID": "37038376900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "35253357900": {"Name": "Chakrabarti B.", "AuthorID": "35253357900", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}, "15134853800": {"Name": "Auyeung B.", "AuthorID": "15134853800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}, "7006016927": {"Name": "Baron-Cohen S.", "AuthorID": "7006016927", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004098522": {"Name": "Happ\u00e9 F.", "AuthorID": "7004098522", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
