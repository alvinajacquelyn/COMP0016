All rights reserved.We present a case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with a dry cough, shortness of breath and general malaise. She had presented 5 days previously with a sore throat, feeling feverish and with non-specific symptoms. Her background included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She was initially thought to have decompensated heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation and was initiated on diuretic therapy. However, a transthoracic echocardiogram performed revealed collapse of the right ventricle and a swinging heart, suggestive of cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis where 700 mL of exudative, blood-stained fluid was drained. Subsequent testing of the pericardial fluid revealed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Serial follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms revealed resolution of the pericardial effusion and the patient remained asymptomatic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Cardiac Tamponade", "Dyspnea", "Echocardiography", "Epstein-Barr Virus Infections", "Female", "Herpesvirus 4, Human", "Humans", "Pericardiocentesis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929624760", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56651568200": {"Name": "Ho K.M.A.", "AuthorID": "56651568200", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Care of Older People, Whittington Hospital"}, "7402392232": {"Name": "Mitchell S.C.", "AuthorID": "7402392232", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Care of Older People, Whittington Hospital"}}}
