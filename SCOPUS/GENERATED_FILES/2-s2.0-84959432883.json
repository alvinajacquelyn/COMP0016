In this work, we report a detailed investigation of the effect of water incorporation in BaFeO2.5 on the structure and conductivity. BaFeO2.5 is shown to be topochemically transformed to two different hydrated modifications, low-water (LW-) and high-water (HW-) BaFeO2.5. A combined analysis of neutron and X-ray diffraction data was used to determine the crystal structure of LW-BaFeO2.5 (BaFeO2.33(OH)0.33), which shows a unique ordering pattern of anion vacancies for perovskite type compounds, with structural relaxations around vacancies being similar to the chemically similar compound BaFeO2.33F0.33. Approximate proton positions were determined using the bond valence method. Conductivity studies of hydrated and pure BaFeO2.5 (with additional comparison to oxidized BaFeO2.5) show a significant enhancement of the conductivity on water incorporation, which can be attributed to proton conductivity. This is the first report of significant grain proton conduction (\u223c10-6 to 10-7 S cm-1) in an iron based perovskite. Water uptake is further shown to be completely reversible, with reformation of BaFeO2.5 when heating the compound to temperatures above \u223c450 K under Ar.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bond valence methods", "Combined analysis", "Effect of water", "Hydrogen separation membranes", "Perovskite type", "Proton conducting ceramic", "Proton conduction", "X-ray diffraction data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959432883", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57146913800": {"Name": "Kn\u00f6chel P.L.", "AuthorID": "57146913800", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "Technical University of Darmstadt, Joint Research Laboratory Nanomaterials"}, "55203671400": {"Name": "Loho C.", "AuthorID": "55203671400", "AffiliationID": "60027314", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Nanotechnology"}, "7402381713": {"Name": "Hahn H.", "AuthorID": "7402381713", "AffiliationID": "60027314", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Nanotechnology"}, "24484542900": {"Name": "Clemens O.", "AuthorID": "24484542900", "AffiliationID": "60027314", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Nanotechnology"}, "55631939700": {"Name": "Keenan P.J.", "AuthorID": "55631939700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, School of Chemistry Edgbaston"}, "57198696839": {"Name": "Wright A.J.", "AuthorID": "57198696839", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, School of Chemistry Edgbaston"}, "55138337300": {"Name": "Slater P.R.", "AuthorID": "55138337300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, School of Chemistry Edgbaston"}, "24725518800": {"Name": "Reitz C.", "AuthorID": "24725518800", "AffiliationID": "60027314", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Nanotechnology"}, "36819506400": {"Name": "Witte R.", "AuthorID": "36819506400", "AffiliationID": "60027314", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Nanotechnology"}, "7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Harwell"}}}
