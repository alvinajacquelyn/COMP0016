These quantities are defined in terms of the second-order moment a of the distribution function of the orientation unit vector between hydrodynamically interacting particles. We show, from first principles, that the evolution equation of a contains a source term that accounts for the association and the dissociation of interacting particle pairs. This term provides a microscopic explanation for typical non-Newtonian behavior, observed in experiments in the literature, including normal stress differences in steady shear flow, as well as time-dependent stress after abruptly reversed shear flow and during oscillating shear flow.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Evolution equations", "Interacting particles", "Non-Newtonian behaviors", "Normal stress difference", "Oscillating shear", "Particle Reynolds number", "Second order moment", "Steady shear flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054018544", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"16177628100": {"Name": "Gillissen J.", "AuthorID": "16177628100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35104042400": {"Name": "Wilson H.", "AuthorID": "35104042400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
