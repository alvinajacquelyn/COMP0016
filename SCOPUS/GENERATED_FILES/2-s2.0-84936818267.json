Given the extensive attention paid to patients' (higher order) perceptual function, it is surprising that there have been no systematic analyses of basic oculomotor function in this population. Here 20 patients with posterior cortical atrophy, 17 patients with typical Alzheimer's disease and 22 healthy controls completed tests of fixation, saccade (including fixation/target gap and overlap conditions) and smooth pursuit eye movements using an infrared pupil-tracking system. Participants underwent detailed neuropsychological and neurological examinations, with a proportion also undertaking brain imaging and analysis of molecular pathology. In contrast to informal clinical evaluations of oculomotor dysfunction frequency (previous studies: 38%, current clinical examination: 33%), detailed eyetracking investigations revealed eye movement abnormalities in 80% of patients with posterior cortical atrophy (compared to 17% typical Alzheimer's disease, 5% controls). The greatest differences between posterior cortical atrophy and typical Alzheimer's disease were seen in saccadic performance. Patients with posterior cortical atrophy made significantly shorter saccades especially for distant targets. They also exhibited a significant exacerbation of the normal gap/overlap effect, consistent with 'sticky fixation'. Time to reach saccadic targets was significantly associated with parietal and occipital cortical thickness measures. On fixation stability tasks, patients with typical Alzheimer's disease showed more square wave jerks whose frequency was associated with lower cerebellar grey matter volume, while patients with posterior cortical atrophy showed large saccadic intrusions whose frequency correlated significantly with generalized reductions in cortical thickness. Patients with both posterior cortical atrophy and typical Alzheimer's disease showed lower gain in smooth pursuit compared to controls. The current study establishes that eye movement abnormalities are near-ubiquitous in posterior cortical atrophy, and highlights multiple aspects of saccadic performance which distinguish posterior cortical atrophy from typical Alzheimer's disease. We suggest the posterior cortical atrophy oculomotor profile (e.g. exacerbation of the saccadic gap/overlap effect, preserved saccadic velocity) reflects weak input from degraded occipito-parietal spatial representations of stimulus location into a superior collicular spatial map for eye movement regulation. This may indicate greater impairment of identification of oculomotor targets rather than generation of oculomotor movements. The results highlight the critical role of spatial attention and object identification but also precise stimulus localization in explaining the complex real world perception deficits observed in posterior cortical atrophy and many other patients with dementia-related visual impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agnosia", "Alzheimer's disease", "oculomotor", "parietal lobe", "visual function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Corticomedial Nuclear Complex", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Ocular Motility Disorders", "Pursuit, Smooth", "ROC Curve", "Saccades"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936818267", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55036185800": {"Name": "Shakespeare T.", "AuthorID": "55036185800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55650633000": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "55650633000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56095382000": {"Name": "Slattery C.", "AuthorID": "56095382000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "33467902600": {"Name": "Ryan N.", "AuthorID": "33467902600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6507711283": {"Name": "Kaski D.", "AuthorID": "6507711283", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Charing Cross Hospital"}}}
