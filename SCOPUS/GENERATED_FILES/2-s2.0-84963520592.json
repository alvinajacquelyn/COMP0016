Hence, there is limited understanding of communal settings, such as office environments, as sites for intervention. Even when energy consumption in the workplace has been considered, the emphasis has typically been on the individual. To address this gap, we conducted a study of energy consumption and management in one workplace, based on a combination of workshops with a broad range of stakeholders, and quantitative data inspections. We report and discuss findings from this study, in light of prior literature, and we present a set of implications for design and further research. In particular, three themes, and associated intervention opportunities, emerged from our data: (1) energy wastage related to \"errors\"; (2) the role of company policies and the negotiation that surrounds their implementation; and (3) the bigger energy picture of procurement, construction and travel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buildings", "Energy", "Error", "Public displays", "Sustainability", "Workplace"], "IndexKeywords": ["Company policies", "Energy", "Energy wastages", "Individual behaviour", "Office environments", "Public display", "Quantitative data", "Workplace"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963520592", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"50261047100": {"Name": "Bedwell B.", "AuthorID": "50261047100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Horizon Digital Economy Research, University of Nottingham"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "14016052900": {"Name": "Jewell M.", "AuthorID": "14016052900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}}}
