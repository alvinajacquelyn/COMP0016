To achieve this with optical fiber bundles is extremely challenging, simply because of the sheer number of bundles required, and the associated challenges of weight and ergonomics. Dispensing with optical fiber bundles and moving to head-mounted optoelectronics can potentially facilitate the advent of a new generation of wearable, whole-scalp technologies that will open up a range of new experimental and clinical applications for diffuse opticalmeasurements. Here, we present a concise review of the significant progress that has been made toward achieving a wearable, fiberless, high-density, wholescalp DOT system.We identify the key limitations of current technologies and discuss the possible opportunities for future development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffuse optical tomography", "Fiberless", "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy", "Wearable", "Whole-scalp"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffuse optical tomography", "Fiberless", "Functional near infrared spectroscopy", "Wearable", "Whole-scalp"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032626465", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56470015000": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "56470015000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55793189898": {"Name": "Cooper R.J.", "AuthorID": "55793189898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
