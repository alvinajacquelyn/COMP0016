We have piloted a new, low intensity (LI) CBT intervention specifically designed to be delivered by frontline mental health staff, following brief training, and with ongoing supervision and support. A pilot feasibility study has demonstrated significant improvement in service user outcomes. This study is a qualitative analysis of the experiences of the staff and service users taking part in the evaluation. Aims: To evaluate the acceptability of the training protocol and the therapy, and to examine the factors promoting and restraining implementation. Method: All trained staff and service users completed a semi-structured interview that was transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Service users spoke about learning new skills and achieving their goals. Staff spoke about being able to use a brief, structured intervention to achieve positive outcomes for their clients. Both groups felt that longer, more sophisticated interventions were required to address more complex problems. The positive clinical outcomes motivated therapists to continue using the approach, despite organizational barriers. Conclusions: For both trained staff and service users, taking part in the study was a positive experience. Staff members' perceived skill development and positive reaction to seeing their clients improve should help to promote implementation. Work is needed to clarify whether and how more complex difficulties should be addressed by frontline staff.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CBT", "clinical psychology", "cognitive therapy training", "psychosis", "qualitative methods", "schizophrenia", "service-user satisfaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Cognitive Therapy", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Inservice Training", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Pilot Projects", "Psychotic Disorders", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954486048", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"37073443500": {"Name": "Waller H.", "AuthorID": "37073443500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7004167371": {"Name": "Garety P.", "AuthorID": "7004167371", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "9332406200": {"Name": "Jolley S.", "AuthorID": "9332406200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "10539636700": {"Name": "Fornells-Ambrojo M.", "AuthorID": "10539636700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "University College London, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16064103300": {"Name": "Kuipers E.", "AuthorID": "16064103300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "6506669145": {"Name": "Onwumere J.", "AuthorID": "6506669145", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "36093546200": {"Name": "Woodall A.", "AuthorID": "36093546200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "55243134200": {"Name": "Craig T.", "AuthorID": "55243134200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}}}
