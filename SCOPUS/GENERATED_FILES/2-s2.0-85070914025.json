Both conditions are linked to powerful beliefs in our society that may affect experiences. This study explored how HIV and cancer were represented in UK newspapers to gain insight into the social context of living with a dual diagnosis. We performed an initial content analysis of HIV articles and of cancer articles published in the free London newspapers, The Metro and The Evening Standard between 2012 and 2017, followed by qualitative thematic analysis and in-depth analysis of selected articles of exemplar cases. Both conditions were presented very differently. The underlying subtext was that cancer could happen to any of us. HIV was framed as a potentially dangerous, stigmatising phenomenon affecting \u201cothers\u201d. Popular discourse about HIV within news media remains largely negative and stigmatising. People living with a dual diagnosis of HIV and cancer may choose to prioritise the sharing of the more socially acceptable condition, cancer, in order to access support. The negotiation of cancer healthcare services is likely to be adversely influenced by the social burden of HIV related stigma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "dual diagnosis (non MESH term)", "HIV", "patient experience (non MESH term)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "London", "Neoplasms", "Qualitative Research", "Social Stigma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070914025", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"15829821100": {"Name": "Hainsworth E.G.", "AuthorID": "15829821100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Sciences, Royal Free and University College London Medical School"}, "7006172333": {"Name": "Shahmanesh M.", "AuthorID": "7006172333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, Faculty AHRI"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Sciences, University College London"}}}
