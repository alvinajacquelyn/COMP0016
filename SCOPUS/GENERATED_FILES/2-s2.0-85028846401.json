This will demand efficient stabilization and shipment of cell products. However, cryopreservation science is poorly understood by life-scientists in general and in recent decades only limited progress has been made in the technology of preservation and storage of cells. Rapid translation of new developments to a broader range of cell types will be vital, as will assuring a deeper knowledge of the fundamental cell biology relating to successful preservation and recovery of cell cultures. This report presents expert consensus on these and other issues which need to be addressed for more efficient delivery of cell therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell therapy", "Cold-chain", "Cryostorage", "Preservation", "Regenerative medicine", "Stability", "Vitrification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Survival", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Cryopreservation", "Cryoprotective Agents", "Humans", "Time Factors", "Transportation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028846401", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"]], "AuthorData": {"7102445556": {"Name": "Stacey G.N.", "AuthorID": "7102445556", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "UK Stem Cell Bank, Division of Advanced Therapies, NIBSC"}, "57203083074": {"Name": "Hunt C.J.", "AuthorID": "57203083074", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "UK Stem Cell Bank, Division of Advanced Therapies, NIBSC"}, "57195227806": {"Name": "Man J.", "AuthorID": "57195227806", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "UK Stem Cell Bank, Division of Advanced Therapies, NIBSC"}, "7003429732": {"Name": "Connon C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003429732", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, University of Newcastle"}, "6505456632": {"Name": "Coopman K.", "AuthorID": "6505456632", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "57208543394": {"Name": "Dickson A.J.", "AuthorID": "57208543394", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester"}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University College London"}, "7102163325": {"Name": "Kemp P.", "AuthorID": "7102163325", "AffiliationID": "60112709", "AffiliationName": "Intercytex Ltd., HairClone"}, "15752160300": {"Name": "Ward S.", "AuthorID": "15752160300", "AffiliationID": "60112709", "AffiliationName": "Intercytex Ltd., HairClone"}, "7005130496": {"Name": "Kerby J.", "AuthorID": "7005130496", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Cell Therapy Manufacturing Development, Pfizer"}, "6602448229": {"Name": "Matejtschuk P.", "AuthorID": "6602448229", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Standardisation Science, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) a Centre of the MHRA"}, "7202286939": {"Name": "Moore H.", "AuthorID": "7202286939", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sheffield"}, "57198621992": {"Name": "Morris J.", "AuthorID": "57198621992", "AffiliationID": "60106890", "AffiliationName": "Asymptote (GE Healthcare)"}, "7004135804": {"Name": "Oreffo R.O.C.", "AuthorID": "7004135804", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regeneration, University of Southampton"}, "23028495000": {"Name": "Slater N.", "AuthorID": "23028495000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "57195564282": {"Name": "Wiggins C.", "AuthorID": "57195564282", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "National Health Service - Blood and Transplant"}, "7402793099": {"Name": "Zimmermann H.", "AuthorID": "7402793099", "AffiliationID": "60029195", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Norte"}}}
