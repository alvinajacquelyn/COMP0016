However, there are no historical examples or current models to emulate. Scholarly analyses of putative initiatives to green industrialisation, especially in developing countries, are few and limited. This article explores the conception and implementation of green industrialisation in Ethiopia, one of the world's poorest nations, where an ambitious Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy has been created, alongside a multi-sectoral Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), to leapfrog environmentally unsustainable development and bring the country to middle-income status by 2025. Using the socio-technical transition (STT) perspective and in particular Smith, Stirling, and Berkhout (2005) framework for assessing sustainable transition programmes, it analyzes the \u2018selection pressures\u2019 on the industrial \u2018regime\u2019 and its \u2018adaptive capacity\u2019. It finds: (i) clear articulation of the imperative for climate change mitigation and economic growth; (ii) strong high-level government commitment to a greening agenda within the context of accelerated industrialisation; and (iii) a nascent innovation system that is beginning to evolve according to these priorities. However, the analysis also identifies important challenges, including: coordination mechanisms between different stakeholders; framing issues; availability of resources; and ongoing tension between addressing climate change and promoting economic growth. It also highlights the importance of the availability of cross-border resources for purposive sustainability transition within low-income countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethiopia", "Green economy", "Industrialisation", "Low-carbon", "Sustainability transition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058213417", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"33568129300": {"Name": "Okereke C.", "AuthorID": "33568129300", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Reading University"}, "57190883101": {"Name": "Coke A.", "AuthorID": "57190883101", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Kingston University London"}, "57204973475": {"Name": "Geebreyesus M.", "AuthorID": "57204973475", "AffiliationID": "106773733", "AffiliationName": "Ethiopia Development Research Institute (EDRI)"}, "8937431200": {"Name": "Ginbo T.", "AuthorID": "8937431200", "AffiliationID": "106773733", "AffiliationName": "Ethiopia Development Research Institute (EDRI)"}, "36160567000": {"Name": "Wakeford J.", "AuthorID": "36160567000", "AffiliationID": "121795932", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Global Research Lab, Switzerland & Stellenbosch University"}, "6602891448": {"Name": "Mulugetta Y.", "AuthorID": "6602891448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "STEaPP, University College London"}}}
