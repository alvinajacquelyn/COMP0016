We provided the first national forecasts for Italy and the Unites States of America (USA) and quantified direct cost of caring for these increasingly complex patients. Methods and Setting We adapted an individual-based model of ageing HIV-positive patients to Italy and the USA, which followed patients on HIV-treatment as they aged and developed NCDs (chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, non-AIDS malignancies, myocardial infarctions and strokes). The models were parameterised using data on 7,469 HIV-positive patients from the Italian Cohort Na\u00efve to Antiretrovirals Foundation Study and 3,748 commercially- insured patients in the USA and extrapolated to national level using national surveillance data. Results The model predicted that mean age of HIV-positive patients will increase from 46 to 59 in Italy and from 49 to 58 in the USA in 2015-2035. The proportion of patients in Italy and the USA diagnosed with \u22651 NCD is estimated to increase from 64% and 71% in 2015 to 89% and 89% by 2035, respectively, driven by moderate cardiovascular disease (CVD) (hypertension and dyslipidaemia), diabetes and malignancies in both countries. NCD treatment costs as a proportion of total direct HIV costs will increase from 11% to 23% in Italy and from 40% to 56% in the USA in 2015-2035. Conclusions HIV patient profile in Italy and the USA is shifting to older patients diagnosed with multiple co-morbidity. This will increase NCD treatment costs and require multi-disciplinary patient management.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Models, Theoretical", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032204080", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55260740800": {"Name": "Smit M.", "AuthorID": "55260740800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College"}, "57196187004": {"Name": "Cassidy R.", "AuthorID": "57196187004", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College"}, "35614255000": {"Name": "Hallett T.B.", "AuthorID": "35614255000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7003963460": {"Name": "Quiros-Roldan E.", "AuthorID": "7003963460", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and Brescia Spedali Civili General Hospital"}, "35378297800": {"Name": "Castelli F.", "AuthorID": "35378297800", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and Brescia Spedali Civili General Hospital"}, "7007115968": {"Name": "Girardi E.", "AuthorID": "7007115968", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Unit, National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Lazzaro Spallanzani'"}, "23767693100": {"Name": "Mammone A.", "AuthorID": "23767693100", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Unit, National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Lazzaro Spallanzani'"}, "57203678052": {"Name": "Antinori A.", "AuthorID": "57203678052", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Department, National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Lazzaro Spallanzani'"}, "7003735127": {"Name": "Saracino A.", "AuthorID": "7003735127", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Bari"}, "35097094900": {"Name": "Bai F.", "AuthorID": "35097094900", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, University of Milan"}, "34572443100": {"Name": "Monforte A.A.", "AuthorID": "34572443100", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, University of Milan"}, "7005846988": {"Name": "Rusconi S.", "AuthorID": "7005846988", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, DIBIC 'Luigi Sacco', University of Milan"}, "17635312100": {"Name": "Magnani G.", "AuthorID": "17635312100", "AffiliationID": "60007505", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, S.
