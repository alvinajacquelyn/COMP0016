Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. All rights reserved.Lifetime prevalence of psychotic disorders varies widely across studies. Epidemiological surveys have rarely examined prevalences of specific psychotic disorders other than schizophrenia, and the majority used a single-phase design without employing clinical reappraisal interview for diagnostic verification. The current study investigated lifetime prevalence, correlates and service utilization of schizophrenia-spectrum, affective, and other non-affective psychotic disorders in a representative sample of community-dwelling Chinese adult population aged 16-75 years (N = 5719) based on a territory-wide, population-based household survey for mental disorders in Hong Kong. The survey adopted a 2-phase design comprising first-phase psychosis screening and second-phase diagnostic verification incorporating clinical information from psychiatrist-administered semi-structured interview and medical record review to ascertain DSM-IV lifetime diagnosis for psychotic disorders. Data on sociodemographics, psychosocial characteristics and service utilization were collected. Our results showed that lifetime prevalence was 2.47% for psychotic disorder overall, 1.25% for schizophrenia, 0.15% for delusional disorder, 0.38% for psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, 0.31% for bipolar disorder with psychosis, and 0.33% for depressive disorder with psychosis. Schizophrenia-spectrum disorder was associated with family history of psychosis, cigarette smoking and variables indicating socioeconomic disadvantage. Victimization experiences were significantly related to affective psychoses and other non-affective psychoses. Around 80% of participants with any psychotic disorder sought some kind of professional help for mental health problems in the past year. Using comprehensive diagnostic assessment involving interview and record data, our results indicate that approximately 2.5% of Chinese adult population had lifetime psychotic disorder which represents a major public health concern.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affective psychoses", "epidemiology", "lifetime prevalence", "population surveys", "schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affective Disorders, Psychotic", "Aged", "Female", "Hong Kong", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032567635", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26643706700": {"Name": "Chang W.C.", "AuthorID": "26643706700", "AffiliationID": "60114496, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hong Kong"}, "36862843700": {"Name": "Wong C.S.M.", "AuthorID": "36862843700", "AffiliationID": "60006541, 60033020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital"}, "57200371582": {"Name": "Chen E.Y.H.", "AuthorID": "57200371582", "AffiliationID": "60114496, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hong Kong"}, "16400525900": {"Name": "Chan W.C.", "AuthorID": "16400525900", "AffiliationID": "60006541, 60033020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital"}, "34573429300": {"Name": "Sham P.C.", "AuthorID": "34573429300", "AffiliationID": "60114496, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hong Kong"}, "57200364686": {"Name": "Lee E.H.M.", "AuthorID": "57200364686", "AffiliationID": "60006541, 60033020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital"}, "7201984627": {"Name": "Lam L.C.W.", "AuthorID": "7201984627", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "24447976700": {"Name": "Chiu H.F.K.", "AuthorID": "24447976700", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "7102153803": {"Name": "Ng R.M.K.", "AuthorID": "7102153803", "AffiliationID": "60023543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Kowloon Hospital"}, "7201936267": {"Name": "Hung S.F.", "AuthorID": "7201936267", "AffiliationID": "60032219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Kwai Chung Hospital"}, "51763202900": {"Name": "Chan L.K.", "AuthorID": "51763202900", "AffiliationID": "60032219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Kwai Chung Hospital"}, "47061904500": {"Name": "Leung J.S.Y.", "AuthorID": "47061904500", "AffiliationID": "60032219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Kwai Chung Hospital"}, "57214583163": {"Name": "Cheung E.F.C.", "AuthorID": "57214583163", "AffiliationID": "60024330", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital"}, "35299869000": {"Name": "Lam M.", "AuthorID": "35299869000", "AffiliationID": "60024330", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital"}, "55177901800": {"Name": "Chiang T.P.", "AuthorID": "55177901800", "AffiliationID": "60024330", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital"}, "57196296728": {"Name": "Lau G.K.W.", "AuthorID": "57196296728", "AffiliationID": "60017998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tai Po Hospital"}, "55477272900": {"Name": "Lee A.T.C.", "AuthorID": "55477272900", "AffiliationID": "60017998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tai Po Hospital"}, "22980588600": {"Name": "Leung G.T.Y.", "AuthorID": "22980588600", "AffiliationID": "60017998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tai Po Hospital"}, "26643560600": {"Name": "Lau J.T.F.", "AuthorID": "26643560600", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "7102358027": {"Name": "Van Os J.", "AuthorID": "7102358027", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Maastricht University"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57204025589": {"Name": "Bebbington P.", "AuthorID": "57204025589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
