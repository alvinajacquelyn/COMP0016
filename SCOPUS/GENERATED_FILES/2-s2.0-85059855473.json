Such an approach, however, leaves little scope for identification of the less specialised exploitation of animals for traction during the European Neolithic. This study presents zooarchaeological evidence - in the form of sub-pathological alterations to cattle foot bones - for the exploitation of cattle for the occasional pulling of heavy loads, or 'light' traction. The analysis and systematic comparison of material from 11 Neolithic sites in the Western Balkans (c. 6100-4500 cal BC) provides the earliest direct evidence for the use of cattle for such a purpose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Balkans", "domestic cattle", "Neolithic", "pathology", "traction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059855473", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"56398521500": {"Name": "Gaastra J.S.", "AuthorID": "56398521500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Archaeology"}, "7005963340": {"Name": "Greenfield H.J.", "AuthorID": "7005963340", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "University of Manitoba, Department of Anthropology"}, "16644296400": {"Name": "Linden M.V.", "AuthorID": "16644296400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Archaeology"}}}
