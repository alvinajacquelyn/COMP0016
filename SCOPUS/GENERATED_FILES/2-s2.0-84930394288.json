A particularly effective form of learning in this context is an immersive, sensory approach we can describe as 'inhabiting'. This article illustrates the role that inhabiting plays in facilitating the mobility of the planning model of sustainable urbanism. To do so, it draws on research carried out in the industry of international private sector architects, planners and engineering consultants, sometimes called the Global Intelligence Corps (GIC). In the article, I illustrate how the GIC use inhabiting, drawing on visual media and personal experience to encourage their clients to incorporate sustainable urban planning and design proposals into large urban development projects. These explorations demonstrate the value of research methodologies that focus on the everyday practices and social interactions through which people mobilize ideas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASSEMBLAGE", "GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE CORPS", "POLICY MOBILITIES", "SUSTAINABLE URBANISM"], "IndexKeywords": ["ASSEMBLAGE", "Engineering consultants", "Global intelligence", "International mobilities", "International travel", "Research methodologies", "Social interactions", "SUSTAINABLE URBANISM"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930394288", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55453967300": {"Name": "Rapoport E.", "AuthorID": "55453967300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology Engineering and Public Policy, University College London, Boston House"}}}
