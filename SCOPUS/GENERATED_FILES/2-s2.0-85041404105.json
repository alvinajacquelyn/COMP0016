We investigated how students\u2019 concepts of frailty and delirium changed following a new geriatric medicine module at Manchester medical school. Materials and methods: Semi-structured interviews were used with students before and after the new teaching week to explore changes in attitude towards frailty and delirium and their conceptualisation. Final year students who had not completed the module were interviewed as a comparison group. Grounded theory and content clouds were employed for data analysis. Results: Ten 4th year and 11 final year students were interviewed. After the teaching week, 4th year students had a richer conceptualisation of frailty and delirium. Students described structured assessments such as comprehensive geriatric assessment and expressed confidence in their use. Their frameworks were more developed than the final year students who had not had such teaching. Attitudes towards older people, frailty, delirium, and the specialty of geriatric medicine improved following the teaching week. Conclusion: This study shows that geriatric medicine teaching improves students\u2019 conceptualisation of frailty and delirium and their understanding of the importance of structured assessments and management plans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delirium", "Frailty", "Undergraduate medical education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041404105", "SubjectAreas": [["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56695096000": {"Name": "Nimmons D.", "AuthorID": "56695096000", "AffiliationID": "60009274", "AffiliationName": "Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "36834069700": {"Name": "Pattison T.", "AuthorID": "36834069700", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200496509": {"Name": "O\u2019Neill P.", "AuthorID": "57200496509", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
