Lumenal calcium depletion, incurred during normal cell signaling, stands out as a notable exception to this resilience, promoting a rapid and reversible shift towards a more reducing poise. Calcium depletion induced ER redox alterations are relevant to physiological conditions associated with calcium signaling, such as the response of pancreatic cells to secretagogues and neuronal activity. The core components of the ER redox machinery are well characterized; however, the molecular basis for the calcium-depletion induced shift in redox balance is presently obscure. Results: In vitro, the core machinery for generating disulfides, consisting of ERO1 and the oxidizing protein disulfide isomerase, PDI1A, was indifferent to variation in calcium concentration within the physiological range. However, ER calcium depletion in vivo led to a selective 2.5-fold decline in PDI1A mobility, whereas the mobility of the reducing PDI family member, ERdj5 was unaffected. In vivo, fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements revealed that declining PDI1A mobility correlated with formation of a complex with the abundant ER chaperone calreticulin, whose mobility was also inhibited by calcium depletion and the calcium depletion-mediated reductive shift was attenuated in cells lacking calreticulin. Measurements with purified proteins confirmed that the PDI1A-calreticulin complex dissociated as Ca2+ concentrations approached those normally found in the ER lumen ([Ca2+]K0.5max = 190 \u03bcM). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that selective sequestration of PDI1A in a calcium depletion-mediated complex with the abundant chaperone calreticulin attenuates the effective concentration of this major lumenal thiol oxidant, providing a plausible and simple mechanism for the observed shift in ER lumenal redox poise upon physiological calcium depletion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium", "Calreticulin", "Endoplasmic reticulum", "Fluorescence lifetime imaging", "Protein disulfide isomerase", "Redox"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Calreticulin", "Cercopithecus aethiops", "COS Cells", "Diffusion", "Disulfides", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "HEK293 Cells", "HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Mice", "Molecular Chaperones", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Protein Binding", "Protein Disulfide-Isomerases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924613166", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"15724225000": {"Name": "Avezov E.", "AuthorID": "15724225000", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "55461812200": {"Name": "Konno T.", "AuthorID": "55461812200", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "36168824700": {"Name": "Zyryanova A.", "AuthorID": "36168824700", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "56545776300": {"Name": "Crespillo-Casado A.", "AuthorID": "56545776300", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "7006492977": {"Name": "Harding H.P.", "AuthorID": "7006492977", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "35600270900": {"Name": "Ron D.", "AuthorID": "35600270900", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "56544799800": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "56544799800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "56545241500": {"Name": "Laine R.", "AuthorID": "56545241500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "7003673210": {"Name": "Kaminski C.F.", "AuthorID": "7003673210", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "56545271900": {"Name": "Melo P.P.", "AuthorID": "56545271900", "AffiliationID": "60002144", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biomedical Research, Universidade do Algarve"}, "24482739400": {"Name": "Ushioda R.", "AuthorID": "24482739400", "AffiliationID": "60017585", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Kyoto Sangyo University"}, "35416356700": {"Name": "Nagata K.", "AuthorID": "35416356700", "AffiliationID": "60017585", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Kyoto Sangyo University"}}}
