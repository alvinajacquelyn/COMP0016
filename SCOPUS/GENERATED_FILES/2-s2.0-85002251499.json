APIs of low, medium and high solubility were formulated at low and high loadings (15 and 40% w/w, respectively) with PVP as binder (5%) and MCC as the major excipient. L/S corresponding to the maximum torque produced during wet massing in the MTR, L/S(maxT), was 0.8 for the low solubility APIs, which decreased to 0.6 for some of the more soluble APIs, especially at high loadings. Formulations extruded-spheronised at L/SmaxT) produced pellets of acceptable size (between 900 and 1400 um) for all formulations, but mostly of unacceptable shape (dumb-bells of aspect ratio 1.2). Increasing L/S by 25% successfully produced spherical or near-spherical (aspect ratio 1.1) pellets for all formulations except one of the highly soluble APIs (piracetam) at high loading. Overall, MTR was demonstrated to be a useful pre-formulation and optimization tool in extrusion-spheronisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Extrusionspheronisation", "Liquid-solid ratio", "Mixer torque rheometry", "Pre-formulation", "Wet granulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Particle Size", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Plethysmography, Impedance", "Solubility", "Surface Properties", "Technology, Pharmaceutical", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002251499", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55382194800": {"Name": "Kuhs M.", "AuthorID": "55382194800", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick"}, "57192249808": {"Name": "Moore J.", "AuthorID": "57192249808", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick"}, "57192235652": {"Name": "Kollamaram G.", "AuthorID": "57192235652", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick"}, "35583992400": {"Name": "Walker G.", "AuthorID": "35583992400", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick"}, "26221033900": {"Name": "Croker D.", "AuthorID": "26221033900", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick"}}}
