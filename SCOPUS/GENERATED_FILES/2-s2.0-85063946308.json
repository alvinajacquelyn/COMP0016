It therefore finds frequent use in molecular biology for probing DNA and RNA structures and conformational dynamics. However, detailed understanding of the processes responsible for fluorescence quenching remains largely elusive on a fundamental level. Although attempts have been made to ascribe decreased excited-state lifetimes to intrastrand charge-transfer and stacking interactions, possible influences from dynamic interstrand H-bonding have been widely ignored. Here, we investigate the electronic relaxation of UV-excited 2AP\u00b7T in Watson-Crick (WC) and Hoogsteen (HS) conformations. Although the WC conformation features slowed-down, monomer-like electronic relaxation in \u03c4 \u223c 1.6 ns toward ground-state recovery and triplet formation, the dynamics associated with 2AP\u00b7T in the HS motif exhibit faster deactivation in \u03c4 \u223c 70 ps. As recent research has revealed abundant transient interstrand H-bonding in the Hoogsteen motif for duplex DNA, the established model for dynamic fluorescence quenching may need to be revised in the light of our results. The underlying supramolecular photophysical mechanisms are discussed in terms of a proposed excited-state double-proton transfer as an efficient deactivation channel for recovery of the HS species in the electronic ground state.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conformational dynamics", "Deactivation channel", "Electronic ground state", "Electronic relaxation", "Electronic relaxation dynamics", "Excited state double proton transfers", "Excited state lifetimes", "Ground state recovery", "2-Aminopurine", "Base Pairing", "DNA", "Electrons", "Molecular Conformation", "Photochemical Processes", "Quantum Theory", "Thymine", "Ultraviolet Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063946308", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57190802028": {"Name": "B\u00f6hnke H.", "AuthorID": "57190802028", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel"}, "49962275200": {"Name": "R\u00f6ttger K.", "AuthorID": "49962275200", "AffiliationID": "60112856", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Innovation, Wilton Centre"}, "57203278493": {"Name": "Bohnsack M.", "AuthorID": "57203278493", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel"}, "8332904600": {"Name": "Schwalb N.K.", "AuthorID": "8332904600", "AffiliationID": "60006680", "AffiliationName": "Bayer AG, Consumer Health Division"}, "56550256200": {"Name": "Temps F.", "AuthorID": "56550256200", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel"}, "57073033200": {"Name": "Ingle R.A.", "AuthorID": "57073033200", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Ultrarapide (LSU), Lausanne Centre for Ultrafast Science (LACUS), ISIC, FSB"}, "56433543000": {"Name": "Marroux H.J.B.", "AuthorID": "56433543000", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "7004188245": {"Name": "Orr-Ewing A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004188245", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}}}
