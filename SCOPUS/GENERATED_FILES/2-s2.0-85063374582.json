Each disease is associated with a distinct genetic mutation and with a different pathogenesis and clinical course. Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is common and epitomized by multiple neurofibromas with widespread complications. NF2 and schwannomatosis are rare diseases that are typified by multiple schwannomas that are particularly painful in people with schwannomatosis. Since 1985, the Children's Tumor Foundation (formerly the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation) has hosted an international Neurofibromatosis Conference, bringing together international participants who are focused on NF research and clinical care. The 2017 Conference, held in Washington, DC, was among the largest gatherings of NF researchers to date and included presentations from clinicians and basic scientists, highlighting new data regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying each of these diseases as well as results from clinical studies and clinical trials. This article summarizes the findings presented at the meeting and represents the current state-of-the art for NF research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["neurofibromatosis 1", "neurofibromatosis 2", "schwannomatosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Susceptibility", "Humans", "Neurilemmoma", "Neurofibromatoses", "Neurofibromatosis 1", "Neurofibromatosis 2", "Skin Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063374582", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"35447335500": {"Name": "Ferner R.E.", "AuthorID": "35447335500", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neurofibromatosis Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and King's College London"}, "7201772285": {"Name": "Bakker A.", "AuthorID": "7201772285", "AffiliationID": "102025092", "AffiliationName": "Children's Tumor Foundation"}, "6603745650": {"Name": "Elgersma Y.", "AuthorID": "6603745650", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "56484938700": {"Name": "Evans D.G.R.", "AuthorID": "56484938700", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre (MAHSC), Division of Evolution and Genomic Science, University of Manchester"}, "57105885400": {"Name": "Smith M.J.", "AuthorID": "57105885400", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre (MAHSC), Division of Evolution and Genomic Science, University of Manchester"}, "57200749292": {"Name": "Giovannini M.", "AuthorID": "57200749292", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Head and Neck Surgery, University of California"}, "57205906465": {"Name": "Legius E.", "AuthorID": "57205906465", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, University Hospital Leuven"}, "8741670400": {"Name": "Lloyd A.", "AuthorID": "8741670400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "55780040400": {"Name": "Messiaen L.M.", "AuthorID": "55780040400", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genomics Laboratory, Department of Genetics, University of Alabama"}, "7203070176": {"Name": "Plotkin S.", "AuthorID": "7203070176", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7004723348": {"Name": "Reilly K.M.", "AuthorID": "7004723348", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Rare Tumors Initiative, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health"}, "9248819100": {"Name": "Schindeler A.", "AuthorID": "9248819100", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Research & Biotechnology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "6603729191": {"Name": "Ullrich N.J.", "AuthorID": "6603729191", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "6701380530": {"Name": "Widemann B.", "AuthorID": "6701380530", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute"}, "7202031560": {"Name": "Sherman L.S.", "AuthorID": "7202031560", "AffiliationID": "60005246, 60016733", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center, and Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University"}}}
