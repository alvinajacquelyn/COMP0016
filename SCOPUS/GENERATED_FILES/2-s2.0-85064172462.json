This is not only conceptually problematic but also presents a practical management problem. As a response, a practice-based approach, which relies on a \u201cbecoming\u201d ontology, is adopted for a practical explanation of design coordination for more effective design management. The adopted methodology suggests that design develops as a result of unfolding (path-dependent) individual actions and interdisciplinary interactions. Based on this, the concept of a \u201cshared sense of purposefulness\u201d is proposed to refer to the temporary and precarious organizational state of a design team in which each of the interacting team members has achieved a state of purposefulness to resume individual action. Hence, design coordination in construction is redefined as continuously re-establishing and maintaining \u201ca shared sense of purposefulness\u201d. The concept\u2019s usefulness for understanding the practice of design coordination is demonstrated using data collected from a project in the UK. The discussion enables fresh insights into the everyday operation of design coordination. It is concluded that the proposed conception paves a way forward both for the research and practice in construction design management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["construction", "Design coordination", "design management", "organizational analysis", "practice-based study", "sensemaking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design coordination", "Design management", "Organizational analysis", "practice-based study", "Sensemaking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064172462", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"56422214000": {"Name": "\u00c7\u0131d\u0131k M.", "AuthorID": "56422214000", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment and Architecture, London South Bank University"}, "55909644400": {"Name": "Boyd D.", "AuthorID": "55909644400", "AffiliationID": "60100434", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and the Built Environment, Birmingham City University"}}}
