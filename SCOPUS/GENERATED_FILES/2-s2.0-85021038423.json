However, there remains a lack of information about the conservation value of secondary savannas. Here, we conducted a camera trap survey to assess the effect of secondary vegetation on large mammals in a Brazilian Cerrado protected area, using a single-season occupancy framework to investigate the response of individual species (species-level models) and of all species combined (community-level models). In addition, we investigated the cost effectiveness of different sampling designs to monitor globally threatened species in the study area. At the community level, savanna that regenerated from eucalyptus plantation had similar occupancy estimate as old growth areas. At the species level, none of the ten species individually assessed seemed to respond to succession stage, with greater support for the effect of other covariates on occupancy, such as distance from water and vegetation physiognomy. These results demonstrate that secondary vegetation does not appear to negatively impact large mammals in the study area and suggest that, given a favorable context, Cerrado mammals can recolonize and use secondary savannas that regenerated from clearcut. However, our study area should be considered a best-case scenario, as it retained key ecological attributes of high-value secondary habitats. Our simulations showed that a sampling design with 60 camera trap sites surveyed during nine occasions is appropriate to monitor most globally threatened species in the study area, and could be a useful starting point for new monitoring initiatives in other Cerrado areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["camera trap", "Minas Gerais", "occupancy analysis", "secondary vegetation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021038423", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"56304529300": {"Name": "Ferreira G.B.", "AuthorID": "56304529300", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "56306151900": {"Name": "Oliveira M.J.R.", "AuthorID": "56306151900", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Ecologia, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Manejo da Vida Silvestre, Departamento de Biologia Geral, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "57194187438": {"Name": "de Pinho F.F.", "AuthorID": "57194187438", "AffiliationID": "60022764", "AffiliationName": "Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Ecologia de Biomas Tropicais, Departamento de Biodiversidade, Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o e Meio Ambiente, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto"}, "15764680500": {"Name": "Barata I.M.", "AuthorID": "15764680500", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "24491824300": {"Name": "Collen B.", "AuthorID": "24491824300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "7007098992": {"Name": "Carbone C.", "AuthorID": "7007098992", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7006822063": {"Name": "Ahumada J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006822063", "AffiliationID": "60030089", "AffiliationName": "Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network, The Betty and Gordon Moore Center for Science, Conservation International"}}}
