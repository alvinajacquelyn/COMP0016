In this work, conductive graphene hybrid films, consisting of a metallic network fully encapsulated between monolayer graphene and quartz-glass substrate, were fabricated and characterized for their electromagnetic interference shielding capabilities. Experimental results show that by integration with a metallic network the sheet resistance of graphene was significantly suppressed from 813.27 to 5.53 \u03a9/sq with an optical transmittance at 91%. Consequently, the microwave shielding effectiveness (SE) exceeded 23.60 dB at the Ku-band and 13.48 dB at the Ka-band. The maximum SE value was 28.91 dB at 12 GHz. Compared with the SE of pristine monolayer graphene (3.46 dB), the SE of graphene hybrid film was enhanced by 25.45 dB (99.7% energy attenuation). At 94% optical transmittance, the sheet resistance was 20.67 \u03a9/sq and the maximum SE value was 20.86 dB at 12 GHz. Our results show that hybrid graphene films incorporate both high conductivity and superior electromagnetic shielding comparable to existing ITO shielding modalities. The combination of high conductivity and shielding along with the materials' earth-abundant nature, and facile large-scale fabrication, make these graphene hybrid films highly attractive for transparent EMI shielding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EMI shielding", "Graphene", "Hybrid film", "Metallic network", "Optical transparency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electromagnetic interference shielding", "EMI shielding", "Hybrid film", "Large-scale fabrication", "Optical transparency", "Quartz glass substrates", "Shielding performance", "Technological significance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032576045", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57189468160": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "57189468160", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "11638909100": {"Name": "Lu Z.", "AuthorID": "11638909100", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Ultra-Precision Optical and Electronic Instrument Engineering Centre, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55618634800": {"Name": "Tan J.", "AuthorID": "55618634800", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Ultra-Precision Optical and Electronic Instrument Engineering Centre, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "36078360500": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "36078360500", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Ultra-Precision Optical and Electronic Instrument Engineering Centre, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "7401929226": {"Name": "Ding X.", "AuthorID": "7401929226", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Ultra-Precision Optical and Electronic Instrument Engineering Centre, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57190382555": {"Name": "Black N.", "AuthorID": "57190382555", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "55767739200": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "55767739200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "16218796100": {"Name": "Gallop J.", "AuthorID": "16218796100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "34769536200": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "34769536200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
