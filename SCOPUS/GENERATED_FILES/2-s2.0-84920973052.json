Different growth factor loading has been investigated for enhanced bone regeneration. The platelet is a cellular component of blood which naturally contains a pool of necessary growth factors that mediate initiation, continuation, and completion of cellular mechanism of healing. In this work, we have investigated the encapsulation and immobilization of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with natural polymers like hyaluronic acid (HA) and gelatin (Gel) and loading them in a biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffold, for a synthetic-allologous hybrid scaffold. Effect of PRP addition in small doses was evaluated for osteogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. BCP (10%) mixed HA-Gel hydrogel with or without PRP, was loaded into a BCP sponge scaffold. We investigated the hydrogel-induced improvement in mechanical property and PRP-mediated enhancement in biocompatibility. In vitro studies for cytotoxicity, cell attachment, and proliferation were carried out using MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells. In in vitro studies, the cell count, cell proliferation, and cell survival were higher in the scaffold with PRP loading than without PRP. However, in the in vivo studies using a rat model, the PRP scaffold was not superior to the scaffold without PRP. This discrepancy was investigated in terms of the interaction of PRP in the in vivo environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biphasic calcium phosphate", "bone substitutes", "gelatin", "Hyaluronic acid", "platelet-rich plasma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biphasic calcium phosphates", "Bone defect healing", "Bone substitutes", "Cellular mechanisms", "gelatin", "Growth factor delivery", "Osteogenic potential", "Platelet rich plasma", "3T3 Cells", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Bone Regeneration", "Bone Substitutes", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Gelatin", "Growth Substances", "Humans", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Hydrogel", "Hydroxyapatites", "Male", "Materials Testing", "Mice", "Platelet-Rich Plasma", "Porosity", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920973052", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55572743900": {"Name": "Son S.", "AuthorID": "55572743900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Regenerative Medicine"}, "55846388000": {"Name": "Padalhin A.", "AuthorID": "55846388000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Regenerative Medicine"}, "56945873000": {"Name": "Kim B.", "AuthorID": "56945873000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Regenerative Medicine"}, "7405436570": {"Name": "Lee B.", "AuthorID": "7405436570", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Instititue of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "14123974900": {"Name": "Sarkar S.", "AuthorID": "14123974900", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Instititue of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "56266492200": {"Name": "Linh N.", "AuthorID": "56266492200", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Instititue of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University"}, "56699169300": {"Name": "Jung H.", "AuthorID": "56699169300", "AffiliationID": "60025615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan Hospital"}}}
