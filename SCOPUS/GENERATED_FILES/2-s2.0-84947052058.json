Allocentric lock theory, emphasising the role of reference frame processing in body image, suggests that ED patients may be (b)locked to an (allocentric) representation of their own body stored in long-term memory (e.g., my body is fat) that is not updated (modified) by the (real-time egocentric) perception-driven experience of the physical body. Employing a well-validated virtual reality-based procedure, relative to healthy controls, ED patients showed deficits in the ability to refer to and update a long-term stored (allocentric) representation with (egocentric) perceptual-driven inputs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body image", "Eating disorders", "Spatial reference frame"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Body Image", "Computer Simulation", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Memory, Long-Term", "Photic Stimulation", "Space Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947052058", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"54910848200": {"Name": "Serino S.", "AuthorID": "54910848200", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Applied Technology for Neuro-Psychology Lab, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "36717478000": {"Name": "Cipresso P.", "AuthorID": "36717478000", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Applied Technology for Neuro-Psychology Lab, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "56962750600": {"Name": "Riva G.", "AuthorID": "56962750600", "AffiliationID": "60024053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart"}, "55366742000": {"Name": "Dakanalis A.", "AuthorID": "55366742000", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interdisciplinary Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interdisciplinary Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "36617443000": {"Name": "Gaudio S.", "AuthorID": "36617443000", "AffiliationID": "60005308", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrated Research-Area of Diagnostic Imaging, University Campus Bio-Medico"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College of London"}}}
