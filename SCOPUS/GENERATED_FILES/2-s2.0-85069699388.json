Published by Oxford University Press.We study a model that integrates productive and socialising efforts with occupational choice, and endogenous spillovers. We show that more talented individuals work harder and contribute more to externalities, but also have incentives to segregate. Average socialising increases the productivity of the occupation. The size of an occupation grows with its synergies. Individuals underinvest in productive and socialising effort, and sort themselves inefficiently into occupations. We derive the optimal subsidy for sorting into different occupations. Finally, we derive a rule to identify overpopulated sectors and establish the connection between inequality of talents, socialising, productive efforts and occupation size.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069699388", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6507259939": {"Name": "Albornoz F.", "AuthorID": "6507259939", "AffiliationID": "60004518", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Interdisciplinario de Econom\u00eda Pol\u00edtica, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (IIIEP-CONICET)"}, "6602192383": {"Name": "Cabrales A.", "AuthorID": "6602192383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "6603124912": {"Name": "Hauk E.", "AuthorID": "6603124912", "AffiliationID": "60105207", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Graduate School of Economics"}}}
