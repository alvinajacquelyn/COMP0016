We demonstrate here that arginase 2 (ARG2) drives neuroblastoma cell proliferation via regulation of arginine metabolism. Targeting arginine metabolism, either by blocking cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1)-dependent arginine uptake in vitro or therapeutic depletion of arginine by pegylated recombinant arginase BCT-100, significantly delayed tumor development and prolonged murine survival. Tumor cells polarized infiltrating monocytes to an M1-macrophage phenotype, which released IL1b and TNFa in a RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT)-dependent manner. IL1b and TNFa established a feedback loop to upregulate ARG2 expression via p38 and extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in neuroblastoma and neural crest-derived cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that enrichment of IL1b and TNFa in stage IV human tumor microenvironments was associated with a worse prognosis. These data thus describe an immune-metabolic regulatory loop between tumor cells and infiltrating myeloid cells regulating ARG2, which can be clinically exploited.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Arginase", "Arginine", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Interleukin-1beta", "Macrophages", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myeloid Cells", "Neuroblastoma", "Sarcoma, Ewing", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060936151", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57188812315": {"Name": "Fultang L.", "AuthorID": "57188812315", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "56957052100": {"Name": "Gneo L.", "AuthorID": "56957052100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "57205640017": {"Name": "De Bie F.", "AuthorID": "57205640017", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "34568290300": {"Name": "Booth S.", "AuthorID": "34568290300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "57188810900": {"Name": "Vardon A.", "AuthorID": "57188810900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "6603462392": {"Name": "De Santo C.", "AuthorID": "6603462392", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "25228086200": {"Name": "Mussai F.", "AuthorID": "25228086200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "36463272400": {"Name": "Gamble L.D.", "AuthorID": "36463272400", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60010162", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "57190608482": {"Name": "Eden G.L.", "AuthorID": "57190608482", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60010162", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "13310325900": {"Name": "Norris M.D.", "AuthorID": "13310325900", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60010162", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "16444949000": {"Name": "Murray J.", "AuthorID": "16444949000", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60010162", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "7202565091": {"Name": "Ziegler D.S.", "AuthorID": "7202565091", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60010162", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "57042367600": {"Name": "Haber M.", "AuthorID": "57042367600", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60010162", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "8599337900": {"Name": "Berry A.M.", "AuthorID": "8599337900", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "15823901800": {"Name": "Brownhill S.", "AuthorID": "15823901800", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "9839266200": {"Name": "Burchill S.A.", "AuthorID": "9839266200", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "56589607000": {"Name": "Egan S.A.", "AuthorID": "56589607000", "AffiliationID": "60024834, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, Sutton Bonington Campus, University of Nottingham"}, "15756699100": {"Name": "Yogev O.", "AuthorID": "15756699100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6603378797": {"Name": "Chesler L.", "AuthorID": "6603378797", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57213857529": {"Name": "McConville C.M.", "AuthorID": "57213857529", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57195770454": {"Name": "Cheng P.N.", "AuthorID": "57195770454", "AffiliationID": "60112954", "AffiliationName": "Bio-Cancer Treatment International"}, "6603363593": {"Name": "Etchevers H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603363593", "AffiliationID": "60107057, 60000905, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "GMGF, Aix Marseille University, INSERM"}, "57205473152": {"Name": "Schmidt R.", "AuthorID": "57205473152", "AffiliationID": "60116566", "AffiliationName": "Sciomics GmbH"}}}
