Herein, we present a straightforward, solution-based route for the preparation of tin monosulfide (SnS) films employing a green solvent, namely, tetrahydrofuran (THF). We show that the surface coverage and the morphology of the SnS films can be tuned by modification of the precursor solution composition and film deposition conditions. Furthermore, we explore the effect of a PEDOT:PSS interlayer and fabricate solar cells based on the following architecture: FTO/planar-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/SnS/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. Devices based on this architecture are shown to exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.0%, thus demonstrating the potential of our method for the development of low-cost and environmentally friendly solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hybrid solar cells", "mesoporous TiO2", "morphology", "solution processed deposition", "thin film solar cells", "tin monosulfide (SnS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hybrid solar cells", "Mesoporous TiO2", "Monosulfide", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Precursor solutions", "Solution processable", "Solution-processed", "Surface coverages"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063161218", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57196713873": {"Name": "Ding D.", "AuthorID": "57196713873", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "23994251000": {"Name": "Rath T.", "AuthorID": "23994251000", "AffiliationID": "60110570, 60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemistry and Technology of Materials, NAWI Graz, Graz University of Technology"}, "57060461100": {"Name": "Lanzetta L.", "AuthorID": "57060461100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "57208405172": {"Name": "Manuel Marin-Beloqui J.", "AuthorID": "57208405172", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "55382763400": {"Name": "Haque S.A.", "AuthorID": "55382763400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}}}
