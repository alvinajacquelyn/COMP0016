There is an urgent need for an effective and safe dengue vaccine to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population given the lack of dengue specific treatment at present. This review aims to determine the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of CYD-TDV vaccine in children. Methods: This is a systematic review including meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trial data from Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies that assessed CYD-TDV vaccine efficacy [(1 - RR)*100], safety (RR), and immunogenicity (weighted mean difference) in children were included in this study. Random effects model was employed to analyze patient-level data extracted from primary studies. Results: The overall efficacy of CYD-TDV vaccine was 54% (40-64), while serotype-specific efficacy was 77% (66-85) for DENV4, 75% (65-82) for DENV3, 50% (36-61) for DENV1, and 34% (14-49) for DENV2. 15% (-174-74) vaccine efficacy was obtained for the unknown serotype. Meta-analysis of included studies with longer follow-up time (25 months) revealed that CYD-TDV vaccine significantly increased the risk of injection site reactions (RR = 1.1: 1.04-1.17; p-value = 0.001). Immunogenicity (expressed as geometric mean titers) in descending order was 439.7 (331.7-547.7), 323 (247 - 398.7), 144.1 (117.9-170.2), and 105 (88.7-122.8) for DENV3, DENV2, DENV1, and DENV4, respectively. Conclusion: CYD-TDV vaccine is effective and immunogenic in children overall. Reduced efficacy of CYD-TDV vaccine against DENV2 notoriously known for causing severe dengue infection and dengue outbreaks cause for serious concern. Post hoc meta-analysis of long-term follow-up data (\u226525 months) from children previously vaccinated with CYD-TDV vaccine is needed to make a conclusion regarding CYD-TDV vaccine safety in children. However, CYD-TDV vaccine should be considered for use in regions where DENV2 is not endemic as currently there is no specific treatment for dengue infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CYD-TDV", "Dengue hemorrhagic fever", "Dengue shock syndrome", "Dengue virus", "Efficacy", "Immunogenicity", "Safety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026837318", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57195293069": {"Name": "Malisheni M.", "AuthorID": "57195293069", "AffiliationID": "60021981, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research"}, "56389552300": {"Name": "Takah N.", "AuthorID": "56389552300", "AffiliationID": "108182348", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health"}, "57195293466": {"Name": "Murewanhema G.", "AuthorID": "57195293466", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "College of Health Sciences, University of Zimbabwe"}, "6602265469": {"Name": "Khaiboullina S.F.", "AuthorID": "6602265469", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Kazan Federal University"}, "6507161167": {"Name": "Rizvanov A.A.", "AuthorID": "6507161167", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Kazan Federal University"}, "57211761052": {"Name": "Bates M.", "AuthorID": "57211761052", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "HerpeZ, University Teaching Hospital"}}}
