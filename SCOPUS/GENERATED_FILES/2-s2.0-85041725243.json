Cable et al.We examined correlating clinical biomarkers for the physical aspect of frailty among community-dwelling older adults in Japan, using Japanese Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES). We used information from the JAGES participants (N = 3,128) who also participated in the community health screening in 2010. We grouped participants' response to the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) Frailty Index into robust (=0), intermediate frail (=1), and frail (=2+) ones to indicate physical aspect of frailty. Independent of sex and age, results from multinomial logistic regression showed above normal albumin and below normal HDL and haemoglobin levels were positively associated with intermediate frail (RRR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.22-3.23; RRR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.33-1.39; RRR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.23-1.51, resp.) and frail cases (RRR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.91-2.70; RRR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.51-1.68; RRR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.28-1.52, resp.). Limited to women, above normal Hb1Ac level was similarly associated with intermediate frail and frail cases (RRR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.38; RRR = 2.56, 95% CI = 2.23-2.95, resp.). Use of relevant clinical biomarkers can help in assessment of older adults' physical aspect of frailty.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Fractures, Bone", "Frail Elderly", "Frailty", "Geriatric Assessment", "Hemoglobins", "Humans", "Japan", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Male", "Osteoporosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041725243", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"22633502300": {"Name": "Cable N.", "AuthorID": "22633502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "54684048800": {"Name": "Hiyoshi A.", "AuthorID": "54684048800", "AffiliationID": "60008141", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medical Sciences, \u00d6rebro University"}, "57194173847": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6qvist H.", "AuthorID": "57194173847", "AffiliationID": "60008141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, \u00d6rebro University, \u00d6rebro Oru.se"}, "36246380200": {"Name": "Kondo N.", "AuthorID": "36246380200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health and Social Behavior, School of Public Health, University of Tokyo"}, "22984268200": {"Name": "Aida J.", "AuthorID": "22984268200", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Division of International and Community Oral Health, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University"}, "16834880600": {"Name": "Kondo K.", "AuthorID": "16834880600", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Center for Preventive Medical Science, Chiba University"}}}
