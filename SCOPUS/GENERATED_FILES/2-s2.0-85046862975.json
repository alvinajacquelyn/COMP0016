We make consistent measurements of the lensing signal of both samples in both Fourier and configuration space. By interpreting the excess signal present in the DLA catalog with respect to the parent quasar catalog as caused by the large scale structure traced by DLAs, we are able to infer the bias of these objects: bDLA=2.6\u00b10.9. These results are consistent with previous measurements made in cross-correlation with the Lyman-\u03b1 forest, although the current noise in the lensing data and the low number density of DLAs limits the constraining power of this measurement. We discuss the robustness of the analysis with respect to a number different systematic effects and forecast prospects of carrying out this measurement with data from future experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gravitational lensing", "Lyman alpha forest", "redshift surveys"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046862975", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"55574123054": {"Name": "Alonso D.", "AuthorID": "55574123054", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Astrophysics"}, "57202033656": {"Name": "Colosimo J.", "AuthorID": "57202033656", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Georgia Tech"}, "6602975545": {"Name": "Slosar A.", "AuthorID": "6602975545", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "27267690300": {"Name": "Font-Ribera A.", "AuthorID": "27267690300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
