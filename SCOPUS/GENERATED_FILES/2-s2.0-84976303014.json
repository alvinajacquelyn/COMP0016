Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.With the rapid development of 3D Digital City, the focus of research has shifted from 3D city modeling and geo-database construction to 3D geo-database service and maintenance. The frequent modifications on geometry, texture, attribute, and topology present a great challenge to the 3D geo-database updating. This article proposes an event-driven spatiotemporal database model (ESDM) that combines the historical and present 3D city models with the semantic classification and state expression, triggered by changing events predefined. In addition, a corresponding dynamic updating method based on adaptive matching algorithm is presented to perform the dynamic updating operation for the complex 3D city models automatically, according to the compound matching of semantics, attributes, and spatial locations. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the proposed ESDM and its updating method are demonstrated through a 3D geo-database with more than 1.5 million 3D city models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D geo-database", "adaptive matching", "Dynamic updating", "event-driven", "semantic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976303014", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"]], "AuthorData": {"57221039072": {"Name": "Guo H.", "AuthorID": "57221039072", "AffiliationID": "60087824", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources"}, "56829171600": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56829171600", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56828395700": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "56828395700", "AffiliationID": "60087824", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55585973400": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "55585973400", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University"}, "34979551300": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "34979551300", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University"}}}
