Despite early specialist input, delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment initiation are common. Next-generation sequencing approaches still have limitations but are already enabling earlier and more efficient diagnoses in these patients. We designed a gene panel targeting 614 genes causing inborn errors of metabolism and tested its diagnostic efficacy in a paediatric cohort of 30 undiagnosed patients presenting with variable neurometabolic phenotypes. Genetic defects that could, at least partially, explain observed phenotypes were identified in 53% of cases. Where biochemical abnormalities pointing towards a particular gene defect were present, our panel identified diagnoses in 89% of patients. Phenotypes attributable to defects in more than one gene were seen in 13% of cases. The ability of in silico tools, including structure-guided prediction programmes to characterize novel missense variants were also interrogated. Our study expands the genetic, clinical and biochemical phenotypes of well-characterized (POMGNT1, TPP1) and recently identified disorders (PGAP2, ACSF3, SERAC1, AFG3L2, DPYS). Overall, our panel was accurate and efficient, demonstrating good potential for applying similar approaches to clinically and biochemically diverse neurometabolic disease cohorts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gene panel", "heterogeneity", "inborn errors of metabolism", "neurometabolic disorders", "next-generation sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Brain Diseases, Metabolic", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genotype", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Infant", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Phenotype", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994515811", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56898619300": {"Name": "Reid E.S.", "AuthorID": "56898619300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56183538300": {"Name": "Papandreou A.", "AuthorID": "56183538300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37662629100": {"Name": "Wedatilake Y.", "AuthorID": "37662629100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005299518": {"Name": "Grunewald S.", "AuthorID": "7005299518", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202063886": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "57202063886", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.T.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.B.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6602286208": {"Name": "Varadkar S.M.", "AuthorID": "6602286208", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23027459500": {"Name": "Drury S.", "AuthorID": "23027459500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "18433631700": {"Name": "Boustred C.", "AuthorID": "18433631700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603671274": {"Name": "Beesley C.", "AuthorID": "6603671274", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193306822": {"Name": "Lench N.", "AuthorID": "57193306822", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102549319": {"Name": "Yue W.W.", "AuthorID": "7102549319", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Oxford"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "9742603900": {"Name": "Anderson G.", "AuthorID": "9742603900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8598469800": {"Name": "Abulhoul L.", "AuthorID": "8598469800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35602576700": {"Name": "Broomfield A.", "AuthorID": "35602576700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202006123": {"Name": "Cleary M.", "AuthorID": "7202006123", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
