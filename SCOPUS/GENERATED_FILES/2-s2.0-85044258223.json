Design: Cohort study. Participants: People with COPD aged \u2265 40 years and who were current or ex-smokers were identified from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey. Outcome measures: Data were collected regarding demographics, anthropometric measurements, medical history, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, health outcomes, and mortality. Analysis: Participants were categorised into one of the following activity phenotypes: \u2018couch potatoes\u2019 were those who were insufficiently active with high leisure-based sitting time and/or no domestic physical activity; \u2018light movers\u2019 were insufficiently active with some domestic physical activity; 'sedentary exercisers\u2019 were sufficiently active with high leisure-based sitting time; and \u2018busy bees\u2019 were sufficiently active with low leisure-based sitting time. 'sufficiently active\u2019 was defined as adhering to physical activity (PA) recommendations of \u2265 7.5 metabolic equivalent (MET) hours/week. \u2018Low leisure-based sitting time\u2019 was defined as \u2264 200 minutes of recreational screen time/day. Results: The 584 participants had a mean age of 64 years (SD 12) and 52% were male. Over 5.5 years (SD 1.3) of follow-up, there were 81 all-cause deaths from 433 COPD participants with available data. Compared to the \u2018couch potatoes\u2019, there was a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in the \u2018busy bees\u2019 (Hazard Ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.65) with a trend towards a reduction in mortality risk in the other phenotypes. The odds of diabetes were lower in the \u2018busy bees\u2019 compared to the \u2018couch potatoes\u2019 (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.67). Conclusions: Adhering to physical activity guidelines and keeping leisure-based sitting time low had a mortality benefit and lowered the odds of diabetes in people with COPD.
