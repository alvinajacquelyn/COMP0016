The season also highlighted the unique vulnerabilities of populations residing on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to the catastrophic potential of these storms. During 2017, 22 of the 29 Caribbean SIDS were affected by at least one named storm, and multiple SIDS experienced extreme damage. This paper aims to review the multiplicity of storm impacts on Caribbean SIDS throughout the 2017 season, to explicate the influences of climate drivers on storm formation and intensity, to explore the propensity of SIDS to sustain severe damage and prolonged disruption of essential services, to document the spectrum of public health consequences, and to delineate the daunting hurdles that challenged emergency response and recovery operations for island-based, disaster-affected populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate change", "climate driver", "disaster", "disaster response", "hazard", "health consequences", "hurricane", "risk", "Small Island Developing States", "tropical cyclone", "tropical storm", "vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caribbean Region", "Climate Change", "Cyclonic Storms", "Disaster Planning", "Humans", "Risk Factors", "United Nations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045053935", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7005819250": {"Name": "Shultz J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005819250", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60015206", "AffiliationName": "Center for Disaster and Extreme Event Preparedness (DEEP Center), Department of Public Health Sciences (DPHS), University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"}, "6603705217": {"Name": "Kossin J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603705217", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), Center for Weather and Climate, University of Wisconsin"}, "7401742385": {"Name": "Shepherd J.M.", "AuthorID": "7401742385", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "UGA Athletic Association, Atmospheric Sciences Program, University of Georgia"}, "57201486062": {"Name": "Ransdell J.M.", "AuthorID": "57201486062", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60015206", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"}, "56865990500": {"Name": "Walshe R.", "AuthorID": "56865990500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60080184", "AffiliationName": "University of Agder"}, "7006024584": {"Name": "Galea S.", "AuthorID": "7006024584", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Boston University"}}}
