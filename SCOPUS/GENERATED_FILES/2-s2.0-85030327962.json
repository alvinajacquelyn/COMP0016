A probabilistic framework for semi-supervised adaptation of a generic patient-independent neonatal seizure detector is proposed. A system that is based on a combination of patient-adaptive (generative) and patient-independent (discriminative) classifiers is designed and evaluated on a large database of unedited continuous multichannel neonatal EEG recordings of over 800 h in duration. It is shown that an improvement in the detection of neonatal seizures over the course of long EEG recordings is achievable with on-the-fly incorporation of patient-specific EEG characteristics. In the clinical setting, the employment of the developed system will maintain a seizure detection rate at 70% while halving the number of false detections per hour, from 0.4 to 0.2 FD/h. This is the first study to propose the use of online adaptation without clinical labels, to build a personalized diagnostic system for the detection of neonatal seizures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["detection", "Neonatal", "online adaptation", "seizure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical settings", "Diagnostic systems", "Neonatal", "On-line adaptation", "Probabilistic framework", "Real-time diagnosis", "Seizure", "Seizure detection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030327962", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}, "36832339300": {"Name": "Marnane W.", "AuthorID": "36832339300", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}, "7003406304": {"Name": "Lightbody G.", "AuthorID": "7003406304", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}, "56982396500": {"Name": "Sarkar A.", "AuthorID": "56982396500", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, INFANT Center, University College Cork"}, "54906442400": {"Name": "Mathieson S.", "AuthorID": "54906442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Research Department of Neonatology, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
