The site is one of many on Belize's coast and cayes that exhibit anomalous vegetation and dark-coloured soils. These soils, although sought for cultivation, are not typical \u2018Amazonian Dark Earths\u2019 but instead are distinctive to the weathering of carbonate-rich anthropogenic deposits. We tentatively term these location-specific soils as Maya Dark Earths. Our research seeks to quantify the role of human activities in long-term environmental change and to develop strategies, specifically Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), that can be applied to environmental impact modelling today.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthrosols", "Archaeobotany", "Belize", "Maya", "Plant communities", "Soil micromorphology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951813052", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"23080016600": {"Name": "Graham E.", "AuthorID": "23080016600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7006109788": {"Name": "Macphail R.", "AuthorID": "7006109788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "24722840900": {"Name": "Arroyo-Kalin M.", "AuthorID": "24722840900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57021002400": {"Name": "Duncan L.", "AuthorID": "57021002400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "37068539600": {"Name": "Austin P.", "AuthorID": "37068539600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7402275188": {"Name": "Turner S.", "AuthorID": "7402275188", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57210680746": {"Name": "Crowther J.", "AuthorID": "57210680746", "AffiliationID": "60105000", "AffiliationName": "University of Wales Trinity Saint David"}, "7005025101": {"Name": "Stegemann J.", "AuthorID": "7005025101", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55886771000": {"Name": "Whittet R.", "AuthorID": "55886771000", "AffiliationID": "60021541", "AffiliationName": "Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh"}, "57021823800": {"Name": "Rosique C.", "AuthorID": "57021823800", "AffiliationID": "60021541", "AffiliationName": "Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh"}}}
