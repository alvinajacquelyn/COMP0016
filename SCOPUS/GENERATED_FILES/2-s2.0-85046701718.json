In this paper, we explore the design space around movement as a form of gestural communication for information output, in simple actuated desktop devices. We were curious as to how people might envision interacting with autonomous technology in the office. Accordingly, we focused our attentions on one prevalent desktop object, an interactive lamp, with three actuated joints, which allowed us to explore the interaction space of such devices. We invited 13 participants to design and enact movements with the lamp to communicate 20 simple messages. We explored a subset of these generated gestures, using the lamp as a personal cueing device in an office setting with 14 new participants. We present our qualitative findings from both studies that let users imagine the usage of an interactive desktop lamp through actuation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actuated Interfaces", "Autonomous Technology", "Interactive Desktop Lamp", "Qualitative Evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actuated interfaces", "Actuated joint", "Autonomous technology", "Design spaces", "Desktop devices", "Gestural communication", "Interactive desktops", "Qualitative evaluations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046701718", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"54795610200": {"Name": "Nowacka D.", "AuthorID": "54795610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36624607400": {"Name": "Wolf K.", "AuthorID": "36624607400", "AffiliationID": "60032697", "AffiliationName": "Hamburg University of Applied Sciences"}, "27169862100": {"Name": "Kirk D.", "AuthorID": "27169862100", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Northumbria University"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Northumbria University"}}}
