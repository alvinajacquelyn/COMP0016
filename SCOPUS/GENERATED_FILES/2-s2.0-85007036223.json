For the purpose of reducing scan times, two approaches are presented; the \"reverse projection\" acquisition scheme which allows a continuous rotation of the sample, and the \"single image\" retrieval algorithm, which requires only one frame for retrieval of the projected phase map. These are expected to lead to a substantial reduction of EI CT scan times, a prospect which is likely to promote the translation of EI into several applications, including clinical. The last development presented is the \"modified local\" phase retrieval. This retrieval algorithm is specifically designed to accurately retrieve sample properties (absorption, refraction, scattering) in cases where high-resolution scans are required in non-ideal environments. Experimental results, using both synchrotron radiation and laboratory sources, are shown for the various approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computed tomography", "edge illumination", "fast imaging", "phase retrieval", "Phase-contrast imaging", "X-ray imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fast imaging", "High resolution scans", "Phase contrast tomography", "Phase retrieval", "Phase-contrast imaging", "Substantial reduction", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging", "Xray imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007036223", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56954731500": {"Name": "Zamir A.", "AuthorID": "56954731500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.K.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.C.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.A.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35076756500": {"Name": "Urbani L.", "AuthorID": "35076756500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}}}
