The aim of this paper was to identify prognostic factors for cerebral palsy (CP) and motor impairment in children born VPT/VLBW. Method: A systematic review was conducted using Medline, Embase, and Pyscinfo databases to identify studies published between 1 January 1990 and 1 June 2014 reporting multivariable prediction models for poor neurodevelopment in VPT/VLBW children (registration number CRD42014006943). Twenty-eight studies for motor outcomes were identified. Results: There was strong evidence that intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia, and some evidence that the use of postnatal steroids and non-use of antenatal steroids, were prognostic factors for CP. Male sex and gestational age were of limited use as prognostic factors for CP in cohorts restricted to \u226432 weeks gestation; however, in children older than 5 years with no major disability, there was evidence that male sex was a predictive factor for motor impairment. Interpretation: This review has identified factors which may be of prognostic value for CP and motor impairment in VPT/VLBW children and will help to form the basis of future prognostic research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Palsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature, Diseases", "Infant, Very Low Birth Weight", "Male", "Movement Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968561626", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"8276805500": {"Name": "Linsell L.", "AuthorID": "8276805500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "6603291061": {"Name": "Malouf R.", "AuthorID": "6603291061", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "7004033234": {"Name": "Kurinczuk J.J.", "AuthorID": "7004033234", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "35477488500": {"Name": "Morris J.", "AuthorID": "35477488500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Environmental and Preventive Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Women's Health, University College London"}}}
