To reduce the burden of the disease, major efforts have focused on prevention through screening or improvements in treatment. Over the last 50 years, screening for cervical cancer has significantly reduced mortality in the developed world. This is not mirrored in low income countries where the majority of cases occur. There is therefore an immediate need to develop alternative screening strategies in low resource setting. Cytology and HPV testing are the main tests used in the developed world with visual inspection or cheaper HPV tests used in low resource settings. Whether screening impacts on ovarian cancer mortality is still unclear. The results from the large screening trials in the general population and women at high risk will be available in 2015. It is likely that the recent insights into ovarian cancer tumour biology and heterogeneity will impact on the screening tests/strategies used in the future to target those accounting for most of the mortality. Screening for endometrial cancer is only recommended in women at high risk as part of the Lynch Syndrome families. In the general population, screening is not recommended as majority of women present with symptoms and at early stage. However, in view of the anticipated increase in endometrial cancer related to the obesity epidemic and aging, the focus over the next 5 years will be on developing novel screening approaches/risk stratification tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Cervical", "Endometrial", "Gynecologic", "Ovarian", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947433229", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"16205135000": {"Name": "Gentry-Maharaj A.", "AuthorID": "16205135000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health"}, "7003994115": {"Name": "Kalsi J.", "AuthorID": "7003994115", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health"}}}
