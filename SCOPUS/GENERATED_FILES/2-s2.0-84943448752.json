In this study, we have established a clinical-grade protocol under good manufacturing practice conditions for purging CD62L + naive T cells from steady-state leukapheresis products using the CliniMACS system. The efficacy of immunomagnetic CD62L depletion was assessed by analysis of cell composition and functional immune responses. A median 2.9 log CD62L depletion was achieved with no evidence of CD62L shedding during the procedure and a mean T-cell yield of 47%. CD62L - cells comprised an equal mix of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, with elimination of B cells but maintenance of regulatory T cells and natural killer cell populations. CD62L-depleted T cells were predominantly CD45RA - and CD45RA + effector memory (>90%) and contained the bulk of pentamer-staining antivirus-specific T cells. Functional assessment of CD62L - cells revealed the maintenance of antiviral T-cell reactivity and a reduction in the alloreactive immune response compared with unmanipulated cells. Clinical-grade depletion of naive T cells using immunomagnetic CD62L beads from steady-state leukapheresis products is highly efficient and generates cells suitable for adoptive transfer in the context of clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adoptive Transfer", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Immunomagnetic Separation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943448752", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6603005910": {"Name": "Verfuerth S.", "AuthorID": "6603005910", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Institute of Cancer Studies, University College London Medical School"}, "56682617700": {"Name": "Sousa P.S.E.", "AuthorID": "56682617700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Institute of Cancer Studies, University College London Medical School"}, "6701831494": {"Name": "Chakraverty R.", "AuthorID": "6701831494", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Institute of Cancer Studies, University College London Medical School"}, "36090766500": {"Name": "Beloki L.", "AuthorID": "36090766500", "AffiliationID": "113220626", "AffiliationName": "Oncohematology Research Group, Navarrabiomed-Miguel Servet Foundation"}, "57206648414": {"Name": "Murray M.", "AuthorID": "57206648414", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue Therapeutics, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Medical School"}, "56682461500": {"Name": "Peters M.D.", "AuthorID": "56682461500", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue Therapeutics, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Medical School"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "34973630700": {"Name": "Samuel E.R.", "AuthorID": "34973630700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue Therapeutics, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Medical School"}, "7202865272": {"Name": "Mackinnon S.", "AuthorID": "7202865272", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
