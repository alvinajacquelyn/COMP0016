Key to its exploitation has been the development of photonic based sources and detectors. However there is a lack of room temperature operating devices for both sources and detectors. We propose the use of uni-travelling carrier photodetectors (UTC-PDs) as both source and detectors for the range up to 2 THz.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Photodetector", "Photonic", "Terahertz"], "IndexKeywords": ["New applications", "Operating devices", "Room temperature", "Tera Hertz", "THz detectors", "Uni-travelling carriers"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923786846", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "55312030000": {"Name": "Natrella M.", "AuthorID": "55312030000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "53866442400": {"Name": "Graham C.", "AuthorID": "53866442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
