We have developed Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT) as a flexible methodology for making low-cost polysaccharide/protein glycoconjugates recombinantly in Escherichia coli. We have used PGCT to make a recombinant PCV containing serotype 4 capsular polysaccharide linked to the Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins NanA, PiuA, and Sp0148. The introduction of the Campylobacter jejuni UDP-glucose 4-epimerase gene GalE (gne) into E. coli improved the yield of the resulting glycoprotein. PGCT glycoconjugate vaccination generated strong antibody responses in mice to both the capsule and the carrier protein antigens, with the PiuA/capsule glycoconjugate inducing similar anti-capsular antibody responses as the commercial PCV Prevnar-13. Antibody responses to PGCT glycoconjugates opsonised S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis expressing the serotype 4 capsule and promoted neutrophil phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae to a similar level as antisera generated by vaccination with Prevnar-13. Vaccination with the PGCT glycoconjugates protected mice against meningitis and septicaemia with the same efficacy as vaccination with Prevnar-13. In addition, vaccination with the protein antigen components from PGCT glycoconjugates alone provided partial protection against septicaemia and colonisation. These data demonstrate that a vaccine made by PGCT is as effective as Prevnar-13, identifies PiuA as a carrier protein for glycoconjugate vaccines, and demonstrates that linking capsular antigen to S. pneumoniae protein antigens has additional protective benefits that could provide a degree of serotype-independent immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055960613", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"45661890700": {"Name": "Reglinski M.", "AuthorID": "45661890700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56607184600": {"Name": "Ercoli G.", "AuthorID": "56607184600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, University College London"}, "55314220700": {"Name": "Plumptre C.", "AuthorID": "55314220700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, University College London"}, "35310928900": {"Name": "Kay E.", "AuthorID": "35310928900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7101805466": {"Name": "Wren B.", "AuthorID": "7101805466", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7101845851": {"Name": "Petersen F.", "AuthorID": "7101845851", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Biology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo"}, "7102813284": {"Name": "Paton J.", "AuthorID": "7102813284", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Biomedical Science, Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, The University of Adelaide"}}}
