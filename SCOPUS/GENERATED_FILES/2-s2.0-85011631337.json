Reasons for testing (360 tests) were: symptoms of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (fever, lymphadenopathy and raised inflammatory markers); monitoring in known HHV-8 pathology other than Kaposi sarcoma (KS); investigation of known/suspected KS, and other/no reason. Of patients with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), 14/16 (88%) had detectable plasma HHV-8, as did 27/45 (60%) with biopsy proven or clinically confirmed KS, and 6/19 (32%) with lymphoma. Neither of the two patients with MCD and no detectable HHV-8 had SIRS symptoms at the time of the test. There was wide variation between centres in the indications prompting HHV-8 testing, with a more conservative approach resulting in a higher proportion of positive results. Measuring plasma HHV-8 in the absence of SIRS symptoms, established HHV-8 disease monitoring, or confirmed/suspected KS is unlikely to yield detectable HHV-8 thus allowing potential cost savings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Castleman", "Human herpesvirus-8", "Kaposi sarcoma", "polymerase chain reaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Giant Lymph Node Hyperplasia", "Guideline Adherence", "Herpesvirus 8, Human", "Humans", "Medical Audit", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Viral", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011631337", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56287592500": {"Name": "Nugent D.B.", "AuthorID": "56287592500", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193196327": {"Name": "Chung E.", "AuthorID": "57193196327", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7201998521": {"Name": "Webster D.", "AuthorID": "7201998521", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55921888300": {"Name": "Mabayoje D.", "AuthorID": "55921888300", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35558192400": {"Name": "El Bouzidi K.", "AuthorID": "35558192400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57193203448": {"Name": "O\u2019Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "57193203448", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55319142500": {"Name": "Ainsworth J.", "AuthorID": "55319142500", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
