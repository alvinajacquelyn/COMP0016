In Experiment 1, participants were provided with conditional probability information and/or temporal information and asked to infer the causal structure of a 3-variable mechanical system that operated probabilistically. Participants of all ages preferentially relied on the temporal pattern of events in their inferences, even if this conflicted with statistical information. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants observed a series of interventions on the system, which in these experiments operated deterministically. In Experiment 2, participants found it easier to use temporal pattern information than statistical information provided as a result of interventions. In Experiment 3, in which no temporal pattern information was provided, children from 6-to 7-years-old, but not younger children, were able to use intervention information to make causal chain judgments, although they had difficulty when the structure was a common cause. The findings suggest that participants, and children in particular, may find it more difficult to use statistical information than temporal pattern information because of its demands on information processing resources. However, there may also be an inherent preference for temporal information.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causal bayes nets", "Causal learning", "Time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Association Learning", "Child", "Cognition", "Concept Formation", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925720301", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"7007009642": {"Name": "McCormack T.", "AuthorID": "7007009642", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Queen's University Belfast"}, "21734154000": {"Name": "Frosch C.", "AuthorID": "21734154000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Leicester"}, "57032513400": {"Name": "Patrick F.", "AuthorID": "57032513400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6507379819": {"Name": "Lagnado D.", "AuthorID": "6507379819", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
