Psychological distress (symptoms of anxiety and depression) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so it might also be associated, directly or indirectly, with liver disease. We investigated the relationship between psychological distress (measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire [GHQ]) and liver disease mortality. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of data from individual participants in 16 prospective studies of the general population in the United Kingdom, initiated from 1994 through 2008. Subjects were assigned to groups based on GHQ score: 0 (no distress), 1-3, 4-6, or 7-12. Results We analyzed data from 166,631 individuals (55% women; mean \u00b1 SD age, 46.6 \u00b1 18.4 years; range, 16-102 years). During a mean follow-up period of 9.5 years, 17,368 participants died (457 with liver disease). We found a significant increase in liver disease mortality with increase in GHQ score (Ptrend <.001). The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for the highest GHQ score category (ie, 7-12), compared with the 0 score category, was 3.48 (95% confidence interval: 2.68-4.52). After adjustment for health behaviors, socioeconomic status, body mass index, and diabetes, this hazard ratio decreased to 2.59 (95% confidence interval: 1.82-3.68). Conclusions Based on a meta-analysis, psychological distress is associated with liver disease mortality, although this finding requires additional analysis. Although one is not likely to cause the other, we provide additional evidence for the deleterious effects of psychological problems on physical health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cirrhosis", "GHQ-12", "Mental Health", "Steatosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cause of Death", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Liver Diseases", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Questionnaires", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928610351", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"36667256000": {"Name": "Russ T.C.", "AuthorID": "36667256000", "AffiliationID": "118774986", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Dementia Clinical Research Network, NHS"}, "7101906583": {"Name": "Starr J.M.", "AuthorID": "7101906583", "AffiliationID": "118774986", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Dementia Clinical Research Network, NHS"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College"}, "26650061900": {"Name": "Morling J.R.", "AuthorID": "26650061900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Exercise and Sport Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney"}}}
