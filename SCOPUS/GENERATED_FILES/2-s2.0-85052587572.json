Our institution introduced a mandatory shunt protocol with the aim of reducing infection rate. Methods: A retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients undergoing permanent shunt operations (primary insertion and revision) across two study periods: 3 years immediately prior (2009\u20132012) and 3 years immediately after (2012\u20132015) protocol introduction. Absolute and relative risk reductions (ARR/RRR) and Chi-square statistical analysis was used alongside logistic regression, where any single factor with p \u2264 0.20 included in the multivariate model, producing an odds ratio (OR). Results: Eight hundred nine operations in 504 children were identified (442 pre-protocol, 367 post). Overall infection rate decreased from 5.43% (24/442) pre-protocol to 3.27% (12/367) post-protocol (ARR = 2.16%, RRR = 39.8%, NNT = 46.3, p = 0.138), which did not reach statistical significance. For primary shunt insertions, infection rate reduced from 3.63 to 2.55% (ARR = 1.08%, RRR = 29.8%, NNT = 92.6, p = 0.565), whilst for revisions, it reduced from 6.83 to 3.81% (ARR = 3.02%, RRR 44.2%, NNT = 33.1, p = 0.156). Multivariate logistic regression showed that surgeon experience was a statistically significant predictor of infection, whilst responsible pathogens and latency were similar across the pre- and post-protocol groups. Conclusion: The protocol reduced overall infection rate in primary and revision shunt operations and we recommend paediatric units consider introducing a similar protocol for these procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hydrocephalus", "Intracranial infection", "Paediatrics", "Ventriculoperitoneal shunt"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infection Control", "Male", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052587572", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201551699": {"Name": "Omrani O.", "AuthorID": "57201551699", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57203657516": {"Name": "O\u2019Connor J.", "AuthorID": "57203657516", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "54398602100": {"Name": "James G.", "AuthorID": "54398602100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57209733070": {"Name": "Hartley J.", "AuthorID": "57209733070", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
