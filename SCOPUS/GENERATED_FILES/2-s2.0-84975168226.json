Bd was first detected in the UK in 2004, and has since been detected in multiple wild amphibian populations. Most amphibians imported into the UK for the pet trade from outside the European Union enter the country via Heathrow Animal Reception Centre (HARC), where Bd-positive animals have been previously detected. Data on the volume, diversity and origin of imported amphibians were collected for 59 consignments arriving at HARC between November 2009 and June 2012, along with a surveillance study to investigate the prevalence of Bd in these animals. Forty-three amphibian genera were recorded, originating from 12 countries. It was estimated that 5000\u20137000 amphibians are imported through HARC into the UK annually for the pet trade. Bd was detected in consignments from the USA and Tanzania, in six genera, resulting in an overall prevalence of 3.6%. This suggests that imported amphibians are a source of Bd within the international pet trade.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amphibians", "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis", "Pet trade"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amphibians", "Animals", "Chytridiomycota", "Mycoses", "Pets", "Prevalence", "Tanzania"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975168226", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"35742569600": {"Name": "Wombwell E.L.", "AuthorID": "35742569600", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Anthropology and Conservation, Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, University of Kent"}, "7005973727": {"Name": "Garner T.W.J.", "AuthorID": "7005973727", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6701682562": {"Name": "Rowcliffe J.M.", "AuthorID": "6701682562", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "55227062300": {"Name": "Griffiths R.A.", "AuthorID": "55227062300", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Anthropology and Conservation, Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, University of Kent"}, "12789149900": {"Name": "Quest R.", "AuthorID": "12789149900", "AffiliationID": "112838127", "AffiliationName": "Heathrow Animal Reception Centre, City of London Corporation, Animal Health and Welfare Services"}, "57189763079": {"Name": "Pritchard S.", "AuthorID": "57189763079", "AffiliationID": "112838127", "AffiliationName": "Heathrow Animal Reception Centre, City of London Corporation, Animal Health and Welfare Services"}}}
