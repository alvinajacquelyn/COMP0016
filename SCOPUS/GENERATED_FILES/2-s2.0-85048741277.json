These systems routinely face the challenges of limited bandwidth capacities and network server failures, which degrade caching performance. In this paper, we study the problem of optimally allocating content over a resilient caching network, in which each cache may fail under some situations. Given content request rates and multiple routing paths, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected caching gain, i.e., the reduction of latency due to intermediate caching. The offline version of this problem is NP-hard. We first propose a centralized, offline algorithm and show that a solution with (1-1/e) approximation ratio to the optimal can be constructed. We then propose a distributed ascent algorithm based on the concave relaxation of the expected gain. Informed by the results of our analysis, we finally propose a distributed resilient caching algorithm (DR-Cache) that is simple and adaptive to network failures. We show numerically that DR-Cache significantly outperforms other candidate algorithms under synthetic requests, as well as real world traces over a class of network topologies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Approximation ratios", "Caching algorithm", "Caching performance", "Concave relaxations", "Limited bandwidth", "Multiple routing paths", "Off-line algorithm", "Optimization problems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048741277", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57056536300": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57056536300", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}, "57212692328": {"Name": "Griffin D.", "AuthorID": "57212692328", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}, "15124049200": {"Name": "Rio M.", "AuthorID": "15124049200", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}, "57204569944": {"Name": "Khoa Phan T.", "AuthorID": "57204569944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36184239500": {"Name": "Tuncer D.", "AuthorID": "36184239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14041390300": {"Name": "Koong Chai W.", "AuthorID": "14041390300", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Bournemouth Univeristy"}}}
