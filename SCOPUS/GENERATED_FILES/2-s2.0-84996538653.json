This has obvious implications for the safety of patients, their communities and for NHS resources. The objective of this study was to explore why adults who have been in contact with TB do, and do not, attend their screening appointment, thereby allowing identification of interventions to reduce non-attendance. Methods A multi-method approach was taken using 15 questionnaires with adults who attended for screening, 15 telephone questionnaires with adults who did not attend and in-depth interviews with 8 TB nurses. Interviews were coded to trace emerging descriptive themes, then refined through an iterative process of interpretation and recoding. Results Findings from the questionnaires and interviews were categorized into three principle themes following analysis: awareness, hospital factors and leadership. These themes deconstruct the complex phenomena of patients' lack of attendance at this TB contact screening service. Conclusion Recommendations related to issues of leadership, outreach services, flexibility of clinic timing and awareness amongst both the local community and GPs were made.", "AuthorKeywords": ["communicable diseases", "public health", "quality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Contact Tracing", "Female", "Hospitals, Urban", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Program Evaluation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996538653", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"25641427200": {"Name": "Maclellan J.", "AuthorID": "25641427200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57192073918": {"Name": "Wallace K.", "AuthorID": "57192073918", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Section, Public Health England"}, "24177616700": {"Name": "Vacchelli E.", "AuthorID": "24177616700", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Social Policy Research Centre, Middlesex University"}, "57117312000": {"Name": "Roe J.", "AuthorID": "57117312000", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "TB Services, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "7401730543": {"Name": "Davidson R.", "AuthorID": "7401730543", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "TB Services, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "35546455500": {"Name": "Southern J.", "AuthorID": "35546455500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Section, Public Health England"}}}
