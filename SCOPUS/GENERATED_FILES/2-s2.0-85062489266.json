Design: This is a retrospective, real-life, cohort study. Participants and Methods: In all, 92 diabetic patients (102 eyes) receiving intravitreal anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor therapy were included. A total of 99 aflibercept-treated eyes were included in the statistical analysis. Each patient had corrected visual acuity in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters and optical coherence tomography central foveal thickness and macular volume performed at baseline and 12 months. Patients were initiated on a loading phase of five monthly intravitreal aflibercept injections, followed by injections if needed as per clinicians\u2019 discretion. Results: The mean number of aflibercept injections received was 6.92. At baseline, the mean visual acuity (standard deviation; Snellen) was 59.7 (16.1) (20/63) Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, the mean central foveal thickness (standard deviation) was 431 (129) \u00b5m, while the mean macular volume (standard deviation) was 9.53 (1.79) mm3. At 12 months, the mean visual acuity (standard deviation; Snellen) was 69.6 (15.2; 20/40) Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (p <.0001). Mean central foveal thickness (standard deviation) was 306 (122) \u03bcm (p <.0001) and mean macular volume (standard deviation) was 8.43 (1.58) mm3 (p <.0001) at 12 months; 33 (33.67%) eyes gained \u2a7e15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters at month 12, and 50 (55.55%) eyes had a decrease in central foveal thickness of \u2a7e100 \u00b5m. Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in visual acuity and in anatomical outcomes in aflibercept-treated eyes at 12 months after commencing treatment for diabetic macular oedema in real-life settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aflibercept", "anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor", "diabetic macular oedema", "optical coherence tomography", "real-life setting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Cohort Studies", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Female", "Humans", "Intravitreal Injections", "Macular Edema", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Retreatment", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062489266", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57209482577": {"Name": "Lukic M.", "AuthorID": "57209482577", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57199257787": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "57199257787", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "24833529000": {"Name": "Shalchi Z.", "AuthorID": "24833529000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7401717575": {"Name": "Patel P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401717575", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003429874": {"Name": "Hykin P.G.", "AuthorID": "7003429874", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57191501164": {"Name": "Menon D.", "AuthorID": "57191501164", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57199651888": {"Name": "Bruynseels A.", "AuthorID": "57199651888", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35795310300": {"Name": "Hamilton R.D.", "AuthorID": "35795310300", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
