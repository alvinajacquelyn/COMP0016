This chapter aims to summarize the current knowledge on the clinical differential diagnoses of sporadic Parkinson's disease. As the number of monogenic familial Parkinson's disease variants and risk factors is growing, so is the number of appreciated etiologies of atypical parkinsonian and other pallidopyramidal syndromes. This work aims at summarizing the current knowledge on both motor and nonmotor neurological signs and symptoms that aid the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and its differential diagnoses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atypical parkinsonism", "Familial genetic Parkinson's disease", "Levodopa response", "Phenotypical characterization", "Secondary parkinsonism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016182758", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"53867273100": {"Name": "Schreglmann S.", "AuthorID": "53867273100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Philipps University"}}}
