Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are used to multiplex and demultiplex three linearly polarized (LP) modes (LP01, LP11a and LP11b) in two polarizations. A 6\u00d76 sparse frequency domain equalizer (FDE) is used as the channel impulse response of the SLM-based MDM system is found to be sparse due to the large crosstalk at the mode MUX/DEMUX and small coupling in the fiber. The signal transmitted on each mode is recovered with improved performance over conventional FDEs. The results indicate that this system can be used in short reach transmission applications to increase the system capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mode division multiplexing", "sparse equalizer", "Spatial light modulator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel impulse response", "Frequency domain equalizer (FDE)", "Graded-index multimode fiber", "Linearly polarized", "Mode-division multiplexing", "MUX/DEMUX", "Spatial light modulators", "System Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964836978", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55082608300": {"Name": "Feng F.", "AuthorID": "55082608300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Department, University of Cambridge"}, "48761195500": {"Name": "Gordon G.", "AuthorID": "48761195500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Department, University of Cambridge"}, "57203052649": {"Name": "Wilkinson T.", "AuthorID": "57203052649", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Department, University of Cambridge"}}}
