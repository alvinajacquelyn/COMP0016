Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels to EBV have been shown to be heritable and associated with developing malignancies. We, therefore, performed a pilot genome-wide association analysis of anti-EBV IgG traits in an African population, using a combined approach including array genotyping, whole-genome sequencing and imputation to a panel with African sequence data. In 1562 Ugandans, we identify a variant in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQA1, rs9272371 (p = 2.6 \u00d7 10-17) associated with anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 responses. Trans-ancestry meta-analysis and fine-mapping with European-ancestry individuals suggest the presence of distinct HLA class II variants driving associations in Uganda. In addition, we identify four putative, novel, very rare African-specific loci with preliminary evidence for association with anti-viral capsid antigen IgG responses which will require replication for validation. These findings reinforce the need for the expansion of such studies in African populations with relevant datasets to capture genetic diversity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Epstein-Barr virus", "genomics", "immunity", "infectious disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064095272", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55515253100": {"Name": "Sallah N.", "AuthorID": "55515253100", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virus Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "56464003200": {"Name": "Carstensen T.", "AuthorID": "56464003200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "56463621700": {"Name": "Pollard M.O.", "AuthorID": "56463621700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "24401522500": {"Name": "Gurdasani D.", "AuthorID": "24401522500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "25930326000": {"Name": "Ekoru K.", "AuthorID": "25930326000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "10039099800": {"Name": "Pomilla C.", "AuthorID": "10039099800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57204936727": {"Name": "Young E.H.", "AuthorID": "57204936727", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "23666866400": {"Name": "Fatumo S.", "AuthorID": "23666866400", "AffiliationID": "105140498", "AffiliationName": "H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) Node, National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), Federal Ministry of Science and Technology (FMST)"}, "7004012378": {"Name": "Sandhu M.", "AuthorID": "7004012378", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57216110322": {"Name": "Barroso I.", "AuthorID": "57216110322", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "56839023100": {"Name": "Kellam P.", "AuthorID": "56839023100", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virus Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "35727959100": {"Name": "Wakeham K.", "AuthorID": "35727959100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "12752430200": {"Name": "Asiki G.", "AuthorID": "12752430200", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "MRC/Uganda Virus Research Institute, Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "57206476386": {"Name": "Kamali A.", "AuthorID": "57206476386", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "MRC/Uganda Virus Research Institute, Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "55658055860": {"Name": "Newton R.", "AuthorID": "55658055860", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "MRC/Uganda Virus Research Institute, Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "6506837994": {"Name": "Bagni R.", "AuthorID": "6506837994", "AffiliationID": "60109509", "AffiliationName": "Protein Expression Lab, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, MD"}, "57220227292": {"Name": "Labo N.", "AuthorID": "57220227292", "AffiliationID": "60109509", "AffiliationName": "Viral Oncology Section, Aids and Cancer Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, MD"}, "7006776281": {"Name": "Whitby D.", "AuthorID": "7006776281", "AffiliationID": "60109509", "AffiliationName": "Viral Oncology Section, Aids and Cancer Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, MD"}}}
