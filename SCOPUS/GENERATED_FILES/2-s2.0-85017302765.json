Motivated by conventional recursive convolution (RC) methods in handling convolution integral, the method name quadratic RC (QRC) makes improvement in the approximation of electric field in convolution integral. The electric field is approximated by quadratic function determined by the fields at three time steps at current, next and former. Via quadratic interpolation, the convolution integral result is approximated by the linear combination of three electric fields, rather than two fields in trapezoidal RC (TRC) or piecewise linear RC (PLRC) and one field in constant RC (CRC). Because three electric fields are required for the convolution integral, the method needs two more back level storage of the electric fields to fulfill the recursion process. Numerical demonstrations of Debye and Drude slab's transmission and reflection coefficients demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the novel method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)", "Quadratic interpolation", "Quadratic recursive convolution (QRC)", "Recursive convolution (RC)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Convolution integrals", "Finite -difference time domains (FDTD)", "Linear combinations", "Quadratic function", "Quadratic interpolation", "Recursive convolution", "Recursive convolution methods", "Transmission and reflection coefficient"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017302765", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"26650422000": {"Name": "Ji J.", "AuthorID": "26650422000", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "School of Aeronautic Science and Engineering, Beihang University"}, "8388487200": {"Name": "Huang P.", "AuthorID": "8388487200", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "School of Aeronautic Science and Engineering, Beihang University"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193879156": {"Name": "Xue H.", "AuthorID": "57193879156", "AffiliationID": "106961925", "AffiliationName": "Beijing System Engineering Institute"}}}
