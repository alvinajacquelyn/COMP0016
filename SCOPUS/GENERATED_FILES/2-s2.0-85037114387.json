Objective: To estimate brain volume (BV) at 15 years after a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and to evaluate its relationship with disease outcomes. Methods: From a prospective cohort including patients presenting with a CIS, 54 patients with a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 15 years after CIS were included. Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), grey matter fraction (GMF) and white matter fraction (WMF) at 15-year follow-up were obtained. Regression analyses were conducted to predict BV loss and reaching an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 3.0 in that 15-year period. Results: In multivariable analyses, lower values of BPF and WMF were significantly associated with being male, presenting 3\u20134 Barkhof criteria at baseline, presenting a second relapse, and with a decision to start treatment. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only lower GMF was associated with a greater risk of reaching EDSS 3.0 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.24, p = 0.028). Conclusion: Lower BPF and WMF 15 years after CIS are associated with previous markers of inflammatory disease. Lower GMF 15 years after a CIS is associated with an increased risk of reaching an EDSS of 3.0.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrophy", "clinically isolated syndrome", "grey matter", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037114387", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"39763021100": {"Name": "Vidal-Jordana A.", "AuthorID": "39763021100", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Edifici Cemcat, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "6603920140": {"Name": "Sastre-Garriga J.", "AuthorID": "6603920140", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Edifici Cemcat, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "24463840100": {"Name": "Tur C.", "AuthorID": "24463840100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square MS Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "31967537700": {"Name": "Arrambide G.", "AuthorID": "31967537700", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Edifici Cemcat, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "24376504700": {"Name": "Otero-Romero S.", "AuthorID": "24376504700", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Edifici Cemcat, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "35416724300": {"Name": "Tintor\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "35416724300", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Edifici Cemcat, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "7007177960": {"Name": "Montalban X.", "AuthorID": "7007177960", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Edifici Cemcat, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "6603301072": {"Name": "Pareto D.", "AuthorID": "6603301072", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroradiology and Magnetic Resonance Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "17135372500": {"Name": "Huerga E.", "AuthorID": "17135372500", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroradiology and Magnetic Resonance Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "36343853200": {"Name": "Mitjana R.", "AuthorID": "36343853200", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroradiology and Magnetic Resonance Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "37025416000": {"Name": "Auger C.", "AuthorID": "37025416000", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroradiology and Magnetic Resonance Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "7102462625": {"Name": "Rovira A.", "AuthorID": "7102462625", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroradiology and Magnetic Resonance Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}}}
