It is suggested that it may be educationally and philosophically valuable to reflect on the ethically troubling choices that individuals in extreme situations make in their fight against oppression, and to ask questions about the risks and the costs involved when people, through a process of critical consciousness, become fully free to claim their moral and political agency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical pedagogy", "Hope", "Indignation", "Moral agency", "Oppression", "Violence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044076822", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57203671809": {"Name": "Suissa J.", "AuthorID": "57203671809", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
