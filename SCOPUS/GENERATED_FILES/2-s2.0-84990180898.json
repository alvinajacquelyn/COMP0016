However, biological adaptation solutions are complex, multi-functional and highly responsive. This paper proposes a biomimetic research of the relationship that can be developed between Biology and Architecture in order to propose innovative fa\u00e7ade design solutions. We focus on plants, because of plants, like buildings, lack of movement and remain subject to a specific location. Nevertheless, plants have adapted to the environment developing special means of interaction with changing external issues. This paper provides a methodology to create a data collection of plant adaptations and a design mapping to guide the transfer from biological principles to architectural resources, as well as two design concept cases, opening new perspectives for new possible technical solutions and showing the potential of plant adaptations to environmental conditions at a specific climate. Further step is the transformation of some design concepts into technical solutions through experiments with new technologies that include multi-material 3D printing or advances in material science.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive architectural envelopes", "Biomimicry", "Climate adaptations", "Energy efficiency", "Plant adaptations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive architectural envelopes", "Biological adaptation", "Biological principles", "Biomimetic principles", "Biomimicry", "Climate adaptations", "Environmental conditions", "Plant adaptation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990180898", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"57191444198": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez M.", "AuthorID": "57191444198", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Construction and Manufacturing Engineering.
