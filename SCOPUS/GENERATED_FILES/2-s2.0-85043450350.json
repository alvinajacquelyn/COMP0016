Published by IOP Publishing Ltd on behalf of Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.In recent years, quantum phenomena have been experimentally demonstrated on variety of optomechanical systems ranging from micro-oscillators to photonic crystals. Since single photon couplings are quite small, most experimental approaches rely on the realization of high finesse Fabry-Perot cavities in order to enhance the effective coupling. Here we show that by exploiting a, long path, low finesse fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer ground state cooling can be achieved. We model a 100 m long cavity with a finesse of 10 and analyze the impact of additional noise sources arising from the fiber. As a mechanical oscillator we consider a levitated microdisk but the same approach could be applied to other optomechanical systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fiber interferometer", "levitated optomechanics", "optical cooling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Effective coupling", "Experimental approaches", "Fiber fabry-perot interferometers", "Fiber interferometers", "Ground state cooling", "Mechanical oscillators", "Optical cooling", "Opto-mechanical systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043450350", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"23989469900": {"Name": "Pontin A.", "AuthorID": "23989469900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University College London"}, "57201121350": {"Name": "Mourounas L.", "AuthorID": "57201121350", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University College London"}, "7005032718": {"Name": "Geraci A.", "AuthorID": "7005032718", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University of Nevada"}}}
