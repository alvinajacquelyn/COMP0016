Distribution or reproduction of this work in whole or in part requires full attribution of the original publication, including its DOI.Forward and adjoint Monte Carlo (MC) models of radiance are proposed for use in model-based quantitative photoacoustic tomography. A two-dimensional (2-D) radiance MC model using a harmonic angular basis is introduced and validated against analytic solutions for the radiance in heterogeneous media. A gradientbased optimization scheme is then used to recover 2-D absorption and scattering coefficients distributions from simulated photoacoustic measurements. It is shown that the functional gradients, which are a challenge to compute efficiently using MC models, can be calculated directly from the coefficients of the harmonic angular basis used in the forward and adjoint models. This work establishes a framework for transport-based quantitative photoacoustic tomography that can fully exploit emerging highly parallel computing architectures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["inverse problem", "Monte Carlo", "photoacoustic tomography", "quantitative"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption and scatterings", "Functional gradient", "Gradient-based optimization", "Heterogeneous media", "Photoacoustic measurements", "Photoacoustic tomography", "quantitative", "Two Dimensional (2 D)", "Algorithms", "Light", "Monte Carlo Method", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Scattering, Radiation", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000766320", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56198068400": {"Name": "Hochuli R.", "AuthorID": "56198068400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}}}
