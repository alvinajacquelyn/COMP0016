Here, we present a stochastic-mechanical multiscale model of an endothelial cell monolayer and show that the dynamic nature of the endothelium leads to spontaneous gap formation, even without intervention from the transmigrating cells. These gaps preferentially appear at the vertices between three endothelial cells, as opposed to the border between two cells. We quantify the frequency and lifetime of these gaps, and validate our predictions experimentally. Interestingly, we find experimentally that cancer cells also preferentially extrava-sate at vertices, even when they first arrest on borders. This suggests that extravasating cells, rather than initially signaling to the endothelium, might exploit the autonomously forming gaps in the endothelium to initiate transmigration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Movement", "Endothelial Cells", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Gap Junctions", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065595666", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"56810719400": {"Name": "Escribano J.", "AuthorID": "56810719400", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "8610266800": {"Name": "Garcia-Aznar J.", "AuthorID": "8610266800", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Zaragoza"}, "55882126000": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "55882126000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "26643635500": {"Name": "Kamm R.", "AuthorID": "26643635500", "AffiliationID": "60122463", "AffiliationName": "BioSystems and Micromechanics (BioSyM), Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"}, "56967373700": {"Name": "Cao X.", "AuthorID": "56967373700", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania"}, "35515368900": {"Name": "Shenoy V.", "AuthorID": "35515368900", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania"}, "14819916600": {"Name": "Spill F.", "AuthorID": "14819916600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Birmingham"}}}
