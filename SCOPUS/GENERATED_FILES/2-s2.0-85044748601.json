We compare the diagnosis, management and outcomes of VVF repair in resource-poor countries to current practice in the well-resourced setting, finally looking ahead to the future and the changes we need to make on a global scale in order to prevent this debilitating condition. There is a clear need for more accurate data collection and classification systems appropriate to the setting. Lack of facilities such as radiology limit diagnostic capabilities and options for repair, however outcome data from resource poor countries is promising. Most importantly, a holistic approach, which examines not just the physical aspects of the condition but the social and cultural factors predisposing women to VVF, needs to be adopted when considering prevention and management of this injury.
