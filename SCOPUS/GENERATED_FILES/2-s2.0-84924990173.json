We assessed the prevalence of anaemia and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Prospective data (anaemia [haemoglobin <12 g/dL], haematinics and length of hospital stay) was analysed on 400 hundred patients undergoing elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Results from a prospective database of 1530 patients undergoing elective general surgery were used as a baseline. Fifty-seven patients (14%) were anaemic pre-operatively, of which 98% were females. Median MCV (fL) and overall median ferritin (\u03bcg/L) was lower in anaemic patients (83 vs. 86, p = 0.001) and (28 vs. 61, p < 0.0001) respectively. In the elective general surgery patients, prevalence of anaemia was similar (14% vs. 16%) but absolute iron deficiency was more common in those undergoing bariatric surgery; microcytosis p < 0.0001, ferritin <30 p < 0.0001. Mean length of stay (days) was increased in the anaemic compared to in the non-anaemic group (2.7 vs. 1.9) and patients who were anaemic immediately post-operatively, also had an increased length of stay (2.7 vs. 1.9), p < 0.05. Absolute iron deficiency was more common in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. In bariatric patients with anaemia there was an overall increased length of hospital stay.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaemia", "Bariatric surgery", "Iron deficiency", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anemia, Iron-Deficiency", "Bariatric Surgery", "Erythrocyte Count", "Female", "Ferritins", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Morbid", "Postoperative Complications", "Preoperative Care", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924990173", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55303540100": {"Name": "Khanbhai M.", "AuthorID": "55303540100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56427569500": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "56427569500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "37025811900": {"Name": "Dubb S.", "AuthorID": "37025811900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "55199123000": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "55199123000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "7403429436": {"Name": "Ahmed A.", "AuthorID": "7403429436", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}}}
