While there is some evidence for norm-based coding when learning to discriminate different voices, little is known about how the representation of an individual's voice identity is formed through variable exposure to that voice. In two experiments, we show evidence that participants form abstracted representations of individual voice identities based on averages, despite having never been exposed to these averages during learning. We created 3 perceptually distinct voice identities, fully controlling their within-person variability. Listeners first learned to recognise these identities based on ring-shaped distributions located around the perimeter of within-person voice spaces \u2013 crucially, these distributions were missing their centres. At test, listeners\u2019 accuracy for old/new judgements was higher for stimuli located on an untrained distribution nested around the centre of each ring-shaped distribution compared to stimuli on the trained ring-shaped distribution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Pattern Recognition, Physiological", "Speech Perception", "Voice", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066615897", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56366640300": {"Name": "Lavan N.", "AuthorID": "56366640300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "56927661500": {"Name": "Knight S.", "AuthorID": "56927661500", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "8358934300": {"Name": "McGettigan C.", "AuthorID": "8358934300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}}}
