We aim to characterize the conflicting motivations of each stakeholder involved in the creation and formulation of such engagement and to capture the process of interaction\u2014from its initiation through the decision to continue, expand, or abolish these relations. Research Design: We employ a case study approach based on in-depth interviews with school principals, the NGO\u2019s CEO, representatives of the local education authority and Ministry of Education, and the Israeli parliament\u2019s Education Committee director, in addition to publication analysis, to provide a comprehensive view of the interaction from the stakeholders\u2019 perspectives. Findings: We find that school-NGO interaction results from multidimensional relations, wherein each involved entity holds a set of aims and motivations that intermingle with those of other entities to create and form the engagement. School-NGO interaction can be considered a form of entrepreneurship within the education system, with each stakeholder acting entrepreneurially to gain value, attain resources, and mitigate risks in a proactive and innovative matter. All stakeholders employ this initiative to address their own, sometimes conflicting, goals and to benefit according to their own agendas. Conclusions: We conclude by discussing possible theoretical and practical implications involving school principals\u2019 agency and NGO-school engagements in the local and global context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomy", "entrepreneurship", "power relations", "school principals", "school\u2013nongovernmental organization interaction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940047614", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Tel Aviv University"}, "56741484400": {"Name": "Sagie N.", "AuthorID": "56741484400", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Tel Aviv University"}}}
