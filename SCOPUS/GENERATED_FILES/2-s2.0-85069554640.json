Here, we developed a simple synthesis method to produce efficient, high-surface-area zinc oxide (ZnO) photocatalytic films using aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition. This approach used mixtures of methanol and acetic acid to promote preferential growth and exposure of polar facets, which favor photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, the initial enhanced efficiency of the films was correlated to structural defects, likely oxygen vacancies, as supported by photoluminescence spectroscopy results. Discussion over the influence of such defects on photocatalytic performance is described, and the need for strategies to develop high-surface-area materials containing stable defects is highlighted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AACVD", "oxygen vacancies", "photocatalyst", "polar facets", "ZnO"], "IndexKeywords": ["AACVD", "Aerosol-assisted chemical vapor depositions", "Antimicrobial coatings", "Photocatalytic film", "Photocatalytic performance", "Photocatalytic thin films", "polar facets", "Preferential growth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069554640", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"54584049700": {"Name": "Promdet P.", "AuthorID": "54584049700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16744209400": {"Name": "Quesada-Cabrera R.", "AuthorID": "16744209400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57205155714": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57205155714", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56155788500": {"Name": "Jiamprasertboon A.", "AuthorID": "56155788500", "AffiliationID": "60026326", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology"}, "56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57201695936": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57201695936", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
