However, there is limited physiological evidence of these neural gain changes in the auditory cortex of human adults. The present study investigated the impact of chronic, unilateral conductive hearing impairment on cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) recorded from 15 adults (21\u201365 years old) in response to a 1 kHz tone (80 ms duration) presented to the impaired ear via a bone conduction transducer. The amplitude and latency of the main CAEP components were compared to those obtained from normal hearing age-matched control participants. Both P1-N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes were significantly larger in the hearing impaired relative to the control participants. Differences between groups in the mean latencies of P1, N1, and P2 were not statistically significant. These results are the first to provide direct evidence of increased neural response amplitude in the adult human auditory cortex in the presence of unilateral conductive hearing loss. Importantly, the study shows that central gain changes are a direct result of deprivation of sound rather than cochlear or neural pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult", "Auditory deprivation", "Cortical auditory evoked potential", "Plasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Audiometry, Pure-Tone", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Threshold", "Bone Conduction", "Case-Control Studies", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Hearing Loss, Conductive", "Hearing Loss, Unilateral", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042178643", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57200687262": {"Name": "Parry L.V.", "AuthorID": "57200687262", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55340799100": {"Name": "Maslin M.R.D.", "AuthorID": "55340799100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "35580993300": {"Name": "Moore D.R.", "AuthorID": "35580993300", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "56066373500": {"Name": "Munro K.J.", "AuthorID": "56066373500", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "14014026800": {"Name": "Schaette R.", "AuthorID": "14014026800", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
