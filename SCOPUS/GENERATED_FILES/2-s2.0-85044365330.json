The primary sources of surveillance data on SDU should include both sexual health and drug treatment services. The challenges to achieving comprehensive, timely and valid SDU surveillance include establishing case definitions, selecting appropriate surveillance settings, and normalising the monitoring of SDU at clinical services. In this commentary we propose a means to address these challenges and discuss other sources of SDU data from ad hoc population surveys and sentinel systems. We also present case studies of SDU surveillance development in England and Switzerland. The patterns of SDU will be affected by a rapidly changing drug market and, as a result, surveillance systems must continuously adapt to ensure that they are fit for purpose and can provide data to guide policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gay men", "New psychoactive substances", "Sexualised drug use", "Surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["England", "Humans", "Prevalence", "Product Surveillance, Postmarketing", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Street Drugs", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Switzerland", "Unsafe Sex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044365330", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"22634041900": {"Name": "Giraudon I.", "AuthorID": "22634041900", "AffiliationID": "60050974", "AffiliationName": "Trends and Analysis Sector, Public Health Unit, European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)"}, "30567653800": {"Name": "Schmidt A.J.", "AuthorID": "30567653800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Sigma Research, Department of Public health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57197789900": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "57197789900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and STIs, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}}}
