About 2 million cervical cerclages are performed annually to prevent preterm birth. The procedure is thought to provide structural support and maintain the endocervical mucus plug as a barrier to ascending infection. Two types of suture material are used for cerclage: monofilament or multifilament braided. Braided sutures are most frequently used, although no evidence exists to favor them over monofilament sutures. We assessed birth outcomes in a retrospective cohort of 678 women receiving cervical cerclage in five UK university hospitals and showed that braided cerclage was associated with increased intrauterine death (15% versus 5%; P = 0.0001) and preterm birth (28% versus 17%; P = 0.0006) compared to monofilament suture. To understand the potential underlying mechanism, we performed a prospective, longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiome in women at risk of preterm birth because of short cervical length (\u226525 mm) who received braided (n = 25) or monofilament (n = 24) cerclage under comparable circumstances. Braided suture induced a persistent shift toward vaginal microbiome dysbiosis characterized by reduced Lactobacillus spp. and enrichment of pathobionts. Vaginal dysbiosis was associated with inflammatory cytokine and interstitial collagenase excretion into cervicovaginal fluid and premature cervical remodeling. Monofilament suture had comparatively minimal impact upon the vaginal microbiome and its interactions with the host. These data provide in vivo evidence that a dynamic shift of the human vaginal microbiome toward dysbiosis correlates with preterm birth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerclage, Cervical", "Cytokines", "Dysbiosis", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Premature Birth", "Retrospective Studies", "Vagina"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982065471", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55029191300": {"Name": "Kindinger L.M.", "AuthorID": "55029191300", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "St. Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "11739957000": {"Name": "MacIntyre D.A.", "AuthorID": "11739957000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Division of the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}, "15034496500": {"Name": "Lee Y.S.", "AuthorID": "15034496500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Division of the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}, "6507718752": {"Name": "Terzidou V.", "AuthorID": "6507718752", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60002484", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57190657931": {"Name": "Cook J.R.", "AuthorID": "57190657931", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Division of the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}, "16740657000": {"Name": "Lees C.", "AuthorID": "16740657000", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"}, "42060955100": {"Name": "Cacciatore S.", "AuthorID": "42060955100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Parturition Research Group, Division of the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}, "7402760935": {"Name": "Bennett P.R.", "AuthorID": "7402760935", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60018662", "AffiliationName": "Queen Charlotte's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) Trust"}, "35511924900": {"Name": "Teoh T.G.", "AuthorID": "35511924900", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "St. Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6603756922": {"Name": "Marchesi J.R.", "AuthorID": "6603756922", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "36917743400": {"Name": "McDonald J.A.K.", "AuthorID": "36917743400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive and Gut Health, Imperial College London"}, "7201667063": {"Name": "Holmes E.", "AuthorID": "7201667063", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Computational Systems Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "36037157800": {"Name": "Nicholson J.K.", "AuthorID": "36037157800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Computational Systems Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "55619313703": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "55619313703", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55660600800": {"Name": "Israfil-Bayli F.", "AuthorID": "55660600800", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Women's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701807808": {"Name": "Toozs-Hobson P.", "AuthorID": "6701807808", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Women's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190737951": {"Name": "Faiza Y.", "AuthorID": "57190737951", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Urogynaecology Department, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56238120500": {"Name": "Slack M.", "AuthorID": "56238120500", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Urogynaecology Department, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
