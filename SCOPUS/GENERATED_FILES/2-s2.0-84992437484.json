Because current evidence on this topic is inconclusive and long-termfollow-up data are scarce, we wanted to estimate the effect of antibiotic treatment for a first AOM episode occurring during infancy on AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. Methods: We obtained demographic information and risk factors from data of the Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn, a prospective birth cohort study in which all healthy newborns born in Leidsche Rijn (between 2001 and 2012), The Netherlands, were enrolled. These data were linked to children's primary care electronic health records up to the age of four. Children with at least one family physician-diagnosed AOM episode before the age of two were included in analyses. The exposure of interest was the prescription of oral antibiotics (yes vs no) for a child's first AOM episode before the age of two years. Results: 848 children were included in analyses and 512 (60%) children were prescribed antibiotics for their first AOM episode. Antibiotic treatmentwas not associated with an increased risk of total AOM recurrences (adjusted rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.78-1.13), recurrent AOM (\u22653 episodes in 6 months or \u22654 in one year; adjusted risk ratio: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.57-1.11), or with increased AOM-related health care utilization during children's first four years of life. Conclusions: Oral antibiotic treatment of a first AOM episode occurring during infancy does not affect the number of AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. This information can be used when weighing the pros and cons of various AOM treatment options.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Child", "Episode of Care", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Otitis Media", "Recurrence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992437484", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191646298": {"Name": "Te Molder M.", "AuthorID": "57191646298", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "56903984400": {"Name": "De Hoog M.L.A.", "AuthorID": "56903984400", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7006033434": {"Name": "Uiterwaal C.S.P.M.", "AuthorID": "7006033434", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "55588684800": {"Name": "Smit H.A.", "AuthorID": "55588684800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7007062761": {"Name": "Schilder A.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7007062761", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7004739501": {"Name": "Damoiseaux R.A.M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004739501", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "24345784200": {"Name": "Venekamp R.P.", "AuthorID": "24345784200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7003278289": {"Name": "Van Der Ent C.K.", "AuthorID": "7003278289", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
