Bioinformatics methods have long made use of very diverse data sources alone or in combination to predict protein function, with the understanding that different data types help elucidate complementary biological roles. This chapter focuses on methods accepting amino acid sequences as input and producing GO term assignments directly as outputs; the relevant biological and computational concepts are presented along with the advantages and limitations of individual approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["De novo function prediction", "Homology-based annotation transfers", "Multi-domain architecture", "Phylogenomics", "Protein function prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Protein", "Gene Ontology", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Phylogeny", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994509507", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7801377172": {"Name": "Cozzetto D.", "AuthorID": "7801377172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203189821": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57203189821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
