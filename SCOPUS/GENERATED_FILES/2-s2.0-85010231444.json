One-hundred adult male child sexual abusers (M = 45.8 years, SD = 12.2; range = 20-84) were surveyed about the first time they had sexual contact with a child. Afternoon and early evening (between 3 pm and 9 pm) was the most common time in which sexual contact first occurred. Most incidents occurred in a home. Two-thirds of incidents occurred when another person was in close proximity, usually elsewhere in the home. Older victims were more likely to be sexually abused by someone outside their families and in the later hours of the day compared to younger victims. Proximity of another person (adult and/or child) appeared to have little effect on offenders' decisions to abuse, although it had some impact on the level of intrusion and duration of these incidents. Overall, the findings lend support to the application of the routine activities approach for considering how contextual risk factors (i.e., the timing and relationship context) change as children age, and raise questions about how to best conceptualize guardianship in the context of child sexual abuse. These factors should be key considerations when devising and implementing sexual abuse prevention strategies and for informing theory development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guardianship", "Offence timing", "Routine activities approach", "Sexual abuse onset", "Situational theories", "Victim age"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010231444", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55656149900": {"Name": "McKillop N.", "AuthorID": "55656149900", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith Criminology Institute, Griffith University"}, "6603037767": {"Name": "Smallbone S.", "AuthorID": "6603037767", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith Criminology Institute, Griffith University"}, "7501419538": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "7501419538", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Psychology, Behaviour and Achievement, Coventry University"}, "6603079491": {"Name": "Wortley R.", "AuthorID": "6603079491", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
