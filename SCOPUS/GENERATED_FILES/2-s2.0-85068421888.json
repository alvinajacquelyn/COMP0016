The optimization of the Ar/O 2/CF 4 reactive ion etching (RIE) plasma treatment for diamond substrate smoothing and its effectiveness to remove subsurface polishing damage are characterized. An O 2/CF 4 RIE process and the effect of different process parameters (inductively coupled plasma, platen power, and pressure) were initially examined. This process, however, still produced a detrimental effect to surface roughness, with etch pits across the surface of the sample. The addition of argon to the process achieved near-zero surface pit density and reduced roughness by 20%-44% after 6 and 10 \u03bcm etching. Iterative high-resolution X-ray diffraction measurements provided a nondestructive tool to examine the effectiveness of polishing damage removal and in this case reduced after removal of 6 \u03bcm of material from the surface of the diamond substrate with the smoothing treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diamond substrates", "High performance devices", "High resolution X ray diffraction", "High-quality diamonds", "Nondestructive tools", "Process parameters", "Smooth substrates", "Surface pit densities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068421888", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57192820769": {"Name": "Hicks M.L.", "AuthorID": "57192820769", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56486133800": {"Name": "Pakpour-Tabrizi A.C.", "AuthorID": "56486133800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "22992826600": {"Name": "Jackman R.B.", "AuthorID": "22992826600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55329137400": {"Name": "Zuerbig V.", "AuthorID": "55329137400", "AffiliationID": "60030586", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics IAF"}, "6603417842": {"Name": "Kirste L.", "AuthorID": "6603417842", "AffiliationID": "60030586", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics IAF"}, "7006405412": {"Name": "Nebel C.", "AuthorID": "7006405412", "AffiliationID": "60030586", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics IAF"}}}
