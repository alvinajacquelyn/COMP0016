However, this knowledge is often not implemented. The aim of this study therefore was to identify strategies to implement improvement activities identified in a research project within daily palliative care practice. Methods: A nominal group technique was used with members of the IMPACT consortium, being international researchers and clinicians in cancer care, dementia care and palliative care. Participants identified and prioritized implementation strategies. Data was analyzed qualitatively using inductive coding. Results: Twenty international clinicians and researchers participated in one of two parallel nominal group sessions. The recommended strategies to implement results from a research project were grouped in five common themes: 1. Dissemination of results e.g. by publishing results tailored to relevant audiences, 2. Identification and dissemination of unique selling points, 3. education e.g. by developing e-learning tools and integrating scientific evidence into core curricula, 4. Stimulation of participation of stakeholders, and 5. consideration of consequences e.g. rewarding services for their implementation successes but not services that fail to implement quality improvement activities. Discussion: The added value of this nominal group study lies in the prioritisation by the experts of strategies to influence the implementation of quality improvement activities in palliative care. Efforts to ensure future use of scientific findings should be built into research projects in order to prevent waste of resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Europe", "Implementation strategies", "Nominal group technique", "Palliative care", "Quality improvement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Evidence-Based Practice", "Expert Testimony", "Humans", "Palliative Care", "Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942612283", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55813159800": {"Name": "Van Riet Paap J.", "AuthorID": "55813159800", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ Healthcare), Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7004246935": {"Name": "Vernooij-Dassen M.", "AuthorID": "7004246935", "AffiliationID": "115753844", "AffiliationName": "Kalorama Foundation"}, "57202718744": {"Name": "Vissers K.", "AuthorID": "57202718744", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain and Palliative Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6602306261": {"Name": "Engels Y.", "AuthorID": "6602306261", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain and Palliative Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7005268103": {"Name": "Radbruch L.", "AuthorID": "7005268103", "AffiliationID": "106924662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care, Malteser Hospital Bonn/Rhein-Sieg"}, "6701328928": {"Name": "Hjermstad M.", "AuthorID": "6701328928", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "European Palliative Care Research Centre, Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "6602946090": {"Name": "Chattat R.", "AuthorID": "6602946090", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bologna"}}}
