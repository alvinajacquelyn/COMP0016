We focus on the porting and optimization of Splotch, a scalable visualization algorithm, to utilize the Xeon Phi, Intel\u2019s coprocessor based upon the new many integrated core architecture. We discuss steps taken to offload data to the coprocessor and algorithmic modifications to aid faster processing on the many-core architecture and make use of the uniquely wide vector capabilities of the device, with accompanying performance results using multiple Xeon Phi. Finally we compare performance against results achieved with the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) based implementation of Splotch.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GPU", "high-performance computing", "optimization", "visualization", "Xeon Phi"], "IndexKeywords": ["High performance computing", "Integrated core", "Many-core architecture", "Scalable visualization", "Xeon Phi"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035009400", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"57197807436": {"Name": "Dykes T.", "AuthorID": "57197807436", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "School of Creative Technologies, University of Portsmouth"}, "6602409346": {"Name": "Krokos M.", "AuthorID": "6602409346", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "School of Creative Technologies, University of Portsmouth"}, "6506459819": {"Name": "Gheller C.", "AuthorID": "6506459819", "AffiliationID": "114325616", "AffiliationName": "CSCS-ETHZ"}, "6507023221": {"Name": "Rivi M.", "AuthorID": "6507023221", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}}}
