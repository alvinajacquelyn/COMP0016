Potential moderator variables, their interaction with treatment group (CBT, TCBT) and baseline levels of OCD severity were entered into separate regression models where the primary outcome measure was the post-intervention Children\u2019s Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Scale total score (CYBOCS). Separate regressions were also used to test associations between predictors and outcome controlling for pretreatment CYBOCS. Only pretreatment level of parent-rated child peer problems moderated the effects of the two interventions on CYBOCS severity at post-treatment. After controlling for baseline CYBOCS, only family accommodation rated by mothers predicted poorer outcomes in both groups. While CBT and TCBT may be equally effective for adolescents with OCD, the current results tentatively suggest that higher baseline level of peer problems strengthened the response to therapy for youth receiving TCBT and the predictor analyses reinforce the importance of directly addressing family accommodation during CBT for paediatric OCD regardless of delivery mode. Limitations of the current findings and directions for future work are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "cognitive behaviour therapy", "moderators", "obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder", "predictors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Single-Blind Method", "Telephone", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053481346", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"57200043799": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "57200043799", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Psychology, Australian National University"}, "57188957685": {"Name": "O\u2019Kearney R.", "AuthorID": "57188957685", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Psychology, Australian National University"}, "7402367352": {"Name": "Turner C.", "AuthorID": "7402367352", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, The University of Queensland"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004084003": {"Name": "Mataix-Cols D.", "AuthorID": "7004084003", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7006183801": {"Name": "Lovell K.", "AuthorID": "7006183801", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nursing, Midwifery & Social Work, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "35275280100": {"Name": "Krebs G.", "AuthorID": "35275280100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "55696319500": {"Name": "Lang K.", "AuthorID": "55696319500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7003610970": {"Name": "Byford S.", "AuthorID": "7003610970", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}}}
