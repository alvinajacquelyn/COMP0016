In each case, low complexity implies a form of singularity confinement which results in a known discrete Painlev\u00e9 equation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algebraic entropy", "Diophantine integrability", "Discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations", "Order of meromorphic solutions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065206740", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"6603577604": {"Name": "Halburd R.", "AuthorID": "6603577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "10042689000": {"Name": "Korhonen R.", "AuthorID": "10042689000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Eastern Finland"}}}
