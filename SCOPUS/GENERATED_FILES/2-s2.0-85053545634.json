A challenge is to identify individuals at risk for conflict and factors that potentially reduce conflict. This study investigated how gender and socioeconomic status (SES) were associated with work\u2013family interference (WFI) and family\u2013work interference (FWI) and how control at work and at home related to WFI and FWI. Data from 1991\u20131993 and 1997\u20131999 of the Whitehall II study of British civil servants, including 3484 (827 women and 2657 men) employees in three SES-levels, were analysed. Women reported a higher risk for WFI and FWI. High SES employees reported higher WFI. Less control at home increased risks for WFI and FWI as did low control at work but only for WFI. This suggests that high SES women are especially at risk for conflict and that aspects from the spheres of both work and home should be considered in further research and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Control", "family\u2013work conflict", "gender", "socioeconomic status", "work\u2013family conflict"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053545634", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"14037228000": {"Name": "Falkenberg H.", "AuthorID": "14037228000", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm University"}, "6602300176": {"Name": "Lindfors P.", "AuthorID": "6602300176", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm University"}, "6701531085": {"Name": "Chandola T.", "AuthorID": "6701531085", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "7202619429": {"Name": "Head J.", "AuthorID": "7202619429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
