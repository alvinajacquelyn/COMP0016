For efficient scattering of THz radiation, the probe, fabricated from indium, is designed to resonate like a dipole antenna. Efficient excitation is achieved by integrating the probe with a radially-polarized THz source. Using time-domain spectroscopy (TDS), we observe resonant enhancement of the scattered fields, and using aperture-type near-field microscopy, we see high field confinement at the scattering probe apex.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Near-field microscopy", "Terahertz imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Near field microscopy", "Near field probes", "Radially polarized", "Resonant enhancements", "Resonant scattering", "Terahertz frequencies", "Terahertz imaging", "Time domain spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050180617", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57188976874": {"Name": "Siday T.", "AuthorID": "57188976874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "55312030000": {"Name": "Natrella M.", "AuthorID": "55312030000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
