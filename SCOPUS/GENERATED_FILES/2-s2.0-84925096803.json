Screening for Barrett's esophagus, which is the known precursor of a large majority of adenocarcinomas, has been debated without a firm consensus. Given evidence for and against perceived benefits of screening, the multitude of challenges in the implementation of such a strategy and in the downstream management of subjects with Barrett's esophagus who could be diagnosed by screening, support for screening has been modest. Recent advances in the form of development and initial accuracy of noninvasive tools for screening, risk assessment tools, and biomarker panels to risk stratify subjects with BE, have spurred renewed interest in the early detection of Barrett's esophagus and related neoplasia, particularly with the advent of effective endoscopic therapy. In this review, we explore in depth the potential rationale for screening for Barrett's esophagus, recent advances that have the potential of making screening feasible, and also highlight some of the challenges that will have to be overcome to develop an effective approach to improve the outcomes of subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrett's Esophagus", "Esophageal Adenocarcinoma", "Risk Stratification", "Screening", "Screening Tools"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Barrett Esophagus", "Early Diagnosis", "Endoscopy", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Secondary Prevention"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925096803", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55912766000": {"Name": "Sami S.S.", "AuthorID": "55912766000", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham, Digestive Diseases Centre, National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Unit"}, "6603107719": {"Name": "Ragunath K.", "AuthorID": "6603107719", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham, Digestive Diseases Centre, National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Unit"}, "55369361300": {"Name": "Iyer P.G.", "AuthorID": "55369361300", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Barrett's Esophagus Unit, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}}}
