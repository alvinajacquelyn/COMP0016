The EIT wave was observed by both SDO and STEREO-A, allowing a three-dimensional examination of how the propagation of the disturbance was affected both by a neighbouring coronal hole and a trans-equatorial loop system. In addition, the eruption was observed at the limb by the ground-based CoMP instrument, allowing the Doppler motion associated with the eruption and resulting coronal loop oscillation to be investigated in detail. This combination of data-sets provides a unique insight into the three-dimensional evolution of the EIT wave and its effects on the surrounding corona.", "AuthorKeywords": ["shock waves", "Sun: corona", "Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)", "Sun: flares"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054282499", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57211231301": {"Name": "Long D.M.", "AuthorID": "57211231301", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "25825393800": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Su\u00e1rez D.", "AuthorID": "25825393800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "22954929800": {"Name": "Valori G.", "AuthorID": "22954929800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}}}
