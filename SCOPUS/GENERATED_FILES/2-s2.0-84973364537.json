Pore dynamics determine release and vesicle recycling kinetics, but pore properties are poorly known because biochemically defined single-pore assays are lacking. We isolated single flickering pores connecting v-SNARE-reconstituted nanodiscs to cells ectopically expressing cognate, \"flipped\" t-SNAREs. Conductance through single, voltage-clamped fusion pores directly reported sub-millisecond pore dynamics. Pore currents fluctuated, transiently returned to baseline multiple times, and disappeared \u223c6 s after initial opening, as if the fusion pore fluctuated in size, flickered, and resealed. We found that interactions between v- and t-SNARE transmembrane domains (TMDs) promote, but are not essential for pore nucleation. Surprisingly, TMD modifications designed to disrupt v- and t-SNARE TMD zippering prolonged pore lifetimes dramatically. We propose that the post-fusion geometry of the proteins contribute to pore stability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium", "Cell Fusion", "Cell Nucleus", "Exocytosis", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Membrane Fusion", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Secretory Vesicles", "SNARE Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973364537", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57188809204": {"Name": "Wu Z.", "AuthorID": "57188809204", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Nanobiology Institute, Yale University"}, "55303731200": {"Name": "Vennekate W.", "AuthorID": "55303731200", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Nanobiology Institute, Yale University"}, "57189601307": {"Name": "Dudzinski N.R.", "AuthorID": "57189601307", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Nanobiology Institute, Yale University"}, "6603207333": {"Name": "Karatekin E.", "AuthorID": "6603207333", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Neurophotonique, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences Fondamentales et Biom\u00e9dicales, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR8250"}, "57105283200": {"Name": "Auclair S.M.", "AuthorID": "57105283200", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Yale University"}, "54911686500": {"Name": "Bello O.", "AuthorID": "54911686500", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Yale University"}, "16245253100": {"Name": "Krishnakumar S.S.", "AuthorID": "16245253100", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Yale University"}}}
