All rights reserved.Psoriasis is a common, chronic, autoimmune condition characterized by excessive growth and differentiation of keratinocytes that affects approximately 1% to 3% of the general population in the United States. Mounting evidence has led to an increasing awareness that psoriasis as a disease is more than \"skin deep\" and that it shares systemic manifestations with other chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's and diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have not only shown an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in psoriasis but have also identified psoriasis as an independent risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. This calls for an approach beyond managing traditional risk factors, which remain the standard guidelines at present.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cardiovascular disease", "Cardiovascular risk factors", "Prevention", "Psoriasis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Psoriasis", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943816936", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56899087900": {"Name": "Benson M.", "AuthorID": "56899087900", "AffiliationID": "60025356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, New York Methodist Hospital"}, "21739754800": {"Name": "Frishman W.", "AuthorID": "21739754800", "AffiliationID": "60027042, 60029961", "AffiliationName": "New York Medical College, Westchester Medical Center"}}}
