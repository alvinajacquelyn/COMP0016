Okapi are highly elusive and very little is known about their behaviour and ecology in the wild. We used non-invasive genetic methods to examine the social structure, mating system and dispersal for a population of okapi in the R\u00e9serve de Faune a; Okapis, DRC. Okapi individuals were found to be solitary, but genetically polygamous or promiscuous. There was no evidence for any close spatial association between large groups of related or unrelated okapi for either sex, but we did find evidence for male-biased dispersal. An isolation by distance pattern of genetic similarity was present, but appears to be operating just below the spatial scale of the area investigated in the present study. We describe how the analyses used here can infer aspects of behavioural ecology and discuss the strengths and limitations of these analyses. We therefore provide a guide for future studies using non-invasive genetics to investigate behavioural ecology of rare, elusive animals. This study furthers scientific knowledge about a species that has recently been recognized by the IUCN as endangered, and is a potentially important flagship species for Central Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elusive species", "Endangered", "Genetics", "Mating system", "Non-invasive", "Okapi", "Polygamous", "Social structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925635547", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"55820272200": {"Name": "Stanton D.W.G.", "AuthorID": "55820272200", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "56840234000": {"Name": "Bruford M.W.", "AuthorID": "56840234000", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55319293600": {"Name": "Hart J.", "AuthorID": "55319293600", "AffiliationID": "113700457", "AffiliationName": "Projet Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba (TL2), Lukuru Foundation"}, "8537811800": {"Name": "K\u00fcmpel N.F.", "AuthorID": "8537811800", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Programmes, Zoological Society of London"}, "55440232200": {"Name": "Nixon S.", "AuthorID": "55440232200", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Programmes, Zoological Society of London"}, "55360030600": {"Name": "Vosper A.", "AuthorID": "55360030600", "AffiliationID": "115099679", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Great Ape and Human Impact Monitoring, Okapi Faunal Reserve"}, "7005260657": {"Name": "Ewen J.G.", "AuthorID": "7005260657", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57202341952": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57202341952", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
