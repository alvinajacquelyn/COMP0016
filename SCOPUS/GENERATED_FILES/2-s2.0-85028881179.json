We will present quantitative methods to measure the size of evolutionary steps within a structural domain, allowing the correlation between change in substrate and domain structure to be assessed, and giving insights into the evolvability of different domains in terms of the number, types and sizes of evolutionary steps observed. These approaches will help to understand the evolution of new catalytic and non-catalytic functionality in response to environmental demands, showing potential to guide de novoenzyme design and directed evolution experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "Enzyme Activation", "Enzymes", "Substrate Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028881179", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55156530900": {"Name": "Tyzack J.", "AuthorID": "55156530900", "AffiliationID": "60026124", "AffiliationName": "EMBL-EBI"}, "7402781853": {"Name": "Thornton J.", "AuthorID": "7402781853", "AffiliationID": "60026124", "AffiliationName": "EMBL-EBI"}, "12244914800": {"Name": "Furnham N.", "AuthorID": "12244914800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36913138800": {"Name": "Sillitoe I.", "AuthorID": "36913138800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56748802200": {"Name": "Orengo C.", "AuthorID": "56748802200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
