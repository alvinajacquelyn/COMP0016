First, we consider the Misandry Mermaid Tumblr, exploring how the site remediates antifeminist discourses of man-hating by deploying a sarcastic discourse of misandry. We argue the site is plagued, however, by a form of gender binary antagonism. Second we explore an anti-manspreading site savingroomforcats, showing how the site challenges hetero-masculine spatial dominance through the humorous insertion of cats into manspreading images. We also argue that these posts tend to lack an intersectional awareness of racialised masculinity. Finally, we explore the site critiquemydickpic, which subverts dominant understandings of dick pics as threatening, generating a queer politics of disrupting phallic-oriented desire.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital activism", "memes", "misogyny", "social media"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045727610", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"18042366600": {"Name": "Ringrose J.", "AuthorID": "18042366600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57201686000": {"Name": "Lawrence E.", "AuthorID": "57201686000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
