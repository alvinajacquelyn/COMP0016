Tracking calorimeter experiments have particular strengths, including the ability to search for this decay amongst several different isotopes hosted in source foils. Full event reconstruction provides powerful background rejection capability, and, in the event of a discovery, topological measurements are a powerful handle to determine the nature of the lepton number violating process. I will present the latest results from the NEMO-3 experiment together with the current status and future prospects for its successor: SuperNEMO.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Background rejection capability", "Current status", "Event reconstruction", "Future prospects", "Lepton number", "Lepton number violations", "Neutrino mass", "Neutrinoless double-beta decays"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052094681", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"26658869400": {"Name": "Cascella M.", "AuthorID": "26658869400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
