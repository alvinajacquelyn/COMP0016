Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying the progression of MSA remain unknown. Animal models of human diseases that recapitulate their clinical, biochemical and pathological features are indispensable for increasing our understanding of their underlying molecular mechanisms, which allows preclinical studies to be advanced. Because the onset of MSA occurs in middle age, an animal model that first manifests abnormal protein aggregates in adulthood would be most appropriate. We therefore used the Cre-loxP system to express inducible \u03b1-synuclein (Syn), a major component of the pathological hallmark of MSA, to generate a mouse model of MSA. Beginning in adulthood, these MSA model mice express excessive levels of Syn in oligodendrocytes, resulting in abnormal Syn accumulation and modifications similar to those observed in human MSA pathology. Additionally, MSA model mice exhibit some clinical features of MSA, including decreased motor activity. These findings suggest that this new mouse model of MSA represents a useful tool for analyzing the pathophysiological alterations that underlie the progression of this disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cre-loxP technique", "Model mouse", "Multiple system atrophy", "Oligodendrocyte", "Phosphorylation", "\u03b1-Synuclein"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Animals", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Activity", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Oligodendroglia", "Phosphorylation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063396092", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"7102691053": {"Name": "Tanji K.", "AuthorID": "7102691053", "AffiliationID": "60019579, 60033085", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "35242985300": {"Name": "Miki Y.", "AuthorID": "35242985300", "AffiliationID": "60019579, 60033085", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7102953042": {"Name": "Mori F.", "AuthorID": "7102953042", "AffiliationID": "60019579, 60033085", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "57207962062": {"Name": "Narita H.", "AuthorID": "57207962062", "AffiliationID": "60189605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki University of Health and Welfare"}, "55504501300": {"Name": "Wakabayashi K.", "AuthorID": "55504501300", "AffiliationID": "60019579, 60033085", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "25958303500": {"Name": "Nikaido Y.", "AuthorID": "25958303500", "AffiliationID": "60019579, 60033085", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7006937876": {"Name": "Kakita A.", "AuthorID": "7006937876", "AffiliationID": "60022313, 60176067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Brain Research Institute, University of Niigata"}, "57192151202": {"Name": "Takahashi H.", "AuthorID": "57192151202", "AffiliationID": "60022313, 60176067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Brain Research Institute, University of Niigata"}}}
