All rights reserved.Regardless of the excellent properties of glass ionomer cements, their poor mechanical properties limit their applications to non-load bearing areas. This study aimed to investigate the effect of incorporated short, chopped and randomly distributed flax fibers (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 25 wt%) on setting reaction kinetics, and mechanical and morphological properties of glass ionomer cements. Addition of flax fibers did not significantly affect the setting reaction extent. According to their content, flax fibers increased the compressive (from 148 to 250 MPa) and flexure strength (from 20 to 42 MPa). They also changed the brittle behavior of glass ionomer cements to a plastic one. They significantly reduced the compressive (from 3 to 1.3 GPa) and flexure modulus (from 19 to 14 GPa). Accordingly, flax fiber-modified glass ionomer cements could be potentially used in high-stress bearing areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flax fibre", "Glass ionomer cements", "Setting kinetics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019733536", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"12243558900": {"Name": "Abou Neel E.", "AuthorID": "12243558900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57203734351": {"Name": "Young A.", "AuthorID": "57203734351", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
