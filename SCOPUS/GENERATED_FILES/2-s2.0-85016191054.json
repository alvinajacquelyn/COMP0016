We propose a novel Gaussian process (GP) autoencoder modeling approach. In particular, we introduce GP encoders to project multiple observed features onto a latent space, while GP decoders are responsible for reconstructing the original features. Inference is performed in a novel variational framework, where the recovered latent representations are further constrained by the ordinal output labels. In this way, we seamlessly integrate the ordinal structure in the learned manifold, while attaining robust fusion of the input features. We demonstrate the representation abilities of our model on benchmark datasets from machine learning and affect analysis. We further evaluate the model on the tasks of feature fusion and joint ordinal prediction of facial action units. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the state of the art.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Affect analysis", "Benchmark datasets", "Gaussian process", "Gaussian Processes", "Model approach", "Ordinal structure", "State of the art", "Variational framework"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016191054", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36998592400": {"Name": "Eleftheriadis S.", "AuthorID": "36998592400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "27868018100": {"Name": "Rudovic O.", "AuthorID": "27868018100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "24922891000": {"Name": "Deisenroth M.P.", "AuthorID": "24922891000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "56259551600": {"Name": "Pantic M.", "AuthorID": "56259551600", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "EEMCS, University of Twente"}}}
