This work aims at providing a fundamental understanding of the mixing and stretching dynamics occurring in a reactor in the presence of a vortical structure, and the vortex ring was selected as a flow paradigm of vortices commonly encountered in stirred and shaken reactors in laminar flow conditions. High resolution laser induced fluorescence and particle imaging velocimetry measurements were carried out to fully resolve the flow dissipative scales and provide a complete data set to fully assess macro- and micro-mixing characteristics. The analysis builds upon the Lamb-Oseen vortex work of Meunier and Villermaux [\"How vortices mix,\" J. Fluid Mech. 476, 213-222 (2003)] and the engulfment model of Baldyga and Bourne [\"Simplification of micromixing calculations. I. Derivation and application of new model,\" Chem. Eng. J. 42, 83-92 (1989); \"Simplification of micromixing calculations. II. New applications,\" ibid. 42, 93-101 (1989)] which are valid for diffusion-free conditions, and a comparison is made between three methodologies to assess mixing characteristics. The first method is commonly used in macro-mixing studies and is based on a control area analysis by estimating the variation in time of the concentration standard deviation, while the other two are formulated to provide an insight into local segregation dynamics, by either using an iso-concentration approach or an iso-concentration gradient approach to take into account diffusion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biopharmaceuticals production", "Concentration gradients", "Laminar flow conditions", "Laser induced fluorescence", "Mixing characteristics", "Particle imaging velocimetry", "Pharmaceutical industry", "Segregation dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010208241", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"15724255800": {"Name": "Bouremel Y.", "AuthorID": "15724255800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8259228300": {"Name": "Ducci A.", "AuthorID": "8259228300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
