The video presents a study of the life of Brussels\u2019 vast, late-nineteenth-century court building. In Palais de Justice, Young presents \u2018a legal system seemingly centered on, and perhaps controlled by women\u2019. The respondents are Jeanne Gaakeer, Ruth Herz, Joan Kee, Linda Mulcahy, Jeremy Pilcher and Gary Watt. Jeanne Gaakeer and Ruth Herz have the distinction of being, not only internationally respected scholars, but also experienced judges. Jeanne Gaakeer is a judge practicing in the Netherlands and Ruth Herz was formerly a judge in Germany. The six responses are followed by the artist\u2019s own reflections on her artwork and her response to the commentators\u2019 responses. Joan Kee writes that \u2018Young highlights access as a key entry point for thinking about the law. Who can avail themselves of the law? Who may enter (or exit) the courts? Who is excluded and by whose authority? The surreptitious looking and peering that define the experience of watching the film suggests how these questions deny ready answers\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Architecture", "Art", "Brussels", "Camera", "Clandestine", "Documentary", "Lens", "Palais de justice", "Women judges", "Women lawyers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055345026", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"53876009000": {"Name": "Gaakeer J.", "AuthorID": "53876009000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "The Court of Appeal in The Hague"}, "57204361902": {"Name": "Herz R.", "AuthorID": "57204361902", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "School of Law Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55354984800": {"Name": "Pilcher J.", "AuthorID": "55354984800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "School of Law Birkbeck, University of London"}, "52963774300": {"Name": "Kee J.", "AuthorID": "52963774300", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan"}, "7003900372": {"Name": "Mulcahy L.", "AuthorID": "7003900372", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics"}, "57193027657": {"Name": "Watt G.", "AuthorID": "57193027657", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Law, University of Warwick"}, "57204361297": {"Name": "Young C.", "AuthorID": "57204361297", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
