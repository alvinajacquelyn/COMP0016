However, a GIS can be difficult to use and may require understanding of a number of concepts as well as tools and technology. This complexity is compounded by additional challenges commonly encountered in IDR. This paper examines some of the challenges facing learners of GIS in IDR projects, with a particular focus on the appropriateness of current teaching methods in this context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["education", "geographic information systems", "interdisciplinary research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931567244", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56404634600": {"Name": "Rickles P.", "AuthorID": "56404634600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Chorley Institute, University College London"}, "12767125600": {"Name": "Ellul C.", "AuthorID": "12767125600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
