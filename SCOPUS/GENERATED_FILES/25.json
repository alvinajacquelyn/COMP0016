We prove an analog of Sabidussi's theorem for each of these parameters, i.e., that for each of the parameters, the value on the Cartesian product of graphs is equal to the maximum of the values on the factors. Interestingly, as a consequence of this result for (Formula presented.), we obtain analog of Hedetniemi's conjecture, i.e., that the value of (Formula presented.) on the categorical product of graphs is equal to the minimum of its values on the factors. We conjecture that the analogous results hold for vector and quantum chromatic number, and we prove that this is the case for some special classes of graphs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["05C15", "05C50", "05C62"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922379033", "SubjectAreas": [["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"6602289962": {"Name": "Godsil C.", "AuthorID": "6602289962", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Combinatorics and Optimization, University of Waterloo"}, "53878260000": {"Name": "Roberson D.", "AuthorID": "53878260000", "AffiliationID": "60095095, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University"}, "7004860337": {"Name": "\u0160\u00e1mal R.", "AuthorID": "7004860337", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Institute of Charles University"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
