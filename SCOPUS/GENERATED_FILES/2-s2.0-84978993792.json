Widening the debate over the \u2018contested\u2019 and the \u2018ordinary\u2019, this paper tries to address such questions whilst engaging with Giorgio Agamben\u2019s powerful concept of paradigms. Considering Jerusalem a super, hyper-exceptional case trapped in the tension between particularism and exceptionalism, the paper reflects on Agamben\u2019s approach to examples\u2014or paradigms\u2014which deeply engage the powers of analogy, enabling discernment between previously unseen affinities among singular objects by stepping outside established systems of classification. The paper suggests a possible new concept, \u2018whatever urbanism\u2019, to disentangle the apparent dichotomy between \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018contested\u2019 as urban labels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agamben", "contested urbanism", "Jerusalem", "paradigm", "whatever"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978993792", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"34874608400": {"Name": "Boano C.", "AuthorID": "34874608400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, University College London"}}}
