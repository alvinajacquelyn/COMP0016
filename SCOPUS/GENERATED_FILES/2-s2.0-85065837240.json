The accelerated use of nanomaterials has increased the potential discharge of nanomaterials into the environment in different ways. The aquatic environment is mainly susceptible as it is likely to act as an ultimate sink for all contaminants. Therefore, this study assessed the toxicological impacts of waterborne engineered copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) on histology, lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) levels in the gills of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Nanoparticles were characterized by XRD and SEM techniques. Before starting the sub-acute toxicity testing, 96 h LC50 of Cu-NPs for C. carpio was calculated as 4.44 mg/l. Then based on LC50, C. carpio of 40\u201345 g in weight were exposed to three sub-lethal doses of waterborne engineered Cu-NPs (0 or 0.5 or 1 or 1.5 mg/l) for a period of 14 days. The waterborne Cu-NPs have appeared to induce alterations in gill histology and oxidative stress parameters in a dose-dependent manner. The gill tissues showed degenerative secondary lamellae, necrotic lamella, fused lamella, necrosis of the primary and secondary lamella, edema, complete degeneration, epithelial lifting, degenerative epithelium, and hyperplasia in a dose-dependent manner. In the gill tissues, waterborne Cu-NPs caused a decreased level of CAT and elevated levels of LPO, and GSH in the fish exposed to the highest dose of 1.5 mg Cu-NPs/l of water. Our results indicate that the exposure to waterborne Cu-NPs was toxic to the aquatic organisms as shown by the oxidative stresses and histological alterations in C. carpio, a freshwater fish of good economic value.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antioxidant enzymes", "Cu nanoparticles", "Cyprinus carpio", "histopathology", "oxidative stress", "toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065837240", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"], ["Chemical Health and Safety", "CENG", "1504"]], "AuthorData": {"57200730985": {"Name": "Noureen A.", "AuthorID": "57200730985", "AffiliationID": "60053707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Virtual University Lahore"}, "35210272700": {"Name": "Jabeen F.", "AuthorID": "35210272700", "AffiliationID": "60070615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Government College University Faisalabad"}, "55647598200": {"Name": "Ali M.", "AuthorID": "55647598200", "AffiliationID": "60070615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Government College University Faisalabad"}, "54409880500": {"Name": "Yaqub S.", "AuthorID": "54409880500", "AffiliationID": "60070615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Government College University Faisalabad"}, "55484476700": {"Name": "Tabish T.A.", "AuthorID": "55484476700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "14012402700": {"Name": "Iqbal R.", "AuthorID": "14012402700", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "24779643900": {"Name": "Shakoor Chaudhry A.", "AuthorID": "24779643900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University"}}}
