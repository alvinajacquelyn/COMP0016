Due to the retreat of widespread sulphidic conditions, redox-sensitive trace-metals could accumulate to a greater extent in \u2018black shales\u2019 deposited in localized anoxic/euxinic environments, such as highly productive ocean margins. This study investigates the concentrations of the redox-sensitive trace-metals molybdenum and vanadium in organic-rich sedimentary rocks from seven sections of the Yangtze Platform, slope and basin. Iron speciation analyses were carried out in order to distinguish oxic, anoxic-ferruginous and anoxic-sulphidic settings, while sulphur and nitrogen isotope ratios were measured to gain insight into sulphate and nitrate availability, respectively, in the context of changing redox conditions. The data herein demonstrate an overall increase in redox-sensitive trace-metal contents in black shales across the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition, but with marked temporal and spatial variability. Euxinia is evident in South China before 551 Ma in the Ediacaran, and again in the early Cambrian. However, some time-equivalent sections are not enriched in redox-sensitive trace-metals, and also exhibit contrasting S-isotope and N-isotope systematics. A more complex configuration of the Yangtze Platform, for example with vast intrashelf basins, together with changing (generally rising) eustatic sea-level may account for this variability. In this regard, it is proposed that a mid-depth sulphidic wedge, caused by nutrient upwelling over the south-east platform margins, migrated over time (but generally landward), leading to spatially variable redox conditions determined by sea-level, currents and bathymetric constraints. The changing extents of anoxia and euxinia appear to have limited the distribution of emerging Ediacaran and Cambrian ecosystems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cambrian", "Ediacaran", "Iron speciation", "Neoproterozoic", "Nitrogen isotopes", "Redox-sensitive trace-metals", "Sulphide isotopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cambrians", "Ediacaran", "Iron speciations", "Neoproterozoic", "Nitrogen isotopes", "Trace metal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946226077", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"]], "AuthorData": {"37041710200": {"Name": "Och L.M.", "AuthorID": "37041710200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57211684651": {"Name": "Cremonese L.", "AuthorID": "57211684651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "14626549300": {"Name": "Shields-Zhou G.A.", "AuthorID": "14626549300", "AffiliationID": "60012060, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "18042674000": {"Name": "Zhu M.", "AuthorID": "18042674000", "AffiliationID": "60012060, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7004422917": {"Name": "Poulton S.W.", "AuthorID": "7004422917", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "55641233200": {"Name": "Struck U.", "AuthorID": "55641233200", "AffiliationID": "60072319", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Evolutions- und Biodiversit\u00e4tsforschung, Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde"}, "7202062675": {"Name": "Ling H.", "AuthorID": "7202062675", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Department of Earth Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "55704094300": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "55704094300", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Department of Earth Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "54392772100": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "54392772100", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Department of Earth Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "37049962000": {"Name": "Manning C.", "AuthorID": "37049962000", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7004811426": {"Name": "Thirlwall M.", "AuthorID": "7004811426", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "55522279500": {"Name": "Strauss H.", "AuthorID": "55522279500", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Geology and Paleontology, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster"}}}
