We demonstrate the development of a single-step electron beam lithography procedure to fabricate niobium nanobridges with dimensions down to 40 nm \u00d7 100 nm. The single-step process facilitates fabrication that is scalable to complex circuits that require many junctions. We measure the IV-characteristics (IVC) of the nanobridges between temperatures of 4.2 and 9 K and find agreement with numerical simulations and the analytical resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. Furthermore, we investigate the behaviour of the nanobridges under rf irradiation and observe the characteristic microwave-induced Shapiro steps. Our simulated IVC under rf irradiation using both the RSJ model and circuit simulator JSIM are in agreement with the experimental data. As a potential use of nanobridges in circuits requiring many junctions, we investigate the theoretical performance of a nanobridge-based Josephson comparator circuit using JSIM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Josephson junction", "JSIM", "nanobridge", "Shapiro steps", "superconductivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Josephson-junction", "JSIM", "Nanobridge", "Resistively shunted junctions", "Shapiro steps", "Single flux quantum", "Single-step process", "Theoretical performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032815540", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"36718182200": {"Name": "Shelly C.D.", "AuthorID": "36718182200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road"}, "6701461985": {"Name": "See P.", "AuthorID": "6701461985", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road"}, "10739424400": {"Name": "Ireland J.", "AuthorID": "10739424400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road"}, "55728536800": {"Name": "Williams J.M.", "AuthorID": "55728536800", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road"}, "6701351606": {"Name": "Romans E.J.", "AuthorID": "6701351606", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
