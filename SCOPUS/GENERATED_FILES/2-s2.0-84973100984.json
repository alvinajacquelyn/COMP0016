Activation of signaling pathways downstream from purinergic receptors may also be implicated in transplantation and related vascular injury. Following transplantation, the proinflammatory \u201cdanger signal\u201d adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released from damaged cells and promotes proliferation and activation of a variety of immune cells. Targeting purinergic signaling pathways may promote immunosuppression and ameliorate inflammation. Under pathophysiological conditions, nucleotide-scavenging ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 hydrolyze ATP, ultimately, to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Adenosine suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improved graft survival and decreased severity of graft-versus-host disease. Furthermore, purinergic signaling is involved both directly and indirectly in the mechanism of action of several existing immunosuppressive drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Targeting of purinergic receptor pathways, particularly in the setting of combination therapies, could become a valuable immunosuppressive strategy in transplantation. This review focuses on the role of the purinergic signaling pathway in transplantation and immunosuppression and explores possible future applications in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Organ Transplantation", "Purines", "Receptors, Purinergic", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973100984", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6602230885": {"Name": "Zeiser R.", "AuthorID": "6602230885", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University"}, "35403105100": {"Name": "Robson S.", "AuthorID": "35403105100", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Transplant Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "56830494100": {"Name": "Vaikunthanathan T.", "AuthorID": "56830494100", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Division of Transplantation Immunology and Mucosal Biology, MRC Centre for Transplantation, King\u2019s College London"}, "23033784600": {"Name": "Dworak M.", "AuthorID": "23033784600", "AffiliationID": "60012797", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Movement and Neurosciences, German Sport University Cologne"}, "36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}}}
