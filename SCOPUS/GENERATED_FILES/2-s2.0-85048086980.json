However, the presence of water, which is a very strong IR absorber and incompatible with the vacuum working conditions of all analytical methods using soft x-rays and electrons, poses severe constraint to perform important imaging and spectroscopic analyses under physiological conditions. Recent advances to separate the sample compartment in liquid cell are based on electron and photon transparent but molecular-impermeable graphene membranes. This strategy has opened a unique opportunity to explore technological materials under realistic operation conditions using various types of electron microscopy. However, the widespread of the graphene liquid cell applications is still impeded by the lack of well-established approaches for their massive production. We report on the first preliminary results for the fabrication of reproducible graphene liquid cells appropriate for the analysis of biological specimens in their natural hydrated environment with several crucial analytical techniques, namely FTIR microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, AFM, SEM and TEM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data analysis", "Imaging spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical method", "Biological specimens", "Imaging spectroscopy", "Massive production", "Operation conditions", "Physiological condition", "Structure activity correlations", "Water environments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048086980", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57034251300": {"Name": "Matruglio A.", "AuthorID": "57034251300", "AffiliationID": "116459405", "AffiliationName": "CERIC-ERIC (Central European Research Infrastructure Consortium)"}, "57200391435": {"Name": "Zucchiatti P.", "AuthorID": "57200391435", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "University of Trieste, Graduate School of Nanotechnology"}, "24340887100": {"Name": "Birarda G.", "AuthorID": "24340887100", "AffiliationID": "60033292", "AffiliationName": "Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste"}, "57219629868": {"Name": "D'Amico F.", "AuthorID": "57219629868", "AffiliationID": "60033292", "AffiliationName": "Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste"}, "56261568300": {"Name": "Kiskinova M.", "AuthorID": "56261568300", "AffiliationID": "60033292", "AffiliationName": "Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste"}, "6602731172": {"Name": "Vaccari L.", "AuthorID": "6602731172", "AffiliationID": "60033292", "AffiliationName": "Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste"}, "8510471500": {"Name": "Marmiroli B.", "AuthorID": "8510471500", "AffiliationID": "60109477, 60019663", "AffiliationName": "Graz University of Technology, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry"}, "6701838856": {"Name": "Kocabas C.", "AuthorID": "6701838856", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Material Science Center"}}}
