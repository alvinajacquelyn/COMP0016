This is because taking into account the impact of trading in the market is mathematically equivalent to introducing a regularization on the risk measure. We show here that the impact function determines which regularizer is to be used. We also show that any regularizer based on the norm \u2113p with p > 1 makes the sensitivity of coherent risk measures to estimation error disappear, while regularizers with p < 1 do not. The \u21131 norm represents a border case: its \"soft\" implementation does not remove the instability, but rather shifts its locus, whereas its \"hard\" implementation (including hard limits or a ban on short selling) eliminates it. We demonstrate these effects on the important special case of expected shortfall (ES) which has recently become the global regulatory market risk measure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["estimation error", "expected shortfall", "Portfolio optimization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978959151", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"24775109100": {"Name": "Caccioli F.", "AuthorID": "24775109100", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}, "6603074564": {"Name": "Kondor I.", "AuthorID": "6603074564", "AffiliationID": "60121842", "AffiliationName": "Parmenides Foundation"}, "55162228200": {"Name": "Marsili M.", "AuthorID": "55162228200", "AffiliationID": "60031745", "AffiliationName": "Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics"}, "6602080101": {"Name": "Still S.", "AuthorID": "6602080101", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "Information and Computer Sciences, University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}}}
