The lack of established procedures in this area has made it difficult to establish industry standards. Therefore, it is important to understand resin aging mechanisms and techniques to monitor column aging during operation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chromatography resin aging", "chromatography resin aging mechanisms", "chromatography resin lifetime", "fouling characterisation techniques"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging mechanism", "Biopharmaceutical manufacture", "Chromatography columns", "Chromatography resin", "Industry standards", "Biological Products", "Chromatography", "Laboratory Chemicals", "Technology, Pharmaceutical", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040693609", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"]], "AuthorData": {"56730898900": {"Name": "Nweke M.", "AuthorID": "56730898900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602592324": {"Name": "Bracewell D.", "AuthorID": "6602592324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005406958": {"Name": "Rathore A.", "AuthorID": "7005406958", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Delhi"}}}
