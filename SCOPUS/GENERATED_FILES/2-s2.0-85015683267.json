We aimed to determine the optimal duration for stents in this clinical setting. Patients (aged 2\u201375 years) from six UK hospitals who were undergoing renal transplantation were recruited and randomly assigned to either early stent removal at 5 days (without cystoscopy) or late removal at 6 weeks after transplantation (with cystoscopy). The primary outcome was a composite of stent-related complications defined as pain, visible hematuria, migration, fragmentation, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) within 3 mo of transplantation. Between May 2010 and Nov 2013, we randomly assigned 227 participants, with 205 included in the final analysis of the primary outcome. Stent-related complications were significantly higher in the late versus early stent removal groups (36 of 126 [28.6%] vs. 6 of 79 [7.6%]; p < 0.001). The majority of stent complications consisted of UTIs, with an incidence of 31 of 126 (24.6%) in the late group compared with 6 of 79 (7.6%) in the early group (p = 0.004). We found early stent removal on day 5 significantly reduced stent-related complications and improved quality of life in the first 3 mo after transplantation (ISRCTN09184595).", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical research/practice", "clinical trial", "kidney (allograft) function/dysfunction", "kidney transplantation/nephrology", "quality of life (QOL)", "surgical technique", "urology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Device Removal", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Function Tests", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Prognosis", "Quality of Life", "Risk Factors", "Stents", "Time Factors", "Transplant Recipients", "Ureter", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015683267", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57214160933": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "57214160933", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Urology, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602086650": {"Name": "Koffman G.", "AuthorID": "6602086650", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Urology, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24081517500": {"Name": "Olsburgh J.", "AuthorID": "24081517500", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Urology, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22935342500": {"Name": "Rebollo-Mesa I.", "AuthorID": "22935342500", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Transplantation, King's College Hospital; Global Exploratory Development, UCB Biopharma"}, "55939975400": {"Name": "Ryan E.", "AuthorID": "55939975400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55509589000": {"Name": "Sinha M.D.", "AuthorID": "55509589000", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8358947500": {"Name": "Banga N.", "AuthorID": "8358947500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Transplantation, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55412920000": {"Name": "Macdougall I.C.", "AuthorID": "55412920000", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "57198199510": {"Name": "Webb M.C.", "AuthorID": "57198199510", "AffiliationID": "60028801", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
