Within business groups, we explore the trade-off between inter-firm insurance that enables risk-taking, and inefficient resource allocation. Risk-taking in group affiliated firms leads to higher performance, compared to independent firms, but the impact of proactivity is attenuated. Utilizing Indian data, we show that risk-taking may undermine rather than improve business performance, but this effect is not present in business groups. Proactivity enhances performance, but less so in business groups. Firms can also enhance performance by technological knowledge acquisition, but these effects are not significantly different for various ownership categories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Business groups", "Emerging economies", "Entrepreneurial orientation", "India"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980010180", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"7004351290": {"Name": "Bhaumik S.K.", "AuthorID": "7004351290", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "6603798528": {"Name": "Estrin S.", "AuthorID": "6603798528", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics"}, "6602242626": {"Name": "Mickiewicz T.", "AuthorID": "6602242626", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston University"}}}
