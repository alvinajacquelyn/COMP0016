Unlike the existing literature \u2212 including the most recent critical body of knowledge on planning, resource management and public policy in Israel \u2212 we contend that this transformation must be understood within the framework of settler colonialism. Our main argument is that the growing dominance of neo-liberal policies, expressed in the form of new public management, privatization of space, planning and territorial management, is bound up with Israel\u2019s settler-colonial politics. Based on our detailed study of the dynamics of the privatization of space in Israel, we conceptualize the interplay between centralistic-national territorial management and new public management, free market-driven, privatization-prone, liberal planning and land policies as neo-settler colonialism. This concept focuses on the symbiotic relationships between these two vectors, with the latter providing a new mechanism of colonial control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["decentralization privatization", "Israel", "land", "neo-liberalism", "new public management", "planning", "settler-colonialism", "territory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029584952", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"8632963600": {"Name": "Yacobi H.", "AuthorID": "8632963600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}, "8967152500": {"Name": "Tzfadia E.", "AuthorID": "8967152500", "AffiliationID": "60093537", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Policy and Administration, Sapir College"}}}
