The collection is organized by a two-dimensional array formed from typologies of power grid components and business processes. These two dimensions provide physical and operational outlooks, respectively, for a power grid. The approach for resilience research is based on building a simulation model of a power grid which utilizes a resilience assessment equation to assess baseline resilience to a hazards' profile, then iteratively selects a subset of tools from the collection, and introduces these as interventions in the power grid simulation model. Calculating the difference in resilience associated with each subset supports multicriteria decision-making to find the most convenient subset of interventions for a power grid and hazards' profile. Resilience is an emergent quality of a power grid system, and therefore resilience research and interventions must be system-driven. This paper outlines further research required prior to the practical application of this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Business Process", "Multi criteria decision making", "Power grid simulation", "Power grid system", "Research approach", "Research designs", "Simulation model", "Two-dimensional arrays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068239878", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57214356654": {"Name": "Borisoglebsky D.", "AuthorID": "57214356654", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, UCL"}}}
