We describe a reprocessing of the original Helios ion distribution functions to provide reliable and reproducible data to characterise the proton core population of the solar wind in the inner heliosphere. A systematic fitting of bi-Maxwellian distribution functions was performed to the raw Helios ion distribution function data to extract the proton core number density, velocity, and temperatures parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. We present radial trends of these derived proton parameters, forming a benchmark to which new measurements in the inner heliosphere will be compared. The new dataset has been made openly available for other researchers to use, along with the source code used to generate it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Heliosphere", "Inner heliosphere", "Solar wind", "Solar wind protons"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057325918", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57191359032": {"Name": "Stansby D.", "AuthorID": "57191359032", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "6603697977": {"Name": "Horbury T.", "AuthorID": "6603697977", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "7004117282": {"Name": "Salem C.", "AuthorID": "7004117282", "AffiliationID": "60029392, 60025038", "AffiliationName": "Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California"}, "12244134400": {"Name": "Matteini L.", "AuthorID": "12244134400", "AffiliationID": "60108665, 60123796, 60008134, 60031186, 60028894, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "LESIA, Observatoire de Paris, Universit\u00e9 PSL, CNRS, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Univ.
