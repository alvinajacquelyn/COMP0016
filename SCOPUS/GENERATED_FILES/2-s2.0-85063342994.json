European Journal of Haematology Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: Despite long-standing safe and effective use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) in primary immunodeficiency, clinical data on IgRT in patients with secondary immunodeficiency (SID) due to B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases are limited. Here, we examine the correlation between approved IgRT indications, treatment recommendations, and clinical practice in SID. Methods: An international online survey of 230 physicians responsible for the diagnosis of SID and the prescription of IgRT in patients with hematological malignancies was conducted. Results: Serum immunoglobulin was measured in 83% of patients with multiple myeloma, 76% with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 69% with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most physicians (85%) prescribed IgRT after \u22652 severe infections. In Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United States, immunoglobulin use was above average in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, while in the UK considerably fewer patients received IgRT. The use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin was highest in France (34%) and lowest in Spain (19%). Immunologists measured specific antibody responses, performed test immunization, implemented IgRT, and used subcutaneous immunoglobulin more frequently than physicians overall. Conclusions: The management of SID in hematological malignancies varied regionally. Clinical practice did not reflect treatment guidelines, highlighting the need for robust clinical studies on IgRT in this population and harmonization between countries and disciplines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "hematological disorders", "immunoglobulins", "infection", "international survey", "IVIG", "multiple myeloma", "non-Hodgkin lymphoma", "SCIG", "secondary immunodeficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Management", "Global Health", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Immunoglobulins", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Infection", "Infection Control", "Public Health Surveillance", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063342994", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"6603081774": {"Name": "Na I.K.", "AuthorID": "6603081774", "AffiliationID": "105813861", "AffiliationName": "Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies"}, "35965274600": {"Name": "Buckland M.", "AuthorID": "35965274600", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Immunodeficiency, Royal Free Hospital and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts"}, "7006420543": {"Name": "Agostini C.", "AuthorID": "7006420543", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Padua University"}, "35458685600": {"Name": "Edgar J.D.M.", "AuthorID": "35458685600", "AffiliationID": "60008028", "AffiliationName": "Regional Immunology Service, The Royal Hospitals"}, "6601929817": {"Name": "Friman V.", "AuthorID": "6601929817", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "7004656645": {"Name": "Michallet M.", "AuthorID": "7004656645", "AffiliationID": "60018084", "AffiliationName": "Service d'H\u00e9matologie, Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard"}, "6603882745": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Ram\u00f3n S.", "AuthorID": "6603882745", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60032461, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Inmunolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Universidad Complutense of Madrid"}, "7005281782": {"Name": "Scheibenbogen C.", "AuthorID": "7005281782", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60000762, 60126120, 60030718", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Immunology, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t (FU) Berlin, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"}, "7006456490": {"Name": "Quinti I.", "AuthorID": "7006456490", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome"}}}
