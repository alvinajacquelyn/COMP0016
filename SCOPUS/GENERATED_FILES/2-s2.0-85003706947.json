Although mutations in NR5A1 are known to cause 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and 46,XX ovarian insufficiency, such mutations have not been implicated in testicular development of 46,XX gonads. Here, we identified identical NR5A1 mutations in two unrelated Japanese patients with 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular DSD. The p.Arg92Trp mutation was absent from the clinically normal mothers and from 200 unaffected Japanese individuals. In silico analyses scored p.Arg92Trp as probably pathogenic. In vitro assays demonstrated that compared with wild-type NR5A1, the mutant protein was less sensitive to NR0B1-induced suppression on the SOX9 enhancer element. Other sequence variants found in the patients were unlikely to be associated with the phenotype. The results raise the possibility that specific mutations in NR5A1 underlie testicular development in genetic females.", "AuthorKeywords": ["46,XX ovotesticular DSD", "46,XX testicular DSD", "NR0B1", "NR5A1", "SOX9"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Biomarkers", "Disorders of Sex Development", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Female", "Genotype", "Gonads", "Humans", "Infant", "Karyotype", "Male", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation, Missense", "Phenotype", "Protein Conformation", "Steroidogenic Factor 1", "Testis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003706947", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55789219200": {"Name": "Igarashi M.", "AuthorID": "55789219200", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Endocrinology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "9236660900": {"Name": "Miyado M.", "AuthorID": "9236660900", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Endocrinology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "35390869500": {"Name": "Ogata T.", "AuthorID": "35390869500", "AffiliationID": "60005684", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine"}, "8679820400": {"Name": "Fukami M.", "AuthorID": "8679820400", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Endocrinology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "55522306900": {"Name": "Takasawa K.", "AuthorID": "55522306900", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU)"}, "6507268504": {"Name": "Kashimada K.", "AuthorID": "6507268504", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU)"}, "57218800407": {"Name": "Hakoda A.", "AuthorID": "57218800407", "AffiliationID": "60081235", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Miyagi Children's Hospital"}, "34569817200": {"Name": "Kanno J.", "AuthorID": "34569817200", "AffiliationID": "60081235", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Miyagi Children's Hospital"}, "57200592455": {"Name": "Takada S.", "AuthorID": "57200592455", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "37025484400": {"Name": "Baba T.", "AuthorID": "37025484400", "AffiliationID": "60185923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University"}, "35425637800": {"Name": "Morohashi K.I.", "AuthorID": "35425637800", "AffiliationID": "60185923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University"}, "35430643500": {"Name": "Tajima T.", "AuthorID": "35430643500", "AffiliationID": "60028949", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University School of Medicine"}, "55726787600": {"Name": "Hata K.", "AuthorID": "55726787600", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "7101927819": {"Name": "Nakabayashi K.", "AuthorID": "7101927819", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "7202292581": {"Name": "Matsubara Y.", "AuthorID": "7202292581", "AffiliationID": "60017373", "AffiliationName": "National Research Institute for Child Health and Development"}, "6602972748": {"Name": "Sekido R.", "AuthorID": "6602972748", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen"}}}
