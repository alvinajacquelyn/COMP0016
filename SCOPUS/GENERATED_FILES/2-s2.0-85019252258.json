Diabetic Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Diabetes UK.Aim: Higher haemoglobin levels and differences in glucose metabolism have been reported among high-altitude residents, which may influence the diagnostic performance of HbA1c. This study explores the relationship between HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in populations living at sea level and at an altitude of > 3000 m. Methods: Data from 3613 Peruvian adults without a known diagnosis of diabetes from sea-level and high-altitude settings were evaluated. Linear, quadratic and cubic regression models were performed adjusting for potential confounders. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and concordance between HbA1c and FPG was assessed using a Kappa index. Results: At sea level and high altitude, means were 13.5 and 16.7 g/dl (P > 0.05) for haemoglobin level; 41 and 40 mmol/mol (5.9% and 5.8%; P < 0.01) for HbA1c; and 5.8 and 5.1 mmol/l (105 and 91.3 mg/dl; P < 0.001) for FPG, respectively. The adjusted relationship between HbA1c and FPG was quadratic at sea level and linear at high altitude. Adjusted models showed that, to predict an HbA1c value of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), the corresponding mean FPG values at sea level and high altitude were 6.6 and 14.8 mmol/l (120 and 266 mg/dl), respectively. An HbA1c cut-off of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) had a sensitivity for high FPG of 87.3% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 76.5 to 94.4) at sea level and 40.9% (95% CI 20.7 to 63.6) at high altitude. Conclusion: The relationship between HbA1c and FPG is less clear at high altitude than at sea level. Caution is warranted when using HbA1c to diagnose diabetes mellitus in this setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Altitude", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Fasting", "Female", "Geography", "Glucose Tolerance Test", "Glycated Hemoglobin A", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peru"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019252258", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57188860648": {"Name": "Bazo-Alvarez J.C.", "AuthorID": "57188860648", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": "CRONICAS Centre of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}, "55599089700": {"Name": "Quispe R.", "AuthorID": "55599089700", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": "CRONICAS Centre of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}, "55059354600": {"Name": "Pillay T.D.", "AuthorID": "55059354600", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "24075217600": {"Name": "Bernab\u00e9-Ortiz A.", "AuthorID": "24075217600", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": "CRONICAS Centre of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6701518328": {"Name": "Checkley W.", "AuthorID": "6701518328", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Johns Hopkins University"}, "57202677769": {"Name": "Gilman R.H.", "AuthorID": "57202677769", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "56481406300": {"Name": "M\u00e1laga G.", "AuthorID": "56481406300", "AffiliationID": "60071237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}, "24465295500": {"Name": "Miranda J.J.", "AuthorID": "24465295500", "AffiliationID": "60071237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}}}
