Published by Taylor & Francis.Objective: The role of social relationships in determining well-being may be particularly salient in ageing populations. There is only limited longitudinal research examining the relationship between different dimensions of social relationships and change in well-being over time. The present analysis explores the association between isolation, loneliness and two measures of subjective well-being over six years using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Design: Measures of social relationships were obtained at baseline and associations with well-being over the following six years were analysed using mixed models. Main outcome measures: Hedonic and evaluative well-being assessed every two years over the six-year period. Results: Levels of well-being showed a U-shaped relationship with time. At baseline, higher isolation and loneliness were associated with lower levels of hedonic and evaluative well-being. Individuals with high levels of isolation and loneliness initially showed a smaller decrease in evaluative well-being. The subsequent rise in well-being was, however, also diminished in this group. In contrast, loneliness was not associated with rate of change in hedonic well-being, while high levels of isolation were associated with a sustained decrease in hedonic well-being. Conclusion: Social isolation and loneliness show different associations with changes in evaluative and hedonic well-being over time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ELSA", "loneliness", "older adults", "social isolation", "subjective well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Loneliness", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Personal Satisfaction", "Social Isolation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927787117", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"16029356900": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "16029356900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "15848781400": {"Name": "Rafnsson S.", "AuthorID": "15848781400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
