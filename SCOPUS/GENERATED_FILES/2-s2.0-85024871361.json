Dizziness is a substantial cause of morbidity, loss of time from work, repeated medical attendances and costly investigation - one study showed that on average more than four physicians were visited before precise diagnosis of a vestibular problem. The chapter presents the vestibular investigations, clinical disorders, and management of vestibular disorders. Direct observation of eye movements is useful, while recording techniques such as electronystagmography, video-oculography (VOG) and spiral coil recordings allow detailed evaluation and provide a permanent record for comparative purposes. Acute unilateral loss of vestibular function gives rise to symptoms of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, sweating, pallor and diarrhea. The chapter also discusses anatomy, physiology, definitions, introduction and basic concepts for hearing disorders. It describes the clinical examination of the ear and hearing, audiological investigations, auditory processing disorders, management of auditory disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory disorders", "Dizziness", "Electronystagmography", "Hearing", "Neuro-otological assessment", "Video-oculography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024871361", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7404392950": {"Name": "Davies R.", "AuthorID": "7404392950", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006701361": {"Name": "Luxon L.M.", "AuthorID": "7006701361", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7103163120": {"Name": "Bronstein A.", "AuthorID": "7103163120", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
