In the form of Antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), this approach has shown feasibility in the clinic. Areascovered: Although numerous enzyme prodrug combinations have been reported over the last two decades, only the CPG2 ADEPT system has progressed to clinical trials. Using readily available components such as chemical antibody enzyme conjugate or recombinant multifunctional fusion protein, delivery of a specific enzyme to tumours, its elimination from non-tumour sites and prodrug activation has been achieved with therapeutic benefit in the clinic. The challenge here is to overcome immunogenicity of CPG2. Technology exists to overcome this limitation together with prospects for rational design of combined therapy. Expertopinion: ADEPT has the potential to be an effective treatment for solid cancer. However, the system necessitates a multi-disciplinary and iterative approach. Although xenograft studies provide a consistent guide it is only through clinical studies that the real challenges can be identified. The emerging preclinical data with other enzyme prodrug systems may provide the opportunity to develop the next generation ADEPT comprising non-immunogenic enzymes to generate potent cytotoxic drugs within tumours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADEPT", "cancer", "combination therapy", "enzyme", "prodrug"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Humans", "Immunoconjugates", "Immunotherapy", "Neoplasms", "Prodrugs", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002727744", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"56818236300": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "56818236300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7103034036": {"Name": "Bagshawe K.", "AuthorID": "7103034036", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Imperial College London"}}}
