Infant and Child Development Published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdFor parents, online platforms where their children interact with others often feel like a \u201cblack box\u201d in terms of what exactly is happening. In this study, we developed an ecologically valid online computer game in which a (computer-generated) peer teammate tried to provoke frustration, in order to examine (a) adolescents' responses and (b) how indices of self-evaluation (i.e., sense of coherence and self-esteem) and demographic variables (i.e., gender and ethnicity) matter to these responses. Like gender, being a member of a minority or majority group may influence how provocations by peers are interpreted, influencing how one responds. Fifteen-year-old Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents (N = 167) completed self-reports and played the online computer game. The game indeed elicited frustration, with increased self-reported anger. Moreover, expressions of displeasure were much more common during and after provocation than before provocation. Crucially, perceived self-evaluation mattered; higher levels of sense of coherence but lower levels of self-esteem (only in Moroccan-Dutch group) contributed to fewer expressions of displeasure. Gender did not play a moderating role. Our findings provide initial insights into individual differences in adolescents' responses in an online peer-conflict situation. Highlights: We studied Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' responses during online peer provocation and how self-evaluation and demographic variables matter. Provocation by the (computer-generated) peer teammate increased expressions of displeasure. More sense of coherence but less self-esteem was associated with fewer expressions of displeasure, but ethnicity moderated the effect with self-esteem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggression", "cyber bullying", "emotion", "self-esteem", "sense of coherence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034762389", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"26323750200": {"Name": "Novin S.", "AuthorID": "26323750200", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University"}, "54987757200": {"Name": "Bos M.", "AuthorID": "54987757200", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University"}, "7102157430": {"Name": "Stevenson C.", "AuthorID": "7102157430", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "6603039339": {"Name": "Rieffe C.", "AuthorID": "6603039339", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
