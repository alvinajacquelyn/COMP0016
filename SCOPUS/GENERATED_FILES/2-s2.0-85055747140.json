However, most studies are focused on the role of MZ in specific disorders. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between MZ and mental health as a trans-diagnostic process. A sample of 172 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old (M = 14.6, SD = 1.7; 56.4% of girls) was assessed on measures of MZ, psychopathology and psychological functioning from a multimethod and multi-informant perspective. Contrary to predictions, MZ was not associated with general psychopathology and comorbidity, even when explored from a broad, trans-diagnostic perspective. However, we observed a robust association linking MZ to functioning and well-being across many dimensions, involving social, role and several psychological indicators of adjustment and mental health. These results suggest that MZ may contribute to mental health beyond symptoms, not so much associated with psychopathology, but rather resilience and well-being.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjustment", "Analytic function", "Awareness", "Comorbidity", "Consciousness", "Emotional intelligence", "Impairment", "Insight", "Inter-personal intelligence", "Intra-personal intelligence", "Mental disorder", "Mentalizing", "Meta-cognition", "Mindblindness", "Psychopathology", "Reflective function", "Social cognition", "Social intelligence", "Theory of mind", "Tom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child Welfare", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Mentalization", "Psychopathology", "Resilience, Psychological", "Self Concept", "Social Adjustment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055747140", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"6506552670": {"Name": "Ballesp\u00ed S.", "AuthorID": "6506552670", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Helath Psychology, Universitat aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "6507516897": {"Name": "Barrantes-Vidal N.", "AuthorID": "6507516897", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Research Network on Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "14625711500": {"Name": "Vives J.", "AuthorID": "14625711500", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychobiology and Methodology of Health Sciences, Universitat aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "8724552100": {"Name": "Debban\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "8724552100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "13003363700": {"Name": "Sharp C.", "AuthorID": "13003363700", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Houston"}}}
