Also, transfer of CO2 from carbonated water into live oil can liberate light components of the oil, which would create gas phase in-situ. In this investigation, a novel methodology was developed to numerically simulate these complex processes in an integrated approach. This study could present one step closer to realistic evaluations of dynamic CO2 transfer from carbonated water to resident oil and consequent interactions with the reactive minerals in a carbonate reservoir. Taking account of the data of coreflood experiments performed on a carbonate rock under 3100 psi and 100 \u00b0C, profiles of ionic concentration of produced brine and rock weight during carbonated water injection into a dry core (in the absence of oil) were history-matched to tune reaction parameters. Calcite reaction parameters (surface area and activation energy) were tuned to match profile of concentration of Ca++. Also, for additional oil recovery and dP profiles, secondary and tertiary carbonated water injection experiments were matched simultaneously to obtain relative permeability curves and CO2 mass transfer parameters. This new approach is called co-history-matching. Using the tuned parameters in a radial sector model, a series of simulations was performed to analyse change in rock porosity and enhanced oil recovery for large scales for carbonated water injection. Results of the large-scale model have demonstrated that minerals dissolution takes place mostly in vicinity of the injection wellbore. However, the simulation results demonstrated that injection of short cycle of carbonated water followed by plain water would alleviate the dissolution issue, while significant additional oil recovery is achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcite geochemistry", "Carbonated water injection rock dissolution", "CO2 WAG", "Enhanced oil recovery", "Numerical modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 WAG", "Coreflood experiments", "Enhanced oil recovery", "Integrated evaluation", "Mass transfer parameters", "Realistic evaluations", "Relative permeability curves", "Rock dissolution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067849423", "SubjectAreas": [["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"56316281400": {"Name": "Mahzari P.", "AuthorID": "56316281400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57194246995": {"Name": "Jones A.P.", "AuthorID": "57194246995", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57195018773": {"Name": "Oelkers E.H.", "AuthorID": "57195018773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
