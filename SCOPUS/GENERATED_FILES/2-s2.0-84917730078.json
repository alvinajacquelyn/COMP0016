Methods: For a group of 49 children undergoing assessment for potential Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery, CMCT was derived from the latency of MEPs invoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex and from peripheral conduction times. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was used to compare Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) metrics between children with normal and abnormal CMCT. TBSS was also used to look for correlations between these metrics and CMCT across the group. Results: Median age at assessment was 9. years (range 3-19. years). For 14/49 children a diagnosis of primary dystonia had been made. No correlation could be found between DTI metrics and CMCT, with no difference in metrics found between children with normal and abnormal CMCT. Conclusions: DTI metrics did not differ between children with normal and abnormal CMCT. Tissue properties determining CMCT may not be explained by existing DTI metrics. Significance: DTI and CMCT measurements provide complementary information for the clinical assessment of children with complex motor disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central Motor Conduction Time", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Dystonia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Dystonic Disorders", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Neural Conduction", "Reaction Time", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84917730078", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"20435843700": {"Name": "Lumsden D.E.", "AuthorID": "20435843700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute, King's College London"}, "50461740800": {"Name": "Lin J.P.", "AuthorID": "50461740800", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Complex Motor Disorder Service, Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506847364": {"Name": "Charles-Edwards G.", "AuthorID": "6506847364", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9735062100": {"Name": "McClelland V.", "AuthorID": "9735062100", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202875294": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875294", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216028733": {"Name": "Ashmore J.", "AuthorID": "57216028733", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
