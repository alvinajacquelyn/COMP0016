Both matched uncertainties in the isolated subsystems and mismatched uncertainties associated with the interconnections are considered. Under mild conditions, sliding mode controllers for each subsystem are designed in a decentralized manner by only employing local information. Conditions are determined which enable information on the interconnections to be employed within the decentralized controller design to reduce conservatism. The developed results are applied to an automated highway system. Simulation results pertaining to a high-speed following system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated highway systems", "decentralized control", "nonlinear interconnected systems", "sliding mode techniques"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decentralized controller design", "High Speed", "Local information", "Mismatched uncertainty", "Nonlinear interconnected systems", "Nonlinear sliding mode", "Sliding mode controller", "Sliding mode techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044501313", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"56819715300": {"Name": "Mu J.", "AuthorID": "56819715300", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "China University of Petroleum"}, "23112052400": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "23112052400", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}}}
