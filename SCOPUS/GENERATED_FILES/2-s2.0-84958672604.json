Prosthodontics", "Volume": "26", "Issue": 6, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 537, "PageEnd": 544, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1111/jopr.12440", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958672604&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 by the American College of ProsthodontistsPurpose: To examine the changes in Locator attachments after exposure to different water temperatures and cyclic loading. Materials and Methods: Four groups of pink Locator attachments (3.0 lb. light retention replacement patrix attachments; 10 per group) were soaked for the equivalent of 5 years of use in distilled water at the following temperatures: 20\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C. One group was kept dry to test the effect of water. A universal testing machine was used to measure the retention force of each treated attachment during 5500 insertion and removal cycles, simulating approximately 5 years of use. The results were compared using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks. Surface changes of tested attachments were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The exposure to 60\u00b0C water significantly increased the percentage of retention loss in Locator attachments (p < 0.05) compared to the 20\u00b0C water group and significantly reduced the final retention force compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). SEM examinations revealed severe cracking and material degradation in Locator attachments after exposure to 60\u00b0C water and cyclic loading, which were not evident in other groups. Cracking was observed after exposure to 60\u02daC water before cyclic loading. Conclusions: Exposure to 60\u00b0C water, potentially similar to denture cleansing procedures, could cause cracking in Locator attachments. Cracking is associated with hydrolytic degradation of nylon at 60\u00b0C. The change in structure could result in a significant loss of retention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dental implants", "Locator attachment", "overdenture attachment", "overdentures", "retention", "water temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dental Stress Analysis", "Denture Cleansers", "Denture Retention", "Denture, Overlay", "Materials Testing", "Temperature", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958672604", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57126822100": {"Name": "Chiu L.", "AuthorID": "57126822100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Prosthodontics Unit, Department of Restorative Dentistry, UCL, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "33068505400": {"Name": "Vitale N.", "AuthorID": "33068505400", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Prosthodontics Unit, Department of Restorative Dentistry, UCL, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6602244656": {"Name": "Petridis H.", "AuthorID": "6602244656", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Prosthodontics Unit, Department of Restorative Dentistry, UCL, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55413384500": {"Name": "McDonald A.", "AuthorID": "55413384500", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Prosthodontics Unit, Department of Restorative Dentistry, UCL, Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
