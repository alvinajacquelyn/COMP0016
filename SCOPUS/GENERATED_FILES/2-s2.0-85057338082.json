Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Immunoglobulins are biomolecules involved in defence against foreign substances. Flexibility is key to their functional properties in relation to antigen binding and receptor interactions. We have developed an integrative strategy combining ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) with molecular modelling to study the conformational dynamics of human IgG antibodies. Predictive models of all four human IgG subclasses were assembled and their dynamics sampled in the transition from extended to collapsed state during IM-MS. Our data imply that this collapse of IgG antibodies is related to their intrinsic structural features, including Fab arm flexibility, collapse towards the Fc region, and the length of their hinge regions. The workflow presented here provides an accurate structural representation in good agreement with the observed collision cross section for these flexible IgG molecules. These results have implications for studying other nonglobular flexible proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conformation analysis", "immunoglobulin", "ion mobility", "mass spectrometry", "molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collision cross sections", "Conformation analysis", "Conformational dynamics", "Functional properties", "immunoglobulin", "Ion Mobility", "Ion mobility-mass spectrometry", "Structural representation", "Gases", "Immunoglobulin G", "Mass Spectrometry", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057338082", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57204540536": {"Name": "Hansen K.", "AuthorID": "57204540536", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "57075745700": {"Name": "Lau A.M.", "AuthorID": "57075745700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "35097785800": {"Name": "Politis A.", "AuthorID": "35097785800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "7004344321": {"Name": "Giles K.", "AuthorID": "7004344321", "AffiliationID": "60016167", "AffiliationName": "Waters Corp."}, "7101838569": {"Name": "McDonnell J.M.", "AuthorID": "7101838569", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "7102842857": {"Name": "Sutton B.J.", "AuthorID": "7102842857", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "57204958185": {"Name": "Struwe W.B.", "AuthorID": "57204958185", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
