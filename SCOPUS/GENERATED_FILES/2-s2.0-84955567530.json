Material and methods: The predictive value of the different volumes on overall survival (OS) was analyzed retrospectively in patients with intermediate Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk profile and \u22643 International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) factors, who received sunitinib in our institute. Tumor volumes were calculated on segmented computed tomography using in-house developed software. A multivariate analysis was performed including number of metastatic sites and baseline tumor burden (TB). Results: A total of 68 patients were included. Median OS for patients without cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) was 6 months (95% CI: 3.0-8.9 mo) vs. 31 months (95% CI: 23.1-38.8 mo) for those with CN, respectively. More second-line treatment was given after CN (49% vs. 17%, P = 0.125). There was no correlation between tumor volume and TB measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Of all included clinical and volumetric parameters, remaining volume after CN, CN status and 2 vs. 3 IMDC factors were significantly correlated with OS. In the Cox regression analysis, CN was the only remaining significant parameter (P = 0.003). Conclusions: None of the baseline volumetric parameters is an independent prognostic factor in patients with intermediate MSKCC risk mRCC with\u22643 IMDC factors receiving sunitinib. Only CN status correlated significantly with prognosis. None of the baseline volumes nor TB by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was associated with CN status, suggesting that extent of disease had no significant influence on the decision to perform surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metastasis", "MSKCC", "Renal cell carcinoma", "Survival", "Volume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Female", "Humans", "Indoles", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Prognosis", "Pyrroles", "Retrospective Studies", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955567530", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55005756000": {"Name": "de Bruijn R.", "AuthorID": "55005756000", "AffiliationID": "60070176", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Sint Lucas Andreas Hospital"}, "23061630200": {"Name": "Nijkamp J.", "AuthorID": "23061630200", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "55975782300": {"Name": "Noe A.", "AuthorID": "55975782300", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Sint Antonius Hospital"}, "8889252000": {"Name": "Horenblas S.", "AuthorID": "8889252000", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7003526080": {"Name": "Haanen J.", "AuthorID": "7003526080", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute Amsterdam"}, "6507944344": {"Name": "Prevoo W.", "AuthorID": "6507944344", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}}}
