Children showed the classic garden-path effect in online processing. Their reading was disrupted following disambiguation, relative to control sentences containing a comma to block the ambiguity, although the disruption occurred somewhat later than would be expected for mature readers. We also asked children questions to probe their comprehension of the syntactic ambiguity offline. They made more errors following ambiguous sentences than following control sentences, demonstrating that the initial incorrect parse of the garden-path sentence influenced offline comprehension. These findings are consistent with \u201cgood enough\u201d processing effects seen in adults. While faster reading times and more regressions were generally associated with better comprehension, spending longer reading the question predicted comprehension success specifically in the ambiguous condition. This suggests that reading the question prompted children to reconstruct the sentence and engage in some form of processing, which in turn increased the likelihood of comprehension success. Older children were more sensitive to the syntactic function of commas, and, overall, they were faster and more accurate than younger children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children's sentence processing", "Eye movements", "Good enough sentence processing", "Reading development", "Reanalysis", "Syntactic ambiguity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Child", "Child Development", "Comprehension", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Online Systems", "Reading", "Semantics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961218331", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"23037837300": {"Name": "Wonnacott E.", "AuthorID": "23037837300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "14522449800": {"Name": "Joseph H.", "AuthorID": "14522449800", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Social Work and Public Health, Oxford Brookes University"}, "14619068000": {"Name": "Adelman J.", "AuthorID": "14619068000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Warwick"}, "6603727007": {"Name": "Nation K.", "AuthorID": "6603727007", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
