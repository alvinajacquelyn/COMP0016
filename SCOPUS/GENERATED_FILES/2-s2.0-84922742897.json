Using analytical (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) and ab initio modeling, we have investigated Mg2+ insertion and extraction mechanisms and transformation processes in \u03b2-SnSb nanoparticles (NPs), a promising Mg-alloying anode material. During the first several charge-discharge cycles (conditioning), the \u03b2-SnSb particles irreversibly transform into a porous network of pure-Sn and Sb-rich subparticles, as Mg ions replace Sn atoms in the SnSb lattice. After electrochemical conditioning, small Sn particles/grains (<33 \u00b1 20 nm) exhibit highly reversible Mg-storage, while the Sb-rich domains suffer substantial Mg trapping and contribute little to the system performance. This result strongly indicates that pure Sn can act as a high-capacity Mg-insertion anode as theoretically predicted,8 but that its performance is strongly size-dependent, and stable nanoscale Sn morphologies (<40 nm) are needed for superior, reversible Mg-storage and fast system kinetics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ion-insertion anode", "Mg-ion battery", "multivalent battery", "nanostructured Sn", "SnSb nanoparticles", "STEM EDS", "transformation anode"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative anode materials", "Charge-discharge cycle", "Electrochemical conditioning", "Ion batteries", "Ion insertion", "multivalent battery", "Nano-structured", "Transformation process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922742897", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55201230200": {"Name": "Parent L.", "AuthorID": "55201230200", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Fundamental and Computational Sciences Direct., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "26643449500": {"Name": "Browning N.", "AuthorID": "26643449500", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Fundamental and Computational Sciences Direct., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "57209290059": {"Name": "Cheng Y.", "AuthorID": "57209290059", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Energy Processes and Materials Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "6603675533": {"Name": "Sushko P.", "AuthorID": "6603675533", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Fundamental and Computational Science Direct., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "13405871300": {"Name": "Shao Y.", "AuthorID": "13405871300", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Energy Processes and Materials Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "56407047400": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "56407047400", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Energy Processes and Materials Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "55090146900": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "55090146900", "AffiliationID": "60015103, 60023471", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}}}
