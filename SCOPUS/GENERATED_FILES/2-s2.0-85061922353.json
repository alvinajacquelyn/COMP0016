Self-help interventions can increase such access. The aim of this paper was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of guided and unguided self-help for children and young people with symptoms of common mental health disorders. In contrast to previous reviews of self-help in children, all types of self-help and multiple mental health disorders were investigated in order to increase power to investigate potential moderators of efficacy. Importantly, studies with control arms as well as those comparing against traditional face-to-face treatments were included. Fifty studies (n = 3396 participants in self-help/guided self-help conditions) met the inclusion criteria. Results demonstrated a moderate positive effect size for guided and unguided self-help interventions when compared against a control group (n = 44; g = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.61, p <.01) and a small but significant negative effect size when compared to other therapies (n = 15; g = \u22120.17; 95% CI: \u20130.27 to \u20130.07, p <.01). Few potential moderators had a significant effect on outcome. Most comparisons resulted in significant heterogeneity and therefore results are interpreted with caution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "anxiety", "children", "depression", "disruptive behaviour", "Self-help"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Self Care", "Self-Management"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061922353", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36968589700": {"Name": "Bennett S.D.", "AuthorID": "36968589700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57200655474": {"Name": "McKenzie Smith M.", "AuthorID": "57200655474", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "25958950300": {"Name": "Coughtrey A.E.", "AuthorID": "25958950300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55623201600": {"Name": "Manzotti G.", "AuthorID": "55623201600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7005376994": {"Name": "Cuijpers P.", "AuthorID": "7005376994", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "42061325600": {"Name": "Ebert D.D.", "AuthorID": "42061325600", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen Nurnberg"}}}
