Images were displayed on a standard monitor (Barco Coronis 5MP mammo) and an advanced monitor (Barco Coronis Uniti 12MP MDMC-12132). Ill-defined margin and spiculated mass models were inserted into mammographic regions of interest using a validated physics-based insertion framework. Experiments were conducted for mass size of 8\u201311mm to 2\u20133mm and density of 100% to 70% of glandular tissue with 142 trials per condition. Five medical physicists read the dataset on both monitors. Percentage correct (PC) of detected masses for average observer and 95% confidence intervals were determined. Paired t-test and ANOVA analysis were performed. The observers had significantly better detection rates when the dataset was read on the advanced monitor compared to the standard monitor (3% increase in overall PC, paired p-value=0.0076).", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D digital mammography", "4AFC observer study", "Clinical display", "Detection", "DLA mass", "Simulated lesions", "Spiculated mass", "Virtual clinical trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical trial", "Digital mammography", "DLA mass", "Observer studies", "Simulated lesions", "Spiculated mass"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977589482", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55201317000": {"Name": "Rashidnasab A.", "AuthorID": "55201317000", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "56258145400": {"Name": "Bemelmans F.", "AuthorID": "56258145400", "AffiliationID": "60121202, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven"}, "57201814910": {"Name": "Bosmans H.", "AuthorID": "57201814910", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UZ Leuven"}, "7102431131": {"Name": "Marshall N.W.", "AuthorID": "7102431131", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UZ Leuven"}, "57203007659": {"Name": "Kimpe T.", "AuthorID": "57203007659", "AffiliationID": "60082485", "AffiliationName": "Barco"}}}
