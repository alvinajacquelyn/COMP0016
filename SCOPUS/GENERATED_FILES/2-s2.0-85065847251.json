Sixty-one mothers who were experiencing mental health difficulties and who were receiving PIP with their young infants participated in the study. A mixed-methodology was used to examine participants\u2019 expectations through transformation content analysis of pretreatment interviews; recurring themes were classified and quantified. Further statistical analyses explored relationships between the quantified themes of parental expectations and clinical outcomes and engagement in treatment. No significant correlation was found between expectations and engagement. One of the six clinical outcomes significantly correlated with parental expectations. Improved reflective functioning (RF) was predicted by participants describing expectations of wanting to improve their parent\u2013infant relationship through the treatment, and expressing concerns about discussing their past experiences. These two expectations predicted improvements in RF independently and when combined. These results indicate that PIP may be more effective for some mothers than others and that assessing future clients\u2019 expectations before beginning PIP may be beneficial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attachment-based intervention", "Attentes", "bindungsbasierte Intervention", "early intervention", "Eltern-Kind-Psychotherapie", "engagement", "Engagement", "Engagement", "Erwartungen", "expectations", "expectativas", "Fr\u00fchintervention", "intervenci\u00f3n basada en la afectividad", "intervenci\u00f3n temprana", "Intervention Bas\u00e9e sur l'Attachement", "Intervention pr\u00e9coce", "Parent\u2013Infant Psychotherapy", "participaci\u00f3n", "Psychoth\u00e9rapie Parent\u2013Nourrisson", "Sicoterapia Progenitor-Infante"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mother-Child Relations", "Mothers", "Patient Satisfaction", "Psychotherapy", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065847251", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57208801684": {"Name": "Ransley R.", "AuthorID": "57208801684", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "12761729700": {"Name": "Sleed M.", "AuthorID": "12761729700", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Attachment and Psychological Therapies Research Unit (ChAPTRe), The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "6507314150": {"Name": "Baradon T.", "AuthorID": "6507314150", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Human and Community Development, University of Witwatersrand"}}}
