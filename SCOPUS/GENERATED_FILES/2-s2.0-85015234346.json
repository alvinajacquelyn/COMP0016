Then, the communication channel models constructed by information theory are briefly introduced. Meanwhile, the channel capacity, as a key role in modeling a channel, is expatiated. In addition, source coding and channel coding are compared and explained with a number of simulations. By reading this paper, the readers are expected to understand the significance of information theory as well as the indispensable roles of source coding and channel coding in a communication system. Furthermore, most of the techniques and fundamentals introduced and analyzed in this paper are feasible for the big data analytics in cyber-physical systems, which pave the way for coding over these newborn systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["channel capacity", "Channel coding", "information theory", "source coding", "Tutorial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data analytics", "Digital communications", "Source-coding", "Tutorial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015234346", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57006170100": {"Name": "Sheng G.", "AuthorID": "57006170100", "AffiliationID": "112797601", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Post and Telecommunication College"}, "57193616581": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57193616581", "AffiliationID": "112797601", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Post and Telecommunication College"}, "57193602624": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "57193602624", "AffiliationID": "101128014", "AffiliationName": "Shenyang Polytechnic College"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57199094588": {"Name": "Song H.", "AuthorID": "57199094588", "AffiliationID": "60014723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Virginia University Institute of Technology"}}}
