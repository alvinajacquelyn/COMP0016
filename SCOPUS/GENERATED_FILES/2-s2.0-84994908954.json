We hypothesized that measurement of neurofilament light protein (NF-L), a protein found in long white-matter axons, in blood samples, may serve as a suitable biomarker for neuronal damage in TBI patients. To test our hypotheses, we designed a study in two parts: i) we developed an immunoassay based on Single molecule array technology for quantification of NF-L in blood, and ii) in a proof-of-concept study, we tested our newly developed method on serial serum samples from severe TBI (sTBI) patients (n = 72) and controls (n = 35). We also compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility of NF-L with the established blood biomarker S100B. NF-L levels were markedly increased in sTBI patients compared with controls. NF-L at admission yielded an AUC of 0.99 to detect TBI versus controls (AUC 0.96 for S100B), and increased to 1.00 at day 12 (0.65 for S100B). Importantly, initial NF-L levels predicted poor 12-month clinical outcome. In contrast, S100B was not related to outcome. Taken together, our data suggests that measurement of serum NF-L may be useful to assess the severity of neuronal injury following sTBI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Area Under Curve", "Axons", "Biomarkers", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Case-Control Studies", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neurons", "Prognosis", "Reproducibility of Results", "S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994908954", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55366129900": {"Name": "Shahim P.", "AuthorID": "55366129900", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "57190304325": {"Name": "Gren M.", "AuthorID": "57190304325", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "56601439500": {"Name": "Liman V.", "AuthorID": "56601439500", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6507640983": {"Name": "Norgren N.", "AuthorID": "6507640983", "AffiliationID": "60112896", "AffiliationName": "UmanDiagnostics"}, "56079025700": {"Name": "Tegner Y.", "AuthorID": "56079025700", "AffiliationID": "60007183", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Sciences, Department of Health Sciences, Lulea University of Technology"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Lund University"}, "7102011511": {"Name": "Andreasen N.", "AuthorID": "7102011511", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of NVS, Karolinska Institute, Center for Alzheimer Research"}, "10040031500": {"Name": "\u00d6st M.", "AuthorID": "10040031500", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Gothenburg University"}, "6603024325": {"Name": "Nellg\u00e5rd B.", "AuthorID": "6603024325", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Gothenburg University"}}}
