EDO should, therefore, be considered within the list of differential diagnoses for men undergoing infertility investigations, with work up including clinical examination, transurethral ultrasonography, semen analysis, chromotubation, seminal vesiculography and seminal vesicle aspiration. Obstruction can be limited to the distal ends of the ducts or it can extend proximally to include the terminal portions of the vasa deferentia, with the site and length of the obstruction having implications for surgical intervention. Early endoscopic treatment can reverse symptoms and prevent the progression of partial obstruction to bilateral, complete obstruction, and transurethral resection of the ejaculatory duct remains the main treatment option for EDO. Alternative treatment options include endoscopic laser-assisted resection of the ducts, antegrade seminal-vesicle lavage to relieve EDO secondary to inspissated material or calculi, or dilatation of the ejaculatory ducts using 9F seminal vesicoscopy or balloon.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Management", "Ejaculatory Ducts", "Humans", "Infertility, Male", "Male", "Semen Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953347657", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"36628980200": {"Name": "Modgil V.", "AuthorID": "36628980200", "AffiliationID": "60013719, 60006687", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, Alexandra Hospital"}, "56988576500": {"Name": "Rai S.", "AuthorID": "56988576500", "AffiliationID": "60003617", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Harrogate District Hospital"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.J.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, University College London Hospital"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, University College London Hospital"}}}
