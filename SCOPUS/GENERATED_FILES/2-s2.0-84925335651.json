Materials and Methods In 20 healthy volunteers RAGS ( ~6 sec breath-hold) and respiratory-navigated cine ( ~5 min) PCMR were performed in both renal arteries to assess RBF. A simulation of RAGS PCMR was used to assess the effect of heart rate (30-105 bpm), vessel expandability (0-150%) and translational motion (x1.0-4.0) on the accuracy of RBF measurements. Results There was good agreement between RAGS and cine PCMR in the volunteer study (bias: 0.01 L/min, limits of agreement: -0.04 to +0.06 L/min, P = 0.0001). The simulation demonstrated a positive linear relationship between heart rate and error (r = 0.9894, P < 0.0001), a negative linear relationship between vessel expansion and error (r = -0.9484, P < 0.0001), and a nonlinear, heart rate-dependent relationship between vessel translation and error. Conclusion We have demonstrated that RAGS PCMR accurately measures RBF in vivo. However, the simulation reveals limitations in this technique at extreme heart rates (<40 bpm, >100 bpm), or when there is significant motion (vessel expandability: >80%, vessel translation: >x2.2).", "AuthorKeywords": ["breath-hold", "fast", "flow", "renal", "spiral"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Breath Holding", "Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renal Artery", "Renal Circulation", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925335651", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.A.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, University College London"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
