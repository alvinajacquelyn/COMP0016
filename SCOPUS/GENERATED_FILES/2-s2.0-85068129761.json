Brittle deformation in RT was initiated with the formation of veins, disrupting low-strain crystal-plastic deformation. Following cooling, shear fractures propagated along these veins with associated fluid influx, leading to phyllic alteration. Hydrolysis converted all plagioclase to kaolinite within the damage zones and all orthoclase to illite within fault cores and the less deformed rocks surrounded by faults. In turn, precipitation of quartz and pyrite locally cemented gouge in the fault cores. Concentration of clays around faults and veins weakened the rocks and promoted shear strain along them. These processes are expected to occur in any porphyry-related hydrothermal system and can combine during the development of the system. Although cementation tends to strengthen fault cores, the overall strength of the faults is expected to be reduced by hydrolysis of plagioclase, reducing the friction of the faults and their capacity to accumulate stress. These findings may have strong implications for understanding the evolution of ore deposit, the rheology of the crust, earthquake generation, and natural hazard assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fault rocks", "Fault-fluid interaction", "Porphyry copper alteration", "Radomiro Tomic deposit"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brittle deformation", "Crystal plastic deformations", "Fault rock", "Fluid interactions", "Hydrothermal fluids", "Hydrothermal system", "Petrographic analysis", "Porphyry coppers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068129761", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"55323506400": {"Name": "Jensen E.", "AuthorID": "55323506400", "AffiliationID": "122769290", "AffiliationName": "EJS Geolog\u00eda E.I.R.L."}, "56013579600": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez G.", "AuthorID": "56013579600", "AffiliationID": "114017974", "AffiliationName": "National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN)"}, "7201970222": {"Name": "Faulkner D.", "AuthorID": "7201970222", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Rock Deformation Laboratory, Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "6602813874": {"Name": "Cembrano J.", "AuthorID": "6602813874", "AffiliationID": "60105875", "AffiliationName": "Andean Geothermal Center of Excellence (CEGA, FONDAP-CONICYT)"}, "39262157300": {"Name": "Mitchell T.", "AuthorID": "39262157300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
