Objective: To assess the effect of bladder catheterization duration after urinary obstetric fistula surgery. Search strategy: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, GIM, and POPLINE databases were searched, without language restrictions, using \u201cobstetric urinary fistula\u201d and \u201ccatheterization\u201d from inception to September 30, 2017. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing shorter versus longer (>10 days) bladder catheterization after urinary obstetric fistula repair were included. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted and meta-analyses were conducted. The GRADE system was used to assess evidence quality. Main results: Two unblinded non-inferiority trials (684 patients combined) were included. There were no differences between shorter and longer bladder catheterization in the risk of fistula repair breakdown either before (relative risk [RR] 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49\u20132.64) or after (RR 1.64; 95% CI 0.81\u20133.31) hospital discharge. Similarly, urinary infection (RR 5.18; 95% CI 0.25\u2013107.44); urinary incontinence before (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.54\u20132.43) or after (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.62\u20132.18) discharge; urinary retention (RR 1.34; 95% CI 0.79\u20132.27); or extended hospital stay (RR 9.33; 95% CI 0.51\u2013172.41) were not associated with duration of catheterization. Evidence quality was low or moderate. Conclusions: Shorter, compared to longer, bladder catheterization duration after urinary obstetric fistula surgery was not associated with significant outcome differences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catheterization", "Obstetric fistula", "Systematic review", "Urinary catheterization", "Vaginal fistula", "Vesicovaginal fistula"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Time Factors", "Urinary Bladder", "Urinary Catheterization", "Urinary Fistula", "Urinary Incontinence", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Urologic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043527502", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7801559948": {"Name": "Torloni M.", "AuthorID": "7801559948", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Evidence Based Health Care Post-Graduate Program, S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University"}, "24780005900": {"Name": "Riera R.", "AuthorID": "24780005900", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Evidence Based Health Care Post-Graduate Program, S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University"}, "55229157600": {"Name": "Rogozi\u0144ska E.", "AuthorID": "55229157600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Multidisciplinary Evidence Synthesis Hub (MESH), Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University London"}, "8834102400": {"Name": "Tun\u00e7alp \u00d6.", "AuthorID": "8834102400", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60016293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Health and Research including UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), World Health Organization"}, "7006645199": {"Name": "G\u00fclmezoglu A.", "AuthorID": "7006645199", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60016293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Health and Research including UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), World Health Organization"}, "15756570400": {"Name": "Widmer M.", "AuthorID": "15756570400", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60016293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Health and Research including UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), World Health Organization"}}}
