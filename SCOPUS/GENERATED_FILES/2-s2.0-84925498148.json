Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory\u2019s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), and Hinode\u2019s EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS) are used to determine the atmospheric response to new flux emerging into a pre-existing active region. Brightenings are seen forming in the upper photosphere, chromosphere, and corona over the EFR location whilst flux cancellation is observed in the photosphere. The impact of the flux emergence is far reaching, with new large-scale coronal loops forming up to 43 Mm from the EFR and coronal upflow enhancements of approximately 10 km s\u22121 on the north side of the EFR. Jets are seen forming in the chromosphere and the corona over the emerging serpentine field. This is the first time that coronal jets have been seen over the serpentine field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925498148", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"51864532000": {"Name": "Shelton D.", "AuthorID": "51864532000", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7004033067": {"Name": "Harra L.", "AuthorID": "7004033067", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7401917508": {"Name": "Green L.", "AuthorID": "7401917508", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}}}
