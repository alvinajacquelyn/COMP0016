Materials and methods: BALB/c mice bearing established transplantable her2+ tumors were treated with a DNA-based antiangiogenic vaccine or with an empty plasmid (untreated group). DCE-MRI was carried out by administering a dose of 0.05mmol/kg of Gadocoletic acid trisodium salt, a Gd-based blood pool contrast agent (CA) at 1T. Changes in pharmacokinetic estimates (K<sup>trans</sup> and v<inf>p</inf>) in a nine-day interval were compared between treated and untreated groups on a voxel-by-voxel analysis. The tumor response to therapy was assessed by a clustering approach and compared with conventional summary statistics, with sub-regions analysis and with histogram analysis. Results: Both the K<sup>trans</sup> and v<inf>p</inf> estimates, following blood-pool CA injection, showed marked and spatial heterogeneous changes with antiangiogenic treatment. Averaged values for the whole tumor region, as well as from the rim/core sub-regions analysis were unable to assess the antiangiogenic response. Histogram analysis resulted in significant changes only in the v<inf>p</inf> estimates (p<0.05). The proposed clustering approach depicted marked changes in both the K<sup>trans</sup> and v<inf>p</inf> estimates, with significant spatial heterogeneity in v<inf>p</inf> maps in response to treatment (p<0.05), provided that DCE-MRI data are properly clustered in three or four sub-regions. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the value of cluster analysis applied to pharmacokinetic DCE-MRI parametric maps for assessing tumor response to antiangiogenic therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiangiogenic", "Clustering", "DCE-MRI", "Gd-complexes", "Pharmacokinetic modeling", "Tumor heterogeneity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Animals", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cluster Analysis", "Contrast Media", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gadolinium", "Image Enhancement", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930927735", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8564616500": {"Name": "Longo D.L.", "AuthorID": "8564616500", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging Center, University of Torino"}, "6603182840": {"Name": "Dastr\u00f9 W.", "AuthorID": "6603182840", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino"}, "55964151500": {"Name": "Consolino L.", "AuthorID": "55964151500", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino"}, "7006357833": {"Name": "Aime S.", "AuthorID": "7006357833", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino"}, "10139199200": {"Name": "Arigoni M.", "AuthorID": "10139199200", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino"}, "34568031100": {"Name": "Cavallo F.", "AuthorID": "34568031100", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino"}, "15065505700": {"Name": "Espak M.", "AuthorID": "15065505700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
