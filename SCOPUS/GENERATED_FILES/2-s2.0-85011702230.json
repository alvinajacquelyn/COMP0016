Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdMany young transplant recipients experience psychological distress and adjustment difficulties, yet there is little research investigating lung transplantation from the recipients\u2019 perspective. This qualitative study aimed to explore experiences of young people who underwent lung transplantation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six lung transplant recipients (aged 15-18). Interviews were analysed using IPA, a qualitative research approach examining how people make sense of their major life experiences. The analysis revealed three master themes: \u201cLiving with Dodgy Lungs\u201d outlined how participants dealt with their experiences, managing through accepting or discussing their feelings with others, although talking was often difficult. \u201cThe Big Deal\u201d reflected participants\u2019 experiences of the process, their expectations, and the contrast of their lives pre- and post-transplant. Inherent in their accounts was the profound meaning ascribed to transplantation, the emotional turmoil, and impact on their lives. \u201cA Sense of Self\u201d illustrated participants\u2019 developing identities within their social contexts and at times isolating experiences. The results highlight key areas where adolescent lung transplant recipients could be supported by clinicians, enabling the promotion of psychological well-being. Examples include supporting identity integration post-transplant, facilitating social inclusion, considering alternative means of support, and involving adolescents in healthcare decisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "lung transplant", "paediatric", "psychosocial", "quality of life", "transplant"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Lung Transplantation", "Male", "Patient Participation", "Patient Satisfaction", "Qualitative Research", "Social Support", "Stress, Psychological", "Transplant Recipients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011702230", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57190376869": {"Name": "Anderson S.M.", "AuthorID": "57190376869", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East London"}, "35614843500": {"Name": "Gannon K.", "AuthorID": "35614843500", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East London"}, "57203081145": {"Name": "Wray J.", "AuthorID": "57203081145", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Transplant Team, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57212773138": {"Name": "Ralph A.", "AuthorID": "57212773138", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Transplant Team, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56637769000": {"Name": "Spencer H.", "AuthorID": "56637769000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Transplant Team, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "16203616400": {"Name": "Lunnon-Wood T.", "AuthorID": "16203616400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Transplant Team, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
