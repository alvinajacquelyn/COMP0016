We recently discovered that the large vertex brain potentials elicited by sudden supramodal stimuli are strongly coupled with a multiphasic modulation of isometric force, a phenomenon that we named cortico-muscular resonance (CMR). Here, we extend our investigation of the CMR to the time-frequency domain. We show that (i)both somatosensory and auditory stimuli evoke a number of phase-locked and non-phase-locked modulations of EEG spectral power. Remarkably, (ii)some of these phase-locked and non-phase-locked modulations are also present in the Force spectral power. Finally, (iii)EEG and Force time-frequency responses are correlated in two distinct regions of the power spectrum. An early, low-frequency region (\u223c4 Hz)reflects the previously-described coupling between the phase-locked EEG vertex potential and force modulations. A late, higher-frequency region (beta-band, \u223c20 Hz)reflects a second coupling between the non-phase-locked increase of power observed in both EEG and Force. In both time-frequency regions, coupling was maximal over the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the hand exerting the force, suggesting an effect of the stimuli on the tonic corticospinal drive. Thus, stimulus-induced CMR occurs across at least two different types of cortical activities, whose functional significance in relation to the motor system should be investigated further. We propose that these different types of corticomuscular coupling are important to alter motor behaviour in response to salient environmental events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory", "Beta oscillations", "Cortico-muscular resonance (CMR)", "EEG", "Force", "Somatosensory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Auditory Perception", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Brain", "Brain Waves", "Female", "Hand", "Humans", "Isometric Contraction", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Physical Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Sensorimotor Cortex", "Touch Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066103305", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"37056031000": {"Name": "Novembre G.", "AuthorID": "37056031000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "35975054700": {"Name": "Kilintari M.", "AuthorID": "35975054700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203395070": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "57203395070", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.D.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "57060570800": {"Name": "Bufacchi R.J.", "AuthorID": "57060570800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "13607280000": {"Name": "Pawar V.M.", "AuthorID": "13607280000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
