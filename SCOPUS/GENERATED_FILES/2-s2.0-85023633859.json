Modelling and understanding human infection is imperative to developing treatments to reduce the global burden of infectious disease. Bioluminescence imaging is a highly sensitive, non-invasive technique based on the detection of light, produced by luciferase-catalysed reactions. In the study of infectious disease, bioluminescence imaging is a well-established technique; it can be used to detect, localize and quantify specific immune cells, pathogens or immunological processes. This enables longitudinal studies in which the spectrum of the disease process and its response to therapies can be monitored. Light producing transgenic rodents are emerging as key tools in the study of host response to infection. Here, we review the strategies for identifying biological processes in vivo, including the technology of bioluminescence imaging and illustrate how this technique is shedding light on the host-pathogen relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioluminescence", "Biosensor", "Gene transfer", "Host-pathogen relationship", "Transcription factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Communicable Diseases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genes, Reporter", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Luciferases", "Luminescent Measurements", "Mice", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023633859", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55959733700": {"Name": "Suff N.", "AuthorID": "55959733700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003698645": {"Name": "Waddington S.", "AuthorID": "7003698645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
