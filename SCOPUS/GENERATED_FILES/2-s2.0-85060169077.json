Here, processing pipelines for seven automated tools that can be used to segment grey matter within the brain are presented. The protocol provides an initial step for researchers aiming to find the most accurate method for generating grey matter volumes from T1-weighted MRI scans. Steps to undertake detailed visual quality control are also included in the manuscript. This protocol covers a range of potential segmentation tools and encourages users to compare the performance of these tools within a subset of their data before selecting one to apply to a full cohort. Furthermore, the protocol may be further generalized to the segmentation of other brain regions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANTs", "Free Surfer", "FSL", "Grey matter", "Issue 143", "MALP-EM", "MRI", "Neuroscience", "Quality control", "SPM", "Structural"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060169077", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57208140593": {"Name": "Johnson E.", "AuthorID": "57208140593", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
