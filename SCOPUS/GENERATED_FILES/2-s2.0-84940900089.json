Objectives: To determine the frequency of overt DIC, according to ISTH criteria, in children with fatal and non-fatal CM. Methods/patients: Malawian children were recruited into a prospective cohort study in the following diagnostic groups: retinopathy-positive CM (n = 140), retinopathy-negative CM (n = 36), non-malarial coma (n = 14), uncomplicated malaria (UM), (n = 91), mild non-malarial febrile illness (n = 85), and healthy controls (n = 36). Assays in the ISTH DIC criteria were performed, and three fibrin-related markers, i.e. protein C, antithrombin, and soluble thrombomodulin, were measured. Results and conclusions: Data enabling assignment of the presence or absence of 'overt DIC' were available for 98 of 140 children with retinopathy-positive CM. Overt DIC was present in 19 (19%), and was associated with a fatal outcome (odds ratio [OR] 3.068; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.085-8.609; P = 0.035]. The levels of the three fibrin-related markers and soluble thrombomodulin were higher in CM patients than in UM patients (all P < 0.001). The mean fibrin degradation product level was higher in fatal CM patients (71.3 \u03bcg mL-1 [95% CI 49.0-93.6]) than in non-fatal CM patients (48.0 \u03bcg mL-1 [95% CI 37.7-58.2]; P = 0.032), but, in multivariate logistic regression, thrombomodulin was the only coagulation-related marker that was independently associated with a fatal outcome (OR 1.084 for each ng mL-1 increase [95% CI 1.017-1.156]; P = 0.014). Despite these laboratory derangements, no child in the study had clinically evident bleeding or thrombosis. An overt DIC score and high thrombomodulin levels are associated with a fatal outcome in CM, but infrequently indicate a consumptive coagulopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood coagulation", "Disseminated intravascular coagulation", "Endothelial cell protein C receptor", "Fibrin", "Malaria, cerebral"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Blood Glucose", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coma", "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation", "Female", "Fever", "Fibrin", "Hematologic Tests", "Humans", "Infant", "Lactates", "Malaria, Cerebral", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Malawi", "Male", "Parasitemia", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Hemorrhage", "Risk Factors", "Thrombomodulin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940900089", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"55309248000": {"Name": "Moxon C.A.", "AuthorID": "55309248000", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7102084448": {"Name": "Toh C.H.", "AuthorID": "7102084448", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Roald Dahl Haemostasis and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "55901795700": {"Name": "Chisala N.V.", "AuthorID": "55901795700", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "16175629900": {"Name": "Maccormick I.", "AuthorID": "16175629900", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7004794512": {"Name": "Molyneux M.", "AuthorID": "7004794512", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "56815046500": {"Name": "Mzikamanda R.", "AuthorID": "56815046500", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7202447700": {"Name": "Harding S.", "AuthorID": "7202447700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Aging and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool"}, "7006420400": {"Name": "Downey C.", "AuthorID": "7006420400", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Roald Dahl Haemostasis and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "36800850500": {"Name": "Seydel K.B.", "AuthorID": "36800850500", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "Blantyre Malaria Project, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "35413137400": {"Name": "Taylor T.E.", "AuthorID": "35413137400", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "Blantyre Malaria Project, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}}}
