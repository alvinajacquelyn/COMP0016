Less is known about whether the strength of the association differs for each outcome, between men and women, or cross-nationally. We investigate this using contemporaneous national probability survey data from Britain and France. Methods: Data were analysed for 17\u201329 year-olds in Britain\u2019s third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3, n = 5959) undertaken 2010\u20132012, and the 2010 French Fertility, Contraception and Sexual Dysfunction survey (FECOND, n = 3027). For each country, we estimated the gender-specific prevalence of sex before-16, contraceptive-use, conception before-20, and abortion in the event of conception, and used logistic regression to examine associations between two measures of socioeconomic status\u2013educational-level and parental socioeconomic-group\u2013and each outcome. We tested for interactions between socioeconomic characteristics and country, and socioeconomic characteristics and gender, for each outcome. Results: For each outcome, Britain and France differed with regard to prevalence but associations with socioeconomic characteristics were similar. Respondents of higher educational level, and, less consistently, with parents from higher socioeconomic-groups, were less likely to report sex before-16 (Britain, men: adjusted OR (aOR) 0.5, women: aOR 0.5; France, men: aOR 0.5, women: aOR 0.5), no contraception at first sex (Britain, men: aOR 0.4, women: aOR 0.6; France, men: aOR 0.4, women: aOR 0.4), pregnancy before-20 (Britain: aOR 0.3; France: aOR 0.1), and in Britain, a birth rather than an abortion in the event of conception (Britain: aOR 3.1). We found no strong evidence of variation in the magnitude of the associations with socioeconomic characteristics by country or gender. Conclusions: Population level differences in conception and abortion rates between the two countries may partly be driven by the larger proportion of the population that is disadvantaged in Britain. This research highlights the role intra-country comparisons can play in understanding young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Abortion, Induced", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Fertilization", "France", "Humans", "Sexual Behavior", "Social Class", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031787492", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189641722": {"Name": "Scott R.", "AuthorID": "57189641722", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6701334125": {"Name": "Slaymaker E.", "AuthorID": "6701334125", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003435463": {"Name": "Bajos N.", "AuthorID": "7003435463", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gender, Health and Sexuality, INSERM"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University College London"}}}
