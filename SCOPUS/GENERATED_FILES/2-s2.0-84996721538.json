The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present kinematic analyses of the 12 galaxies in the \"Survey of H i in Extremely Low-mass Dwarfs\" (SHIELD). We use multi-configuration interferometric observations of the H i 21 cm emission line from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)22 to produce image cubes at a variety of spatial and spectral resolutions. Both two- and three-dimensional fitting techniques are employed in an attempt to derive inclination-corrected rotation curves for each galaxy. In most cases, the comparable magnitudes of velocity dispersion and projected rotation result in degeneracies that prohibit unambiguous circular velocity solutions. We thus make spatially resolved position-velocity cuts, corrected for inclination using the stellar components, to estimate the circular rotation velocities. We find 30 km s-1 for the entire survey population. Baryonic masses are calculated using single-dish H i fluxes from Arecibo and stellar masses derived from HST and Spitzer imaging. Comparison is made with total dynamical masses estimated from the position-velocity analysis. The SHIELD galaxies are then placed on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. There exists an empirical threshold rotational velocity, V < 15 km s-1, below which current observations cannot differentiate coherent rotation from pressure support. The SHIELD galaxies are representative of an important population of galaxies whose properties cannot be described by current models of rotationally dominated galaxy dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: dwarf", "galaxies: irregular", "galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "line: profiles", "radio lines: galaxies", "surveys"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996721538", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57192061729": {"Name": "McNichols A.T.", "AuthorID": "57192061729", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "47561985000": {"Name": "Teich Y.G.", "AuthorID": "47561985000", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Boston University"}, "57192072717": {"Name": "Nims E.", "AuthorID": "57192072717", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "36010455900": {"Name": "Cannon J.M.", "AuthorID": "36010455900", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "55340357300": {"Name": "Cave I.", "AuthorID": "55340357300", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "57192063174": {"Name": "Hagen C.", "AuthorID": "57192063174", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "55339735100": {"Name": "Marshall M.V.", "AuthorID": "55339735100", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "55339738700": {"Name": "Thomann C.M.", "AuthorID": "55339738700", "AffiliationID": "60028787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macalester College"}, "56734531300": {"Name": "Sistine A.V.", "AuthorID": "56734531300", "AffiliationID": "60019909", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee"}, "35748404500": {"Name": "Adams E.A.K.", "AuthorID": "35748404500", "AffiliationID": "60025529", "AffiliationName": "ASTRON, Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy"}, "8502067100": {"Name": "Giovanelli R.", "AuthorID": "8502067100", "AffiliationID": "60009777, 60007776", "AffiliationName": "Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, Space Sciences Building, Cornell University"}, "7102301757": {"Name": "Haynes M.P.", "AuthorID": "7102301757", "AffiliationID": "60009777, 60007776", "AffiliationName": "Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, Space Sciences Building, Cornell University"}, "16304733200": {"Name": "McQuinn K.B.W.", "AuthorID": "16304733200", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Observatory, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7005478307": {"Name": "Skillman E.D.", "AuthorID": "7005478307", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy, S.E., University of Minnesota"}, "34167850000": {"Name": "Janowiecki S.", "AuthorID": "34167850000", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60189099", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, University of Western Australia"}, "7005876995": {"Name": "Salzer J.J.", "AuthorID": "7005876995", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Indiana University"}, "55340277500": {"Name": "Bernstein-Cooper E.Z.", "AuthorID": "55340277500", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Indiana University"}, "7102207664": {"Name": "Dolphin A.", "AuthorID": "7102207664", "AffiliationID": "60005304", "AffiliationName": "Raytheon Company"}, "24757719500": {"Name": "Elson E.C.", "AuthorID": "24757719500", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravity Centre (ACGC), Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town"}, "36617450600": {"Name": "Haurberg N.", "AuthorID": "36617450600", "AffiliationID": "60024298", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Knox College"}, "15834708300": {"Name": "J\u00f3zsa G.I.G.", "AuthorID": "15834708300", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Argelander-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie"}, "55726703800": {"Name": "Ott J.", "AuthorID": "55726703800", "AffiliationID": "60021907", "AffiliationName": "National Radio Astronomy Observatory"}, "12789870200": {"Name": "Saintonge A.", "AuthorID": "12789870200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55439573400": {"Name": "Warren S.R.", "AuthorID": "55439573400", "AffiliationID": "60018407", "AffiliationName": "Cray Inc."}, "52363806100": {"Name": "Huang S.", "AuthorID": "52363806100", "AffiliationID": "60029600, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, New York University"}}}
