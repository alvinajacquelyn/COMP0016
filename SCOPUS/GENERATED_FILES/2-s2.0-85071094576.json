A recently developed and modified time-harmonic numerical solution of Maxwell\u2019s equations is used to obtain scattered far fields for many wave numbers contained in the calculated spectrum. The interferometer setup with its lenses is included rigorously with Fresnel integrals and the Debye-Wolf integral. The implemented model is validated with an existing FDTD algorithm by comparing simulated tomograms of single and multiple cylindrical scatterers for perpendicular and parallel polarisation of the incident light. Tomograms are presented for different realisations of multiple cylindrical scatterers. Furthermore, simulated tomograms of a ziggurat-shaped scatterer and of dentin slabs, with varying scatterer concentrations, are investigated. It is shown that the tomograms do not represent the physical structures present within the sample.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071094576", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56789676400": {"Name": "Brenner T.", "AuthorID": "56789676400", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Lasertechnologien in der Medizin und Me\u00dftechnik an der Universit\u00e4t Ulm"}, "23103476900": {"Name": "Kr\u00fcger B.", "AuthorID": "23103476900", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Lasertechnologien in der Medizin und Me\u00dftechnik an der Universit\u00e4t Ulm"}, "7006854912": {"Name": "Kienle A.", "AuthorID": "7006854912", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Lasertechnologien in der Medizin und Me\u00dftechnik an der Universit\u00e4t Ulm"}, "7102012051": {"Name": "Munro P.R.T.", "AuthorID": "7102012051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
