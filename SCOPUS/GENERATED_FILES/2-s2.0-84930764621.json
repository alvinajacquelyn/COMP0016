Abbt (1738-1766) criticised conjectural histories due to their arbitrary character, and opted for a synthetic approach consisting of both sacred and secular history. He suggested that the anthropology of Genesis should be accepted as the starting point for a conjectural history, since it left ample room for further questions and speculations. Yet his own perspective on human nature and its evolution remained naturalistic, as attested by his divergent interpretations of the confusion of tongues at Babel. Attempting to shed new light on the lesser-known elements of Abbt\u2019s work, the essay links his views on the Bible and conjectural history to his debate with Moses Mendelssohn over the constitution and destination of man. In his debate, both Mendelssohn and Abbt dealt with the contemporary controversy over the natural or artificial character of sociability, self-interest, and fellow-feeling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conjectural history", "Genesis", "Mendelssohn", "Rousseau", "Thomas Abbt", "Universal history"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930764621", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"55443214200": {"Name": "Lifschitz A.", "AuthorID": "55443214200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History, University College London"}}}
