All rights reserved.The differing methodologies employed by Canadian and United Kingdom universities in similar student capstone projects is presented. Polytechnique Montreal, from Canada, employs the Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate approach in its teachings. Its aerospace engineering undergraduate students are tasked with an integrative project every year, culminating to a capstone project. The presented project\u2019s goal was the design and prototyping of a dynamic test bench of a free motion, three degrees of freedom, 2D airfoil with a full-span flap for wind tunnel testing in Toulouse, France. The project was conducted in a multidisciplinary environment, under the supervision of local and international collaborators and received industry in-kind support. Similar to Polytechnique, the students at the University of Southampton were tasked with designing and testing a transferable wind tunnel test rig. The experimental test rig was designed to provide a flexible finite-span wing free motion in either a vertical translation or a rotation of the root point. Different numerical modeling approaches were undertaken for comparison with experimental results. The project was developed by consecutive Integrated Masters students with the help of industry specialists and international faculty advisors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic test benches", "Engineering undergraduates", "Finite span wings", "Numerical modeling approach", "Three degrees of freedom", "University of Southampton", "Wind tunnel tests", "Wind-tunnel testing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958101029", "SubjectAreas": [["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"]], "AuthorData": {"56840755800": {"Name": "Ferlisi C.A.", "AuthorID": "56840755800", "AffiliationID": "60019141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal"}, "57192715386": {"Name": "Mazzini C.F.", "AuthorID": "57192715386", "AffiliationID": "60019141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal"}, "16645782200": {"Name": "Laurendeau E.", "AuthorID": "16645782200", "AffiliationID": "60019141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal"}, "57200088418": {"Name": "Ramasawmy D.R.", "AuthorID": "57200088418", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "36598165200": {"Name": "da Ronch A.", "AuthorID": "36598165200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "16067481500": {"Name": "Stalnov O.", "AuthorID": "16067481500", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}}}
