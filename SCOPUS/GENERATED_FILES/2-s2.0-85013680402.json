TELEPROM-G is a mobile-based TELEmedicine and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement (PROM) platform designed to enhance delivery of health services among community-based older adults. This one-year pilot study will develop and test a digital system for treating 30 adults (aged 65 or older) with depressive symptoms living in the community by using mobile tablet devices equipped with a Collaborative Health Record (CHR), an e-Health mobile software platform created by InputHealth. Up to 15 multidisciplinary healthcare providers (HCPs) will be able to monitor changes in the health and functional well-being of their clients overtime allowing for early interventions if necessary. The built-in video conferencing functionality will allow for real-time clinical interactions in the client's home. This study will evaluate the value of InputHealth's CHR with clients through individual interviews and focus groups and conduct separate focus groups with HCPs to evaluate how it enhances their work with clients. The technology will be evaluated using four types of analyses including effectiveness, economic, policy, and ethics analysis (Forchuk, Rudnick, MacIntosh, Bukair & Hoch, 2016). Information gleaned from the results of the pilot will enhance the technology and lead to a larger cohort study across multiple sites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community-Based", "Health Records", "Health Technology", "Mental Health Care", "Seniors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community-based", "Health records", "Health technology", "Mental health", "Seniors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013680402", "SubjectAreas": [["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"34770046900": {"Name": "Forchuk C.", "AuthorID": "34770046900", "AffiliationID": "60026135", "AffiliationName": "RN Lawson Health Research Institute"}, "35170779900": {"Name": "O'Regan T.", "AuthorID": "35170779900", "AffiliationID": "60026135", "AffiliationName": "RN Lawson Health Research Institute"}, "7006078146": {"Name": "Cassidy K.", "AuthorID": "7006078146", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "FRCPC Dalhousie University"}, "7801312443": {"Name": "Burhan A.", "AuthorID": "7801312443", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western University and Parkwood Institute"}, "13410954600": {"Name": "Booth R.", "AuthorID": "13410954600", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western University"}, "12141166800": {"Name": "Lizotte D.", "AuthorID": "12141166800", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western University"}, "7102782412": {"Name": "Reiss J.", "AuthorID": "7102782412", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western University"}, "15023372200": {"Name": "Vasudev A.", "AuthorID": "15023372200", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "MRCPsych Western University"}, "7103032035": {"Name": "Hoch J.", "AuthorID": "7103032035", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California"}, "57193407171": {"Name": "Lewis M.", "AuthorID": "57193407171", "AffiliationID": "60010363", "AffiliationName": "St. Josephs Healthcare"}, "55053353900": {"Name": "Isaranuwatchai W.", "AuthorID": "55053353900", "AffiliationID": "60017018", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Excellence in Economic Analysis, St. Michael's Hospital"}, "7005446061": {"Name": "Rudnick A.", "AuthorID": "7005446061", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "McMaster University"}, "57189383055": {"Name": "Seth P.", "AuthorID": "57189383055", "AffiliationID": "60006826", "AffiliationName": "Woodstock General Hospital"}, "35605645500": {"Name": "Heisel M.", "AuthorID": "35605645500", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western Univeristy"}, "35609790000": {"Name": "Chambers M.", "AuthorID": "35609790000", "AffiliationID": "60033359, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Kingston University, St. George's University of London"}, "8511786600": {"Name": "Nolan F.", "AuthorID": "8511786600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7201816385": {"Name": "Flint A.", "AuthorID": "7201816385", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network"}, "6602552433": {"Name": "Looper K.", "AuthorID": "6602552433", "AffiliationID": "60018916", "AffiliationName": "Jewish General Hospital"}, "51061550900": {"Name": "Rej S.", "AuthorID": "51061550900", "AffiliationID": "60018916", "AffiliationName": "Jewish General Hospital"}}}
