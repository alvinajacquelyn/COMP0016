Association between inflammatory markers and specific symptoms may provide insights into potential mechanism of inflammation-related depression. Using longitudinal data, we have tested whether childhood serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with specific depressive symptoms in early adulthood. Methods: In the ALSPAC birth cohort, serum IL-6 and CRP levels were assessed at age 9 years and 19 depressive symptoms were assessed at age 18 years. We used modified Poisson generalised linear regression with robust error variance to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each depressive symptom. In addition, we used confirmatory factor analysis to create two continuous latent variables representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimension scores. Structural equation modelling was used to test the associations between IL-6 and these dimension scores. Results: Based on data from 2731 participants, IL-6 was associated with diurnal mood variation, concentration difficulties, fatigue and sleep disturbances. The adjusted RRs for these symptoms at age 18 years for participants in top, compared with bottom, third of IL-6 at age 9 years were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.13\u20132.69) for diurnal mood variation, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.11\u20132.02) for concentration difficulties, 1.31 (95% CI, 1.12\u20131.54) for fatigue, and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.01\u20131.52) for sleep disturbances. At dimension level, IL-6 was associated with both somatic/neurovegetative (\u03b2 = 0.059, SE = 0.024, P = 0.013) and psychological (\u03b2 = 0.056, SE = 0.023, P = 0.016) scores. Conclusions: Inflammation is associated with specific symptoms of depression. Associations with so-called somatic/neurovegetative symptoms of depression such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and diurnal mood variation indicate that these symptoms could be useful treatment targets and markers of treatment response in clinical trials of anti-inflammatory treatment for depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "C-reactive protein", "Cohort study", "Depression", "Immunopsychiatry", "Inflammation", "Interleukin 6", "Neurovegetative Symptoms", "Psychological Symptoms", "Somatic symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "England", "Fatigue", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056667769", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57204667801": {"Name": "Chu A.L.", "AuthorID": "57204667801", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "24072186500": {"Name": "Stochl J.", "AuthorID": "24072186500", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinanthropology, Charles University"}, "26021246400": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "26021246400", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24461777700": {"Name": "Khandaker G.M.", "AuthorID": "24461777700", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6603745740": {"Name": "Zammit S.", "AuthorID": "6603745740", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University"}}}
