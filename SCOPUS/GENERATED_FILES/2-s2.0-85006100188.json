We report a mixed methods qualitative study of transitions across health and social care services for children leaving care, providing narratives of what young people described as positive, and what they and professionals think might be improved. Methods: Data were collected in participatory meetings and individual interviews between young people and researchers (n = 24) and individual interviews with practitioners (n = 11). In addition to discussion and interview techniques, we used pictorial and other participatory methods. Interviews were coded by three members of the team and differences resolved with a fourth. Our analysis draws on thematic and framework approaches. Results: Health was rarely at the top of any young person's agenda, although gaps in health care and exceptional care were both described. Housing, financial support and education took priority. Young people and professionals alike emphasized the importance of workers prepared to go the extra mile; of young people being able to contact professionals; and professionals being able to contact one another. Conclusions: Policy and practice aspirations for care leavers recommend gradual change but transfer rather than transition continues to be described by care leavers. Our data support the need for transition as a long-term process, with children and young people having early opportunities to prepare for citizenship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescence", "care coordination", "looked-after children", "multidisciplinary", "transition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health Services", "Attitude to Health", "Community Participation", "Consumer Behavior", "England", "Foster Home Care", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Residential Facilities", "Social Work", "Transition to Adult Care", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006100188", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"15728298800": {"Name": "Liabo K.", "AuthorID": "15728298800", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}, "56850061700": {"Name": "McKenna C.", "AuthorID": "56850061700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7201465267": {"Name": "Roberts H.", "AuthorID": "7201465267", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56085308800": {"Name": "Ingold A.", "AuthorID": "56085308800", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "St Albans Hertfordshire, University of Exeter Medical School"}}}
