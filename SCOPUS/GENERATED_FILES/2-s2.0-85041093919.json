Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of vitreous activity is an alternative to clinical vitreous haze scoring and has passed a number of early validation studies. In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of 'operator factors' on the variability of the technique as part of the validation process, and to help evaluate its suitability for 'real world' use. Vitreous haze index was calculated as a ratio between the reflectivity of the vitreous and of the outer retina in each scan. Different scanning conditions were tested and their effect on the measurement is reported. Our results show that the 'quantitative imaging' technique of OCT-measured vitreous activity had good reliability in normal subjects under a range of 'real world' conditions, such as when the operator changes the averaging value. The technique was however vulnerable to highly inaccurate focussing or abnormal downward displacement of the image. OCT-based quantification of vitreous activity is a promising alternative to current subjective clinical estimates, with sufficient 'tolerance' to be used in routine clinical practice as well as clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Uveitis", "Vitreous Body"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041093919", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56681936600": {"Name": "Montesano G.", "AuthorID": "56681936600", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London, Optometry and Visual Sciences"}, "57190617676": {"Name": "Ometto G.", "AuthorID": "57190617676", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London, Optometry and Visual Sciences"}, "57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.R.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "54790536300": {"Name": "Crabb D.P.", "AuthorID": "54790536300", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London, Optometry and Visual Sciences"}, "57200389296": {"Name": "Way C.M.", "AuthorID": "57200389296", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200397746": {"Name": "Ibrahim H.", "AuthorID": "57200397746", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200397709": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57200397709", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54880010400": {"Name": "Denniston A.K.", "AuthorID": "54880010400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57200387401": {"Name": "Carmichael R.", "AuthorID": "57200387401", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003670895": {"Name": "Aslam T.", "AuthorID": "7003670895", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Built Environment, Heriot-Watt University"}}}
