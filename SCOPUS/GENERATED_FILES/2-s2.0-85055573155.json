A mathematical model describing the statistical characteristics of inter-carrier interference (ICI) is derived and verified through system model simulations. Results show that the ICI is of normal distribution, whose variance is dependent on both the level of bandwidth compression and on the signal level. Models developed are used to derive the error bounds of SEFDM signals in Gaussian noise channels, as well as the upper bound of SEFDM spectral efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gaussian noise channels", "Intercarrier interference", "Interference distribution", "Multicarrier signal", "Orthogonal frequency division", "Spectral efficiencies", "Statistical characteristics", "Statistical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055573155", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57151150900": {"Name": "Ghannam H.", "AuthorID": "57151150900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}}}
