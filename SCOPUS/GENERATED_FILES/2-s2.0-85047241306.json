The aim of this study was to perform serial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to examine immediate and long-term haemodynamic and vascular changes following bioresorbable scaffold placement. Methods and results Coronary arterial models with long-term serial assessment (baseline and 5 years) were reconstructed through fusion of intravascular optical coherence tomography and angiography. Pulsatile non-Newtonian CFD simulations were performed to calculate the ESS and relative blood viscosity. Time-averaged, systolic, and diastolic results were compared between follow-ups. Seven patients (seven lesions) were included in this analysis. A marked heterogeneity in ESS and localised regions of high blood viscosity were observed post-implantation. Percent vessel area exposed to low averaged ESS (<1 Pa) significantly decreased over 5 years (15.92% vs. 4.99%, P < 0.0001) whereas moderate (1-7 Pa) and high ESS (>7 Pa) did not significantly change (moderate ESS: 76.93% vs. 80.7%, P = 0.546; high ESS: 7.15% vs. 14.31%, P = 0.281), leading to higher ESS at follow-up. A positive correlation was observed between baseline ESS and change in lumen area at 5 years (P < 0.0001). Maximum blood viscosity significantly decreased over 5 years (4.30 \u00b1 1.54 vs. 3.21\u00b1 0.57, P = 0.028). Conclusion Immediately after scaffold implantation, coronary arteries demonstrate an alternans of extremely low and high ESS values and localized areas of high blood viscosity. These initial local haemodynamic disturbances may trigger fibrin deposition and thrombosis. Also, low ESS can promote neointimal hyperplasia, but may also contribute to appropriate scaffold healing with normalisation of ESS and reduction in peak blood viscosity by 5 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioabsorbable scaffold", "Blood viscosity", "Shear stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorbable Implants", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Coronary Vessels", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Hydrodynamics", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Stress, Mechanical", "Time Factors", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047241306", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56655109600": {"Name": "Thondapu V.", "AuthorID": "56655109600", "AffiliationID": "60118549, 60026553, 60024749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne"}, "36081212200": {"Name": "Poon E.K.W.", "AuthorID": "36081212200", "AffiliationID": "60118503, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "7005905452": {"Name": "Ooi A.", "AuthorID": "7005905452", "AffiliationID": "60118503, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "57200179677": {"Name": "Revalor E.", "AuthorID": "57200179677", "AffiliationID": "60118503, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "57206403256": {"Name": "Barlis P.", "AuthorID": "57206403256", "AffiliationID": "60118549, 60026553, 60024749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne"}, "23669358200": {"Name": "Tenekecioglu E.", "AuthorID": "23669358200", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Thoraxcenter"}, "15051093400": {"Name": "Onuma Y.", "AuthorID": "15051093400", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Thoraxcenter"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60009009, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Science Division, National Heart and Lung Institute, Guy Scadding Building, Royal Brompton Campus, Imperial College"}, "57189342058": {"Name": "Collet C.", "AuthorID": "57189342058", "AffiliationID": "60069985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Brussels"}, "57115149800": {"Name": "Sotomi Y.", "AuthorID": "57115149800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7005835193": {"Name": "Torii R.", "AuthorID": "7005835193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57204936293": {"Name": "Chin C.", "AuthorID": "57204936293", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide"}, "56603903800": {"Name": "Jonker H.", "AuthorID": "56603903800", "AffiliationID": "60070156", "AffiliationName": "Department of Program Management, Cardialysis"}, "7101611206": {"Name": "Dijkstra J.", "AuthorID": "7101611206", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6603599539": {"Name": "Gijsen F.", "AuthorID": "6603599539", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University Medical Center"}}}
