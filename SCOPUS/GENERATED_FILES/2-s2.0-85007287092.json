Here we use a theoretical and computational approach we have recently introduced to describe the linear and nonlinear optical physics of nanostructured 2D materials embedded in periodic structures containing regular three-dimensional (3D) optical media, such as diffraction gratings and metamaterials. Thus, we use the proposed method to demonstrate enhanced nonlinear optical interactions in periodic photonic nanostructures via resonant excitation of phase-matched waveguide modes, enhanced nonlinearity of nanostructures containing graphene and other 2D nanomaterials, and Fano resonances for increasing the efficiency of 2D-3D heteromaterials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational approach", "Computational model", "Nonlinear optical effects", "Nonlinear optical interactions", "Nonlinear optical response", "Photonic nanostructures", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Two Dimensional (2 D)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007287092", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "55671101600": {"Name": "Weismann M.", "AuthorID": "55671101600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}}}
