VFs were continuously imaged with cine-MRI during a 10-s period of quiet respiration and phonation. Scanning was repeated twice within an individual session and then once again at a 1-week interval. Asymmetry of VF position during phonation (VF phonation asymmetry, VFPa) and respiration (VF respiration asymmetry, VFRa) was determined. Percentage reduction in total glottal area between respiration and phonation (VF abduction potential, VFAP) was derived to measure overall mobility. An un-paired t-test was used to compare differences between groups. Intra-session, inter-session and inter-reader repeatability of the quantitative metrics was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: VF position asymmetry (VFPa and VFRa) was greater (p=0.012; p=0.001) and overall mobility (VFAP) was lower (p=0.008) in UVFP patients compared with healthy participants. ICC of repeatability of all metrics was good, ranged from 0.82 to 0.95 except for the inter-session VFPa (0.44). Conclusion: Cine-MRI is feasible for assessing VF abduction and adduction. Derived quantitative metrics have good repeatability. Key points: \u2022 Cine-MRI is used to assess vocal folds (VFs) mobility: abduction and adduction. \u2022 New quantitative metrics are derived from VF position and abduction potential. \u2022 Cine-MRI able to depict the difference between normal and abnormal VF mobility. \u2022 Cine-MRI derived quantitative metrics have good repeatability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cine", "Feasibility study", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Vocal fold paralysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Phonation", "Reproducibility of Results", "Vocal Cord Paralysis", "Vocal Cords"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963754466", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8866831100": {"Name": "Baki M.M.", "AuthorID": "8866831100", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, National University of Malaysia"}, "8725282000": {"Name": "Bassett P.", "AuthorID": "8725282000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "54886504700": {"Name": "Menys A.", "AuthorID": "54886504700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Trust, Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital"}, "7103279928": {"Name": "Morley S.", "AuthorID": "7103279928", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "15134919600": {"Name": "Beale T.", "AuthorID": "15134919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Trust, Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital"}, "57188842310": {"Name": "Naduvilethil G.", "AuthorID": "57188842310", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Trust, Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital"}, "57188835288": {"Name": "Stevenson N.", "AuthorID": "57188835288", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Trust, Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57212668367": {"Name": "Sandhu G.", "AuthorID": "57212668367", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}}}
