Methods: A panel of experienced OCT researchers (including 11 neurologists, 2 ophthalmologists, and 2 neuroscientists) discussed requirements for performing and reporting quantitative analyses of retinal morphology and developed a list of initial recommendations based on experience and previous studies. The list of recommendations was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group. Results: We provide a 9-point checklist encompassing aspects deemed relevant when reporting quantitative OCT studies. The areas covered are study protocol, acquisition device, acquisition settings, scanning protocol, funduscopic imaging, postacquisition data selection, postacquisition data analysis, recommended nomenclature, and statistical analysis. Conclusions: The Advised Protocol for OCT Study Terminology and Elements recommendations include core items to standardize and improve quality of reporting in quantitative OCT studies. The recommendations will make reporting of quantitative OCT studies more consistent and in line with existing standards for reporting research in other biomedical areas. The recommendations originated from expert consensus and thus represent Class IV evidence. They will need to be regularly adjusted according to new insights and practices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Checklist", "Humans", "Research Design", "Terminology as Topic", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974733313", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56222297400": {"Name": "Cruz-Herranz A.", "AuthorID": "56222297400", "AffiliationID": "60074643, 60023691", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}, "6602074839": {"Name": "Villoslada P.", "AuthorID": "6602074839", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"}, "8675686800": {"Name": "Green A.J.", "AuthorID": "8675686800", "AffiliationID": "60074643, 60023691", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}, "35200468000": {"Name": "Balk L.J.", "AuthorID": "35200468000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "44861672100": {"Name": "Oberwahrenbrock T.", "AuthorID": "44861672100", "AffiliationID": "60024629", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine"}, "57033685900": {"Name": "Paul F.", "AuthorID": "57033685900", "AffiliationID": "60024629", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine"}, "22950037300": {"Name": "Brandt A.U.", "AuthorID": "22950037300", "AffiliationID": "60024629", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine"}, "26428499000": {"Name": "Saidha S.", "AuthorID": "26428499000", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University"}, "35290391600": {"Name": "Calabresi P.", "AuthorID": "35290391600", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University"}, "31967711400": {"Name": "Martinez-Lapiscina E.H.", "AuthorID": "31967711400", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"}, "7003271235": {"Name": "Lagreze W.A.", "AuthorID": "7003271235", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Eye Center, University Medical Center"}, "7007053912": {"Name": "Schuman J.S.", "AuthorID": "7007053912", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Ophthalmology, New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7004524080": {"Name": "Balcer L.", "AuthorID": "7004524080", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, New York University, School of Medicine"}, "55443616500": {"Name": "Albrecht P.", "AuthorID": "55443616500", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"}}}
