In distributed compressive sensing (DCS), in addition to intra-signal correlation, inter-signal correlation is also exploited in the joint signal reconstruction, which goes beyond the aim of the conventional dictionary learning framework. In this letter, we propose a new dictionary learning framework in order to improve signal reconstruction performance in DCS applications. By capitalizing on the sparse common component and innovations (SCCI) model , which captures both intra- and inter-signal correlation, the proposed method iteratively finds a dictionary design that promotes various goals: i) signal representation; ii) intra-signal correlation; and iii) inter-signal correlation. Simulation results showthat our dictionary design leads to an improved DCS reconstruction performance in comparison to other designs. \u00a9 1994-2012 IEEE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "dictionary learning", "distributed compressive sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "Dictionary designs", "Dictionary learning", "Signal representations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84906751277", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57189260407": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "57189260407", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "35560362100": {"Name": "Wassell I.", "AuthorID": "35560362100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7202521476": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "7202521476", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
