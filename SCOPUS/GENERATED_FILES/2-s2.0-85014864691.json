Here we demonstrate the safety and efficiency of Anc80L65, a rationally designed synthetic vector, for transgene delivery to the mouse cochlea. Ex vivo transduction of mouse organotypic explants identified Anc80L65 from a set of other adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors as a potent vector for the cochlear cell targets. Round window membrane injection resulted in highly efficient transduction of inner and outer hair cells in mice, a substantial improvement over conventional AAV vectors. Anc80L65 round window injection was well tolerated, as indicated by sensory cell function, hearing and vestibular function, and immunologic parameters. The ability of Anc80L65 to target outer hair cells at high rates, a requirement for restoration of complex auditory function, may enable future gene therapies for hearing and balance disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adeno-associated virus vectors", "Balance disorders", "Mammalian inner ear", "Outer hair cell", "Safety and efficiencies", "Sensory cells", "Synthetic vector", "Window injection", "Animals", "Cochlea", "Dependovirus", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Plasmids", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014864691", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55943116900": {"Name": "Landegger L.D.", "AuthorID": "55943116900", "AffiliationID": "60026929, 60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Vienna General Hospital, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006851428": {"Name": "Forge A.", "AuthorID": "7006851428", "AffiliationID": "113489174", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology"}, "57206682355": {"Name": "Pan B.", "AuthorID": "57206682355", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, F.M.
