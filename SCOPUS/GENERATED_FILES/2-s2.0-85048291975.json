Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sputum smear-negative HIV-associated active tuberculosis (TB) is challenging to diagnose. CD14 is a pattern recognition receptor that is known to mediate monocyte activation. Prior studies have shown increased levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14) as a potential biomarker for TB, but little is known about its value in detecting smear-negative HIV-associated TB. We optimized a sandwich ELISA for the detection of sCD14, and tested sera from 56 smear-negative South African (39 culture-positive and 17 culture-negative) HIV-infected pulmonary TB patients and 24 South African and 43 US (21 positive and 22 negative for tuberculin skin test, respectively) HIV-infected controls. SCD14 concentrations were significantly elevated in smear-negative HIV-associated TB compared with the HIV-infected controls (p < 0.0001), who had similar concentrations, irrespective of the country of origin or the presence or absence of latent M. tuberculosis infection (p = 0.19). The culture-confirmed TB group had a median sCD14 level of 2199 ng/mL (interquartile range 1927\u20132719 ng/mL), versus 1148 ng/mL (interquartile range 1053\u20131412 ng/mL) for the South African controls. At a specificity of 96%, sCD14 had a sensitivity of 95% for culture-confirmed smear-negative TB. These data indicate that sCD14 could be a highly accurate biomarker for the detection of HIV-associated TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "C-reactive protein", "CD14", "Diagnostics", "HIV", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048291975", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57205081700": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57205081700", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "55687630400": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "55687630400", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "57191693148": {"Name": "Jenny-Avital E.R.", "AuthorID": "57191693148", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "7003748071": {"Name": "Achkar J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003748071", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "55975004300": {"Name": "Ndumnego O.C.", "AuthorID": "55975004300", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung\u2019u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute of Infection Biology"}, "7202933117": {"Name": "Kim R.S.", "AuthorID": "7202933117", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "22136817500": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "22136817500", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60028197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Edendale Hospital, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
