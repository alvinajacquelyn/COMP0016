In this study, we show that Gli3 activity in the FL stroma is required for B cell development. In the Gli3-deficient FL, B cell development was reduced at multiple stages, whereas the Sonic hedgehog (Hh [Shh])-deficient FL showed increased B cell development, and Gli3 functioned to repress Shh transcription. Use of a transgenic Hh-reporter mouse showed that Shh signals directly to developing B cells and that Hh pathway activation was increased in developing B cells from Gli3-deficient FLs. RNA sequencing confirmed that Hh-mediated transcription is increased in Blineage cells from Gli3-deficient FL and showed that these cells expressed reduced levels of B-lineage transcription factors and B cell receptor (BCR)/pre-BCR-signaling genes. Expression of the master regulators of B cell development Ebf1 and Pax5 was reduced in developing B cells from Gli3-deficient FL but increased in Shh-deficient FL, and in vitro Shh treatment or neutralization reduced or increased their expression, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cell Lineage", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Liver", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "PAX5 Transcription Factor", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Signal Transduction", "Trans-Activators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022070634", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56677505400": {"Name": "Solanki A.", "AuthorID": "56677505400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55221935000": {"Name": "Lau C.I.", "AuthorID": "55221935000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "37040794300": {"Name": "Salda\u00f1a J.I.", "AuthorID": "37040794300", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Health, Sport and Bioscience, University of East London"}, "57197914651": {"Name": "Ross S.", "AuthorID": "57197914651", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "54790576500": {"Name": "Crompton T.", "AuthorID": "54790576500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
