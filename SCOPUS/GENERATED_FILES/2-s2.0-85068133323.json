There is increased incidence of graft loss and non-adherence following transfer to adult services. Although studies have considered the views and perceptions of young people who have undergone liver transplantation and their parents about transition, there is currently no qualitative research with healthcare professionals working in the field of liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to elicit the views of this group of stakeholders about barriers and facilitators of an effective transition process. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 11 HCPs from pediatric and adult liver transplant programs and from a range of professional backgrounds. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: \u201cnon-adherence and psychosocial issues,\u201d \u201cneed for better psychological support,\u201d \u201cthe role of parents,\u201d and \u201cthe emotional impact of transition on healthcare professionals.\u201d Within these themes, professionals described factors which hindered or promoted an effective transition process. Conclusions: Screening tools which address psychological and social aspects of the lives of young people should be used in routine practice to identify patients requiring psychosocial support and to identify those at risk of non-adherence. All staff involved with transition should be trained in the use of psychosocial screening strategies. The development of a formal referral pathway so that young people can access psychological support in adult services is recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["liver transplantation", "qualitative", "staff", "transition", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Parents", "Patient Compliance", "Postoperative Complications", "Postoperative Period", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Referral and Consultation", "Risk", "Transition to Adult Care", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068133323", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57214043127": {"Name": "Wright J.", "AuthorID": "57214043127", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "37027945400": {"Name": "Elwell L.", "AuthorID": "37027945400", "AffiliationID": "60006287", "AffiliationName": "Health and Wellbeing, National Grid"}, "7006857446": {"Name": "McDonagh J.", "AuthorID": "7006857446", "AffiliationID": "60111801", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "57203588678": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "57203588678", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005958111": {"Name": "McClean P.", "AuthorID": "7005958111", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403327883": {"Name": "Ferguson J.", "AuthorID": "7403327883", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203081145": {"Name": "Wray J.", "AuthorID": "57203081145", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
