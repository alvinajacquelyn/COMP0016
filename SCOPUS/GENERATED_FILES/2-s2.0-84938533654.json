We explain how these mechanisms, when applied to more complex numerical expressions such as \u2018between n and m\u2019 (e.g., \u2018between three and five students\u2019), predict a surprising ambiguity between a doubly bounded (e.g., \u2018at least three and at most five students\u2019) and a lower-bounded reading (e.g., \u2018at least three students\u2019). While the lower-bounded reading is not detectable intuitively, results from three offline experiments and a response time study provide evidence in favour of its existence. Our contribution is twofold. On the experimental side, we present two psycholinguistic methods powerful enough to detect what we call phantom readings, i.e., readings that do not seem to have consequences for actual interpretation, but have detectable effects on processing. On the theoretical side, we show that certain semantic mechanisms that might be thought to overgenerate are in fact vindicated, since they are able to predict certain processing facts that would otherwise remain mysterious. We discuss how these results illustrate the need for a strong integration of formal semantics and psycholinguistic approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ambiguity detection", "bare numerals", "modified numerals", "scalar implicatures"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938533654", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55761688000": {"Name": "Marty P.", "AuthorID": "55761688000", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "26535556100": {"Name": "Chemla E.", "AuthorID": "26535556100", "AffiliationID": "60105775, 60000179, 60008134, 60025070", "AffiliationName": "CNRS-ENS-EHESS, Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique"}, "37089624600": {"Name": "Spector B.", "AuthorID": "37089624600", "AffiliationID": "60105767, 60000179, 60008134, 60025070", "AffiliationName": "CNRS-ENS-EHESS, Institut Jean Nicod, 29 rue d'Ulm \u2013 Pavillon Jardin"}}}
