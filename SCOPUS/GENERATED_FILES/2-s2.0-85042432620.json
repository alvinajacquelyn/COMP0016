Controversy exists regarding optimal timing and use of Allo-HSCT in adults, due to lack of experience and previous poor outcomes. Twenty-nine consecutive adult patients, with a mean age at transplant of 24 years (range, 17-50 years), underwent Allo-HSCT. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) included flu-darabine (Flu)/melphalan/alemtuzumab (n 5 20), Flu/busulfan (Bu)/alemtuzumab (n 5 8), and Flu/Bu/antithymocyte globulin (n 5 1). Stem cell donors were matched unrelated donors or mismatched unrelated donors (n 5 18) and matched related donors (n 5 11). Overall survival (OS), event-free survival, transplant-related mortality (TRM), acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease incidence and severity, time to engraftment, lineage-specific chimerism, immune reconstitution, and discontinuation of immunoglobulin replacement therapy were recorded. OS at 3 years for the whole cohort was 85.2%. The rarer PID patients without chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) achieved an OS at 3 years of 88.9% (n 5 18), compared with 81.8% for CGD patients (n 5 11). TRM was low with only 4 deaths observed at a median follow-up of 3.5 years. There were no cases of early or late rejection. In all surviving patients, either stable mixed chimerism or full donor chimerism were observed. At last follow-up, 87% of the surviving patients had no evidence of persistent or recurrent infections. Allo-HSCT is safe and effective in young adult patients with severe PID and should be considered the treatment of choice where an appropriate donor is available.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Survival Rate", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042432620", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57194175232": {"Name": "Fox T.A.", "AuthorID": "57194175232", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, 2nd Floor, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "6701831494": {"Name": "Chakraverty R.", "AuthorID": "6701831494", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "8778070100": {"Name": "Burns S.", "AuthorID": "8778070100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, 2nd Floor, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "7102495795": {"Name": "Carpenter B.", "AuthorID": "7102495795", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Teenage and Young Adult BMT Programme, UCL Hospital NHS FT"}, "56179054100": {"Name": "Thomson K.", "AuthorID": "56179054100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "7102396522": {"Name": "Fielding A.", "AuthorID": "7102396522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "6701389817": {"Name": "Kottaridis P.", "AuthorID": "6701389817", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free London NHS FT"}, "36124830600": {"Name": "Denovan S.", "AuthorID": "36124830600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Teenage and Young Adult BMT Programme, UCL Hospital NHS FT"}, "7006091031": {"Name": "Grace S.", "AuthorID": "7006091031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Teenage and Young Adult BMT Programme, UCL Hospital NHS FT"}, "57193540097": {"Name": "Dahlstrom J.", "AuthorID": "57193540097", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Teenage and Young Adult BMT Programme, UCL Hospital NHS FT"}, "7202865272": {"Name": "Mackinnon S.", "AuthorID": "7202865272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, 2nd Floor, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "6508363080": {"Name": "Grandage V.", "AuthorID": "6508363080", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Teenage and Young Adult BMT Programme, UCL Hospital NHS FT"}, "9941088900": {"Name": "Hough R.", "AuthorID": "9941088900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Teenage and Young Adult BMT Programme, UCL Hospital NHS FT"}, "57213673329": {"Name": "Lowe D.", "AuthorID": "57213673329", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, 2nd Floor, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "35965274600": {"Name": "Buckland M.", "AuthorID": "35965274600", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, 2nd Floor, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "22936207500": {"Name": "Workman S.", "AuthorID": "22936207500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Royal Free London NHS FT"}, "16551448500": {"Name": "Symes A.", "AuthorID": "16551448500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Royal Free London NHS FT"}, "24777297600": {"Name": "Uttenthal B.", "AuthorID": "24777297600", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes\u2019 Hospital"}, "57193206030": {"Name": "Bigley V.", "AuthorID": "57193206030", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}}}
