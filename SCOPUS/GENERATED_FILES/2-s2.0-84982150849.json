The influence of the structure of a DVL on the radiation force distribution is analyzed. It is found by numerical simulations that the modulated beams show a clear advantage over the unmodulated highly focused radially polarized beams, as the modulated beam can simultaneously trap and manipulate the multiple Rayleigh particles, while the unmodulated beam can trap only one particle under the same condition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Modulated beams", "Radially polarized beam", "Radiation forces", "Rayleigh particle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982150849", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"56547650000": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "56547650000", "AffiliationID": "60006106", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Light Propagation and Transformation, Huaqiao University"}, "55551428100": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "55551428100", "AffiliationID": "60006106", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Light Propagation and Transformation, Huaqiao University"}, "7102908971": {"Name": "Pu J.", "AuthorID": "7102908971", "AffiliationID": "60006106", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Light Propagation and Transformation, Huaqiao University"}, "55474788000": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "55474788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
