Observational evidence for this dust production efficiency is however currently limited to only a few CCSN remnants (e.g. SN 1987A, Crab nebula). In this paper, we revisit the dust mass produced in Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a ~330-yr old O-rich Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) embedded in a dense interstellar foreground and background. We present the first spatially resolved analysis of Cas A based on Spitzer and Herschel infrared and submillimetre data at a common resolution of ~0.6 arcmin for this 5 arcmin diameter remnant following a careful removal of contaminating line emission and synchrotron radiation. We fit the dust continuum from 17 to 500 \u03bcm with a four-component interstellar medium and supernova (SN) dust model.We find a concentration of cold dust in the unshocked ejecta of Cas A and derive a mass of 0.3-0.5M\u2299 of silicate grains freshly produced in the SNR, with a lower limit of \u22650.1- 0.2 M\u2299. For a mixture of 50 per cent of silicate-type grains and 50 per cent of carbonaceous grains, we derive a total SN dust mass between 0.4 and 0.6M\u2299. These dust mass estimates are higher than from most previous studies of Cas A and support the scenario of SN-dominated dust production at high redshifts. We furthermore derive an interstellar extinction map for the field around Cas A which towards Cas A gives average values of AV = 6-8 mag, up to a maximum of AV = 15 mag.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dust", "Extinction", "Infrared: ISM", "ISM: supernova remnants", "Supernovae: individual: Cassiopeia A"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014653212", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"36238023800": {"Name": "De Looze I.", "AuthorID": "36238023800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "18041819500": {"Name": "Barlow M.J.", "AuthorID": "18041819500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007047134": {"Name": "Swinyard B.M.", "AuthorID": "7007047134", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "RAL Space, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7003586236": {"Name": "Wesson R.", "AuthorID": "7003586236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35330667600": {"Name": "Rho J.", "AuthorID": "35330667600", "AffiliationID": "60007478", "AffiliationName": "SETI Institute"}, "8709470300": {"Name": "Gomez H.L.", "AuthorID": "8709470300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "8395396700": {"Name": "Matsuura M.", "AuthorID": "8395396700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}}}
