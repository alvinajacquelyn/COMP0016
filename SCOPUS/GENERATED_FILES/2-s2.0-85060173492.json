Recently, ATLAS also recorded 3\u03bcb\u22121 of Xe+Xe collisions at the center-of-mass energy 5.44 TeV, which provides a new opportunity to study the system-size dependence of the charged-hadron production in heavy-ion collisions. The large acceptance of the ATLAS detector allows to measure the spectra of charged hadrons in a wide range of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum. The nuclear modification factors RAA are constructed as a ratio of the spectra measured in Pb+Pb or Xe+Xe collisions to that measured in pp collisions. The RAA obtained in the two systems are presented for different centrality intervals and the results are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["charged-hadron production", "lead\u2013lead collisions", "nuclear modification factor", "xenon\u2013xenon collisions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060173492", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"55341067700": {"Name": "Balek P.", "AuthorID": "55341067700", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Faculty of Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
