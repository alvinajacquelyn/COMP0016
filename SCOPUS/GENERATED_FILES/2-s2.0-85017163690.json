All rights reserved.Background: Inflammation has been linked with development of some cancers. We investigated systemic inflammation in relation to colorectal cancer incidence and subsequent survival using common serum inflammatory markers. Design: A cohort of men and women aged 20 years and older in greater Stockholm area with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin measured between 1986 and 1999 were included (n=325 599). A subset of these had baseline measurements of haptoglobin and leukocytes. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to assess risk of colorectal cancer by levels of inflammatory markers, adjusting for potential confounders. Analyses were stratified by circulating glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Overall and CRC-specific death following diagnosis were assessed as secondary outcomes. Results: A total of 4764 individuals were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. A positive association between haptoglobin and colorectal cancer incidence was found (hazard ratio (HR): 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06-1.28). A positive association was also observed with leukocytes (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42). No evidence of association was noted between CRP and colorectal cancer risk. Higher risks of all-cause death were seen with haptoglobin and leukocytes levels. Higher haptoglobin levels were linked with an increased risk of colorectal cancer death (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01-1.41). Conclusions: Prediagnostic systemic inflammation may impact colorectal cancer incidence and survival; therefore, prompting investigations linking inflammatory pathways preceding colorectal cancer with disease severity and progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["albumin", "colorectal cancer", "CRP", "haptoglobin", "leukocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Glucose", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cause of Death", "Cholesterol", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Female", "Haptoglobins", "Humans", "Incidence", "Leukocyte Count", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Serum Albumin", "Survival Rate", "Sweden", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017163690", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57193859896": {"Name": "Ghuman S.", "AuthorID": "57193859896", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Group, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "25932351400": {"Name": "Van Hemelrijck M.", "AuthorID": "25932351400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Group, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "6603460135": {"Name": "Garmo H.", "AuthorID": "6603460135", "AffiliationID": "112954122", "AffiliationName": "Regional Cancer Centre"}, "34770502400": {"Name": "Holmberg L.", "AuthorID": "34770502400", "AffiliationID": "60015216", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University Hospital"}, "55372637900": {"Name": "Wulaningsih W.", "AuthorID": "55372637900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "55794071700": {"Name": "Lambe M.", "AuthorID": "55794071700", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004699997": {"Name": "Malmstr\u00f6m H.", "AuthorID": "7004699997", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7006083229": {"Name": "Hammar N.", "AuthorID": "7006083229", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55530293100": {"Name": "Walldius G.", "AuthorID": "55530293100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6603058283": {"Name": "Jungner I.", "AuthorID": "6603058283", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Clinical Epidemiological Unit, Karolinska Institutet and CALAB Research"}}}
