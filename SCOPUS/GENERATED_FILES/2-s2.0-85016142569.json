Despite its importance, initial searches revealed no obviously dominant definitions of the term \u2018energy services\u2019, and inconsistent illustrative examples. This paper presents the results of a content analysis and literature review which aimed to answer the question: \u2018what are energy services?\u2019. One hundred and eighty-five articles from the journals Energy Policy and Energy Research and Social Science containing the term \u201cenergy service*\u201d in the title, abstract or keywords were analysed, and additional documents relevant to the concept were identified for review. In total, 27 definitions of \u2018energy services\u2019 were recorded, and 173 separate examples (such as \u2018space heating\u2019 or \u2018lighting\u2019). Thematic analysis of the definitions revealed a number of recurring themes, such as \u2018useful energy/work\u2019 and the provision of \u2018benefits\u2019 to people. Previous literature suggested the importance of distinguishing between \u2018energy services\u2019 and the \u2018end services or states\u2019 which they help obtain. On the basis of the identified themes, examples and conceptual discussion, the following definition of \u2018energy services\u2019 is proposed: Energy services are those functions performed using energy which are means to obtain or facilitate desired end services or states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Content analysis", "Definition", "End services", "Energy services"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016142569", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"55901208400": {"Name": "Fell M.J.", "AuthorID": "55901208400", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, Central House"}}}
