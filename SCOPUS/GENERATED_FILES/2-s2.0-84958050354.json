These reforms were mainly implemented in secondary education \u2013 based upon the assumption that this is where Spain's educational problems lie. This paper questions this assumption by attempting to identify the point where Spanish children fall behind young people in other developed countries. Specifically, by drawing data from multiple international assessments, we are able to explore how cross-national differences in reading skills change as children age. Consideration is given to both the average level of achievement and the evolution of educational inequalities. Our conclusion is that policy-makers have focused their efforts on the wrong part of the education system; educational achievement is low in Spain (and educational inequalities large) long before children enter secondary school. This study therefore serves as a note of caution against simplistic interpretation of the PISA rankings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic performance", "Educational policy", "PIRLS", "PISA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958050354", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"35361510900": {"Name": "Choi \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "35361510900", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Economics, Political Economy and Spanish Economy, Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Barcelona"}, "54418736800": {"Name": "Jerrim J.", "AuthorID": "54418736800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, University College London Institute of Education"}}}
