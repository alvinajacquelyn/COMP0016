This paper considers opportunities and challenges in employing the Behavior Change Techniques Taxonomy (BCTTv1) developed by Michie and colleagues, to code the behavior change techniques (BCTs) across multiple interventions addressing obesity and capture dose received at the technique level. Numerous advantages were recognized for using a shared framework for intervention description. Coding interventions at levels of the social ecological framework beyond the individual level, separate coding for behavior change initiation vs. maintenance, fidelity of BCT delivery, accounting for BCTs mode of delivery, and tailoring BCTs, present both challenges and opportunities. Deconstructing interventions and identifying the dose required to positively impact health-related outcomes could enable important gains in intervention science.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intervention science", "Pooled analysis", "Taxonomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavior Therapy", "Clinical Coding", "Health Behavior", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Obesity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976584573", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7103286984": {"Name": "Tate D.", "AuthorID": "7103286984", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "7005769894": {"Name": "Lytle L.", "AuthorID": "7005769894", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Behavior, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "7403364121": {"Name": "Ward D.", "AuthorID": "7403364121", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "7006793768": {"Name": "Sherwood N.", "AuthorID": "7006793768", "AffiliationID": "60013660", "AffiliationName": "HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research"}, "7003810851": {"Name": "Haire-Joshu D.", "AuthorID": "7003810851", "AffiliationID": "60073778, 60010261", "AffiliationName": "The Brown School, Washington University"}, "7005863834": {"Name": "Matheson D.", "AuthorID": "7005863834", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics & Stanford Prevention Research Center, Stanford University"}, "7403537458": {"Name": "Moore S.", "AuthorID": "7403537458", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University"}, "7004668410": {"Name": "Loria C.", "AuthorID": "7004668410", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH"}, "35269788600": {"Name": "Pratt C.", "AuthorID": "35269788600", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH"}, "8848201600": {"Name": "Belle S.", "AuthorID": "8848201600", "AffiliationID": "60003742", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
