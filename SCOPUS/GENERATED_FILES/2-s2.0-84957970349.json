The mechanism for this association is not known. The capacity of pneumococci to adhere to and infect lower airway cells is mediated by host-expressed platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR). Objective We sought to assess the effect of mild steel welding fumes (MS-WF) on PAFR-dependent pneumococcal adhesion and infection to human airway cells in vitro and on pneumococcal airway infection in a mouse model. Methods The oxidative potential of MS-WF was assessed by their capacity to reduce antioxidants in vitro. Pneumococcal adhesion and infection of A549, BEAS-2B, and primary human bronchial airway cells were assessed by means of quantitative bacterial culture and expressed as colony-forming units (CFU). After intranasal instillation of MS-WF, mice were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung CFU values were determined. PAFR protein levels were assessed by using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, and PAFR mRNA expression was assessed by using quantitative PCR. PAFR was blocked by CV-3988, and oxidative stress was attenuated by N-acetylcysteine. Results MS-WF exhibited high oxidative potential. In A549 and BEAS-2B cells MS-WF increased pneumococcal adhesion and infection and PAFR protein expression. Both CV-3988 and N-acetylcysteine reduced MS-WF-stimulated pneumococcal adhesion and infection of airway cells. MS-WF increased mouse lung PAFR mRNA expression and increased BALF and lung pneumococcal CFU values. In MS-WF-exposed mice CV-3988 reduced BALF CFU values. Conclusions Hypersusceptibility of welders to pneumococcal pneumonia is in part mediated by the capacity of welding fumes to increase PAFR-dependent pneumococcal adhesion and infection of lower airway cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bacterial adhesion and infection", "Occupational disease", "platelet-activating factor receptor", "pneumonia", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "welding fumes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bacterial Adhesion", "Bacterial Load", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Cell Line", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Susceptibility", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Metals, Heavy", "Mice", "Occupational Exposure", "Oxidative Stress", "Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins", "Pneumonia, Pneumococcal", "Poisoning", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Respiratory Mucosa", "RNA, Messenger", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Welding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957970349", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55199562200": {"Name": "Suri R.", "AuthorID": "55199562200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203077928": {"Name": "Grigg J.", "AuthorID": "57203077928", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56325996300": {"Name": "Periselneris J.", "AuthorID": "56325996300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Department of Medicine, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Rayne Institute"}, "56304528100": {"Name": "Jose R.J.", "AuthorID": "56304528100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Department of Medicine, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Rayne Institute"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Department of Medicine, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Rayne Institute"}, "55959462400": {"Name": "Lanone S.", "AuthorID": "55959462400", "AffiliationID": "60015910, 60106700", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U955 \u00c9quipe 4, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine"}, "24330639100": {"Name": "Andujar P.", "AuthorID": "24330639100", "AffiliationID": "60015910, 60106700", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U955 \u00c9quipe 4, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine"}, "55071039500": {"Name": "Cohignac V.", "AuthorID": "55071039500", "AffiliationID": "60015910, 60106700", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U955 \u00c9quipe 4, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine"}, "36483815500": {"Name": "Zeidler-Erdely P.C.", "AuthorID": "36483815500", "AffiliationID": "60003103", "AffiliationName": "Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"}, "7006332343": {"Name": "Antonini J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006332343", "AffiliationID": "60003103", "AffiliationName": "Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"}, "6602700861": {"Name": "Erdely A.", "AuthorID": "6602700861", "AffiliationID": "60003103", "AffiliationName": "Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"}, "7006135493": {"Name": "Melton G.", "AuthorID": "7006135493", "AffiliationID": "60015726", "AffiliationName": "Welding Institute"}, "7202292837": {"Name": "Palmer K.T.", "AuthorID": "7202292837", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "6602889316": {"Name": "Mudway I.", "AuthorID": "6602889316", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, Analytical and Environmental Sciences Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}}}
