Although various methods have been developed to measure disease activity, there is still a lack of consensus about the optimal criteria for SLE remission. The principal aim of our study was to identify the number of lupus patients achieving a complete remission (implying that for 3 years there were no clinical or serologic features and no treatment with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs) in a single cohort of patients followed for a period of up to 32 years. In addition, we have identified patients in clinical but not serologic remission (known as serologically active, clinically quiescent disease [SACQ]) and vice versa. We were particularly interested to determine the factors associated with complete remission. Methods: Eligible patients were followed up in the University College Hospital Lupus cohort from January 1978 until December 2010 for a period of at least 3 years. Complete remission was defined as a period of at least 3 years with clinical inactivity (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group scores of C, D, or E only) and laboratory remission (no antibodies to double-stranded DNA and normal complement C3 levels), and being off-treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Antimalarial and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were allowed. Results: Of 624 lupus patients at our hospital, a total of 532 patients met the strict inclusion criteria for the study. Of these 532 patients, 77 patients (14.5%) achieved complete remission for at least 3 years, and 23 (4.3%) achieved complete remission for a minimum period of 10 years. Ten of these 77 patients were subsequently lost to followup, and, interestingly, flares occurred subsequently in 15 of the 67 remaining patients (22.4%). Three patients relapsed after the tenth year of remission. Forty-five patients (8.5%) fulfilled the requirement for SACQ, and 66 patients (12.4%) achieved only serologic remission. Conclusion: Our study indicated that 14.5% of lupus patients achieved a complete remission for 3 years. However, flares may continue to occur beyond 10 years of remission. Long-term followup of SLE is therefore mandatory.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976565546", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"55797298400": {"Name": "Medina-Qui\u00f1ones C.V.", "AuthorID": "55797298400", "AffiliationID": "60021609", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Ram\u00f3n y Cajal"}, "57204222411": {"Name": "Ramos-Merino L.", "AuthorID": "57204222411", "AffiliationID": "60023610", "AffiliationName": "Complejo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru\u00f1a"}, "55951681200": {"Name": "Ruiz-Sada P.", "AuthorID": "55951681200", "AffiliationID": "60015927", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario de Basurto"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
