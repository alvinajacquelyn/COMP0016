It also is important to follow the slowly progressive visual field defects many patients with ODD experience. The introduction of enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) has improved the visualization of more deeply buried ODD. There is, however, no consensus regarding the diagnosis of ODD using OCT. The purpose of this study was to develop a consensus recommendation for diagnosing ODD using OCT. Methods: The members of the Optic Disc Drusen Studies (ODDS) Consortium are either fellowship trained neuro-ophthalmologists with an interest in ODD, or researchers with an interest in ODD. Four standardization steps were performed by the consortium members with a focus on both image acquisition and diagnosis of ODD. Results: Based on prior knowledge and experiences from the standardization steps, the ODDS Consortium reached a consensus regarding OCT acquisition and diagnosis of ODD. The recommendations from the ODDS Consortiuminclude scanning protocol, data selection, data analysis, and nomenclature. Conclusions: The ODDS Consortium recommendations are important in the process of establishing a reliable and consistent diagnosis of ODD using OCT for both clinicians and researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Congresses as Topic", "Consensus", "Humans", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Disk", "Optic Disk Drusen", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055615359", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56058092700": {"Name": "Malmqvist L.", "AuthorID": "56058092700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "16481689800": {"Name": "Wegener M.", "AuthorID": "16481689800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7006721150": {"Name": "Hamann S.", "AuthorID": "7006721150", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "15135171400": {"Name": "Bursztyn L.", "AuthorID": "15135171400", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Western University"}, "57212524665": {"Name": "Fraser J.A.", "AuthorID": "57212524665", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University"}, "7003884162": {"Name": "Costello F.", "AuthorID": "7003884162", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical Neurosciences and Surgery, University of Calgary"}, "7005426922": {"Name": "Digre K.", "AuthorID": "7005426922", "AffiliationID": "60012445, 60025488", "AffiliationName": "John A.
