It is commonly accepted that the pulse shape at the heart of the Hilbert pair used to generate the required orthogonal signal spaces should be the square-root raised cosine. In this paper, we introduce two additional candidate pulse shapes, namely the first csv pulse and the so-called better-than-Nyquist pulse. We demonstrate experimentally that the better-than-Nyquist pulse offers superior bit-error rate performance compared to the square-root raised cosine and Xia pulses under additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions, while offering lower computational complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation", "digital signal processing", "modulation formats", "pulse shaping", "visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additive white Gaussian noise channel", "Amplitude and phase modulations", "Bit error rate (BER) performance", "Modulation formats", "Nyquist pulse", "Nyquist pulse shape", "Orthogonal signals", "Square root raised cosine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052882664", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Innovations Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zv\u00e1novec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}}}
