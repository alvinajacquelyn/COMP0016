Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Jmjd2 H3K9 demethylases cooperate in promoting mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity. However, little is known about their importance at the exit of ESC pluripotency. Here, we reveal that Jmjd2c facilitates this process by stabilising the assembly of mediator-cohesin complexes at lineage-specific enhancers. Functionally, we show that Jmjd2c is required in ESCs to initiate appropriate gene expression programs upon somatic multi-lineage differentiation. In the absence of Jmjd2c, differentiation is stalled at an early post-implantation epiblast-like stage, while Jmjd2c-knockout ESCs remain capable of forming extra-embryonic endoderm derivatives. Dissection of the underlying molecular basis revealed that Jmjd2c is re-distributed to lineage-specific enhancers during ESC priming for differentiation. Interestingly, Jmjd2c-bound enhancers are co-occupied by the H3K9-methyltransferase G9a (also known as Ehmt2), independently of its H3K9-modifying activity. Loss of Jmjd2c abrogates G9a recruitment and further destabilises loading of the mediator and cohesin components Med1 and Smc1a at newly activated and poised enhancers in ESC-derived epiblast-like cells. These findings unveil Jmjd2c and G9a as novel enhancerassociated factors, and implicate Jmjd2c as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of essential enhancer-protein complexes with an impact on timely gene activation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embryonic stem cells", "Enhancers", "Epiblast stem cells", "Gene regulation", "Jmjd2c (Kdm4c)", "Lineage specification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Germ Layers", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Histones", "Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Protein Binding", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012969568", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"36097186300": {"Name": "Tomaz R.A.", "AuthorID": "36097186300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57193325684": {"Name": "Karimlou D.", "AuthorID": "57193325684", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56955055700": {"Name": "Weavers L.", "AuthorID": "56955055700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "37000541800": {"Name": "Bou-Kheir T.", "AuthorID": "37000541800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57213479709": {"Name": "Bell E.", "AuthorID": "57213479709", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "55444127200": {"Name": "Curry E.", "AuthorID": "55444127200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6603237421": {"Name": "Azuara V.", "AuthorID": "6603237421", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57192267728": {"Name": "Harman J.L.", "AuthorID": "57192267728", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7202554499": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen H.F.", "AuthorID": "7202554499", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "6602547701": {"Name": "Fritsch L.", "AuthorID": "6602547701", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS - Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Epigenetics and Cell Fate, UMR 7216 CNRS"}, "6701718396": {"Name": "Ait-Si-Ali S.", "AuthorID": "6701718396", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS - Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Epigenetics and Cell Fate, UMR 7216 CNRS"}, "57193326047": {"Name": "del Valle Torres I.", "AuthorID": "57193326047", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Human Embryo and Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "8869520500": {"Name": "Niakan K.K.", "AuthorID": "8869520500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Human Embryo and Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57191952815": {"Name": "Fisher C.", "AuthorID": "57191952815", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "56785782000": {"Name": "Joshi O.", "AuthorID": "56785782000", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University, Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology"}, "7006024572": {"Name": "Stunnenberg H.G.", "AuthorID": "7006024572", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University, Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology"}}}
