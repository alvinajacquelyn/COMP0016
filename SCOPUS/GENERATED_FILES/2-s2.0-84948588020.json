Allrightsreserved.In this paper we introduce a new symbolicsemantics for a class of recursive programs which feature dynamic creation and unbounded allocation of objects. We use a symbolic representation of the program state in terms of equations to model the semantics of a program as a pushdown system with a finiteset of control states and a finitestack alphabet. Our main technical result is a rigorous proof of the equivalence between the concrete and the symbolic semantics. Adding pointer fields gives rise to a Turing complete language. However, under the assumption that the number of reachable objects in the visible heap is bounded in all the computations of a program with pointers, we show how to construct a program without pointers that simulates it. Consequently, in the context of bounded visible heaps, programs with pointers are no more expressive than programs without them. We conclude by extending programs with a dynamic deallocation statement, an operation that affects all aliases of a deallocated object. We show how to extend the concrete and the symbolic semantics so to retain the previous equivalence result.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Heap structures", "Object-oriented program semantics", "Pushdown system"], "IndexKeywords": ["De-allocation", "Object-oriented program", "Program state", "Pushdown systems", "Recursive programs", "Symbolic representation", "Symbolic semantics", "Turing-complete"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948588020", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55560517200": {"Name": "De Boer F.", "AuthorID": "55560517200", "AffiliationID": "113903297", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)"}, "6701786379": {"Name": "Bonsangue M.", "AuthorID": "6701786379", "AffiliationID": "113903297", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)"}, "55305790900": {"Name": "Rot J.", "AuthorID": "55305790900", "AffiliationID": "113903297", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)"}}}
