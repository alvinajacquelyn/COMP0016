An alumina loading of 35 vol% in the presence of 1.25 wt% superplasticizer was established to be suitable for lathing and removal of significant amount of material through drilling. A reduction of 77% in the diameter of green bodies that corresponds to a 59% reduction in volume was achieved. The lathed green bodies exhibited smooth terraces without visible cracks. All of the green bodies were sintered without a polymer burnout step.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alumina", "Green body", "Rheology/rheometry", "Solid casting", "Suspensions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alumina loading", "Green body", "Polymer burnout", "Rheology modifiers", "Superplasticizers", "Visible cracks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949024124", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57201468830": {"Name": "Avci G.", "AuthorID": "57201468830", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University"}, "56717764100": {"Name": "Akhlaghi O.", "AuthorID": "56717764100", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University"}, "55874858200": {"Name": "Ustbas B.", "AuthorID": "55874858200", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University"}, "56989594700": {"Name": "Ozbay C.", "AuthorID": "56989594700", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University"}, "6603383012": {"Name": "Menceloglu Y.Z.", "AuthorID": "6603383012", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University"}, "15724173000": {"Name": "Akbulut O.", "AuthorID": "15724173000", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University"}}}
