We use administrative data for England to estimate the effect of attending a selective boarding school that admits an unusually high share of pupils with low socio-economic status on attainment at the end of compulsory education. By using propensity score matching we obtain comparable control groups in selective non-boarding schools. Our main finding is that the probability of being in the top decile of achievement in the exams increases by about 18 percentage points compared to 59% for controls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ability", "Achievement gap", "Boarding", "Education", "GCSE", "Grammar school", "Private school", "SES", "Socio-economic status"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070645183", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"24385557500": {"Name": "Foliano F.", "AuthorID": "24385557500", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "35467454700": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "35467454700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, Department of Education, Practice and Society"}, "57110388700": {"Name": "Sartarelli M.", "AuthorID": "57110388700", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, An\u00e1lisis Econ\u00f3mico y Econom\u00eda Cuantitativa"}}}
