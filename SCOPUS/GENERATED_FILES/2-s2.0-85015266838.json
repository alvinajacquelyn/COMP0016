Less frequent and lower dose scheduling may be used with sibling donors, but an optimal regimen for matched unrelated donors has not been defined. In this retrospective observational study of 313 patients, the incidence and severity of GVHD was compared in patients receiving 3 different dose schedules: the standard 100-mg regimen (20 mg on days \u20137 to \u20133), 60 mg (30 mg on days \u20134 and \u20132), or 50 mg (10 mg on days \u20137 to \u20133). Patients treated with 100 mg, 60 mg, or 50 mg developed acute GVHD grades I to IV with an incidence of 74%, 65%, and 64%, respectively, whereas 36%, 32%, and 41% developed chronic GHVD. An excess of severe acute grades III/IV GVHD was observed in the 50-mg cohort (15% versus 2% to 6%; P = .016). The relative risk of severe acute grade GVHD remained more than 3-fold higher in the 50-mg cohort compared with the 100-mg cohort after adjustment for differences in HLA match, age, gender mismatch, cytomegalovirus risk, and diagnosis (P = .030). The findings indicate that the 60-mg alemtuzumab schedule was comparable with the 100-mg schedule, but more attenuated schedules may increase the risk of severe grade GVHD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alemtuzumab", "Conditioning regimens", "Graft-versus-host disease", "T cell depletion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alemtuzumab", "Allografts", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Male", "Melphalan", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Unrelated Donors", "Vidarabine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015266838", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"56344158600": {"Name": "Green K.", "AuthorID": "56344158600", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7005600214": {"Name": "Pearce K.", "AuthorID": "7005600214", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "37109901500": {"Name": "Jardine L.", "AuthorID": "37109901500", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Northern Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193206030": {"Name": "Bigley V.", "AuthorID": "57193206030", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Northern Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202325871": {"Name": "Dickinson A.M.", "AuthorID": "7202325871", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7005808086": {"Name": "Collin M.", "AuthorID": "7005808086", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Northern Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35757123400": {"Name": "Sellar R.S.", "AuthorID": "35757123400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56179054100": {"Name": "Thomson K.", "AuthorID": "56179054100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202865272": {"Name": "Mackinnon S.", "AuthorID": "7202865272", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.S.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56596067800": {"Name": "Jackson G.", "AuthorID": "56596067800", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University"}, "55894954600": {"Name": "Nicolson P.L.R.", "AuthorID": "55894954600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7005603726": {"Name": "Craddock C.", "AuthorID": "7005603726", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36090075800": {"Name": "Nagra S.", "AuthorID": "36090075800", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
