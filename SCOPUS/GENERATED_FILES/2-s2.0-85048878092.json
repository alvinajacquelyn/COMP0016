However, there is still limited available data on the efficiency and reliability of this method. Results: We generated conditional mouse alleles using lssDNA donor templates and performed extensive characterization of the resulting mutations. We observed that the use of lssDNA molecules as donors efficiently yielded founders bearing the conditional allele, with seven out of nine projects giving rise to modified alleles. However, rearranged alleles including nucleotide changes, indels, local rearrangements and additional integrations were also frequently generated by this method. Specifically, we found that alleles containing unexpected point mutations were found in three of the nine projects analyzed. Alleles originating from illegitimate repairs or partial integration of the donor were detected in eight projects. Furthermore, additional integrations of donor molecules were identified in four out of the seven projects analyzed by copy counting. This highlighted the requirement for a thorough allele validation by polymerase chain reaction, sequencing and copy counting of the mice generated through this method. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using lssDNA donors to generate thus far problematic point mutations distant from active CRISPR cutting sites by targeting two distinct genes (Gckr and Rims1). We propose a strategy to perform extensive quality control and validation of both types of mouse models generated using lssDNA donors. Conclusion: lssDNA donors reproducibly generate conditional alleles and can be used to introduce point mutations away from CRISPR/Cas9 cutting sites in mice. However, our work demonstrates that thorough quality control of new models is essential prior to reliably experimenting with mice generated by this method. These advances in genome editing techniques shift the challenge of mutagenesis from generation to the validation of new mutant models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allele validation", "Conditional", "CRISPR/Cas9", "Homologous recombination", "Long single-stranded DNA", "Mouse", "Mutant"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Animals", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "DNA, Single-Stranded", "Gene Editing", "Gene Targeting", "Mice", "Mutation", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048878092", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57168856100": {"Name": "Codner G.F.", "AuthorID": "57168856100", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57112544000": {"Name": "Miann\u00e9 J.", "AuthorID": "57112544000", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57190745477": {"Name": "Caulder A.", "AuthorID": "57190745477", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57196043802": {"Name": "Loeffler J.", "AuthorID": "57196043802", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57196466942": {"Name": "Fell R.", "AuthorID": "57196466942", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57190805268": {"Name": "King R.", "AuthorID": "57190805268", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57202609002": {"Name": "Allan A.J.", "AuthorID": "57202609002", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57202610534": {"Name": "Mackenzie M.", "AuthorID": "57202610534", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57202601070": {"Name": "Pike F.J.", "AuthorID": "57202601070", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57202602095": {"Name": "McCabe C.V.", "AuthorID": "57202602095", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57194429959": {"Name": "Christou S.", "AuthorID": "57194429959", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57193911484": {"Name": "Joynson S.", "AuthorID": "57193911484", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "55574599000": {"Name": "Hutchison M.", "AuthorID": "55574599000", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "54912692900": {"Name": "Stewart M.E.", "AuthorID": "54912692900", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57197474223": {"Name": "Wells S.", "AuthorID": "57197474223", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "6602721106": {"Name": "Teboul L.", "AuthorID": "6602721106", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "The Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "56088126300": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "56088126300", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "Mammalian Genetics Unit, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "55356989200": {"Name": "Simon M.M.", "AuthorID": "55356989200", "AffiliationID": "114272750", "AffiliationName": "Mammalian Genetics Unit, MRC Harwell Institute"}, "57209788403": {"Name": "Agius L.", "AuthorID": "57209788403", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University, Institute of Cellular Medicine and Ageing and Health"}, "12781808200": {"Name": "Anstee Q.M.", "AuthorID": "12781808200", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University, Institute of Cellular Medicine and Ageing and Health"}, "6603211980": {"Name": "Volynski K.E.", "AuthorID": "6603211980", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
