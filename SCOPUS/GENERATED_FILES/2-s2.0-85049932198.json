Whilst speech perception may develop for many years after implant activation, very little is known about the changes in auditory processing that underpin these improvements. Such an understanding could help guide interventions that improve hearing performance. In this longitudinal study, we examine how electrode discrimination ability changes over time in newly implanted adult CI users. Electrode discrimination was measured with a behavioural task as well as the spatial auditory change complex (ACC), which is a cortical response to a change in place of stimulation. We show that there was significant improvement in electrode discrimination ability over time, though in certain individuals the process of accommodation was slower and more limited. We found a strong relationship between objective and behavioural measures of electrode discrimination using pass-fail rules. In several cases, the development of the spatial ACC preceded accurate behavioural discrimination. These data provide evidence for plasticity of auditory processing in adult CI users. Behavioural electrode discrimination score but not spatial ACC amplitude was found to be a significant predictor of speech perception. We suggest that it would be beneficial to measure electrode discrimination in CI users and that interventions that exploit the plastic capacity of the auditory system to improve basic auditory processing, could be used to optimize performance in CI users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACC", "Auditory change complex", "Auditory plasticity", "Cochlear implant", "Electrode discrimination", "Objective measures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Auditory Pathways", "Cochlear Implantation", "Cochlear Implants", "Deafness", "Electric Stimulation", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Hearing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Speech Perception", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049932198", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"14622805300": {"Name": "Mathew R.", "AuthorID": "14622805300", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St Georges Hospital NHS Trust"}, "36198983500": {"Name": "Undurraga J.", "AuthorID": "36198983500", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University"}, "7006164240": {"Name": "Vickers D.", "AuthorID": "7006164240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences Department"}, "35236315900": {"Name": "Boyle P.", "AuthorID": "35236315900", "AffiliationID": "100518520", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Bionics GmbH"}, "6602320456": {"Name": "Shaida A.", "AuthorID": "6602320456", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "24597870400": {"Name": "Selvadurai D.", "AuthorID": "24597870400", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St Georges Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7401574526": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "7401574526", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guys and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust"}}}
