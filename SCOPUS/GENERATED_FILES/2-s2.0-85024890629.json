Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Impaired vision", "Infra-red light", "Neuro-ophthalmology", "Optic nerve lesions", "Optical coherence tomography", "Vein occlusions", "Visual field defects", "Visual loss"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024890629", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005662177": {"Name": "Acheson J.", "AuthorID": "7005662177", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003310677": {"Name": "Bremner F.", "AuthorID": "7003310677", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202160081": {"Name": "Graham E.", "AuthorID": "7202160081", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403674316": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "7403674316", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203026074": {"Name": "Plant G.", "AuthorID": "57203026074", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216595043": {"Name": "Leff A.", "AuthorID": "57216595043", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7101797716": {"Name": "Shorvon S.", "AuthorID": "7101797716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "6602459234": {"Name": "Toosy A.", "AuthorID": "6602459234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}}}
