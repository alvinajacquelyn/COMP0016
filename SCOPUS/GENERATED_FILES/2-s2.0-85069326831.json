Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging and D2/3R positron emission tomography in 51 healthy volunteers, to investigate the relationship between working memory performance, task- induced default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity changes, and striatal D2/3R availability. Increasing working memory load was associated with reduced DMN functional connectivity, which was itself associated with poorer task performance. Crucially, the magnitude of the DMN connectivity reduction correlated with striatal D2/3R availability, particularly in the caudate, and this relationship mediated the relationship between striatal D2/3R availability and task performance. These results inform our understanding of natural variation in working memory performance, and have implications for understanding age-related cognitive decline and cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders where dopamine signalling is altered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Corpus Striatum", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069326831", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56785597500": {"Name": "Nour M.M.", "AuthorID": "56785597500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging (WCHN), University College London"}, "55681272600": {"Name": "McCutcheon R.A.", "AuthorID": "55681272600", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Hammersmith Hospital"}, "6602176923": {"Name": "Howes O.D.", "AuthorID": "6602176923", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "57199081751": {"Name": "Dahoun T.", "AuthorID": "57199081751", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7403935120": {"Name": "Adams R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403935120", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "12781654600": {"Name": "Wall M.B.", "AuthorID": "12781654600", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60109255", "AffiliationName": "Imanova Centre for Imaging Sciences (Invicro Ltd), Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
