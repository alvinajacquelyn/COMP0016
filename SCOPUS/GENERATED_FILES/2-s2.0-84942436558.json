The pathogenesis of IPF is uncertain, but loss of epithelial cells and fibroblast proliferation are thought to be central processes. Previous reports have shown that BARD1 expression is upregulated in response to hypoxia and associated with TGF-\u03b2 signaling, both recognized factors driving lung fibrosis. Differentially spliced BARD1 isoforms, in particular BARD1\u03b2, are oncogenic drivers of proliferation in cancers of various origins. We therefore hypothesized that BARD1 and/or its isoforms might play a role in lung fibrosis. Methods: We investigated BARD1 expression as a function of TGF-\u03b2 in cultured cells, in mice with experimentally induced lung fibrosis, and in lung biopsies from pulmonary fibrosis patients. Results: FL BARD1 and BARD1\u03b2 were upregulated in response to TGF-\u03b2 in epithelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. Protein and mRNA expression studies showed very low expression in healthy lung tissues, but upregulated expression of full length (FL) BARD1 and BARD1\u03b2 in fibrotic tissues. Conclusion: Our data suggest that FL BARD1 and BARD1\u03b2 might be mediators of pleiotropic effects of TGF-\u03b2. In particular BARD1\u03b2 might be a driver of proliferation and of pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis and progression and represent a target for treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "BARD1", "Differential splicing", "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)", "Lung fibrosis", "Proliferation", "TGF-\u03b2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Bleomycin", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Lung", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Protein Isoforms", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942436558", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57217399132": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9 P.A.", "AuthorID": "57217399132", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic and Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals"}, "6701724659": {"Name": "Irminger-Finger I.", "AuthorID": "6701724659", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60005202, 60009834, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research"}, "6507419393": {"Name": "Pr\u00eale C.M.", "AuthorID": "6507419393", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60005202, 60009834, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research"}, "7201921559": {"Name": "Laurent G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201921559", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60005202, 60009834, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research"}, "45161927500": {"Name": "Vierkotten S.", "AuthorID": "45161927500", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60024007, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Pneumology Center Ludwig Maximilians University, University Hospital Grosshadern and Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen"}, "23028319700": {"Name": "K\u00f6nigshoff M.", "AuthorID": "23028319700", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60024007, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Pneumology Center Ludwig Maximilians University, University Hospital Grosshadern and Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen"}, "6603253410": {"Name": "Carnesecchi S.", "AuthorID": "6603253410", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Pathology Immunology, University of Geneva"}, "6701459373": {"Name": "Donati Y.", "AuthorID": "6701459373", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Pathology Immunology, University of Geneva"}, "55667090500": {"Name": "Barazzone-Argiroffo C.", "AuthorID": "55667090500", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Pathology Immunology, University of Geneva"}, "35478426700": {"Name": "Chambers R.C.", "AuthorID": "35478426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, University College London"}, "7004647681": {"Name": "Pache J.C.", "AuthorID": "7004647681", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pathology, Geneva University Hospitals"}, "14007929800": {"Name": "Crestani B.", "AuthorID": "14007929800", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60123796, 60022785", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, Unit\u00e9 1152, University of Paris Diderot and Hopital Bichat"}}}
