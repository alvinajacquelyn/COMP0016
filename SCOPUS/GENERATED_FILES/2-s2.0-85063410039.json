This unique disorder includes early infantile onset refractory epilepsy, hypotonia, developmental intellectual and motor disabilities, and cortical visual impairment. We review the clinical presentations and genetic variations in CDD based on a systematic literature review and experience in the CDKL5 Centers of Excellence. We propose minimum diagnostic criteria. Pathogenic variants include deletions, truncations, splice variants, and missense variants. Pathogenic missense variants occur exclusively within the kinase domain or affect splice sites. The CDKL5 protein is widely expressed in the brain, predominantly in neurons, with roles in cell proliferation, neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth, dendritic morphogenesis, and synapse development. The molecular biology of CDD is revealing opportunities in precision therapy, with phase 2 and 3 clinical trials underway or planned to assess disease specific and disease modifying treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CDKL5 deficiency disorder", "Clinical trials", "Developmental encephalopathy", "Epilepsy genetics", "Epileptic encephalopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative Splicing", "Anticonvulsants", "Corpus Callosum", "Developmental Disabilities", "Diet, Ketogenic", "Electroencephalography", "Epileptic Syndromes", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Movement Disorders", "Mutation", "Precision Medicine", "Protein Conformation", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Spasms, Infantile", "Vagus Nerve Stimulation", "Vision Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063410039", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"41562009700": {"Name": "Olson H.E.", "AuthorID": "41562009700", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology, Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "55796275600": {"Name": "Swanson L.C.", "AuthorID": "55796275600", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology, Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "56091095500": {"Name": "Demarest S.T.", "AuthorID": "56091095500", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, School of Medicine"}, "7005038976": {"Name": "Benke T.A.", "AuthorID": "7005038976", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Colorado, School of Medicine"}, "25030807200": {"Name": "Pestana-Knight E.M.", "AuthorID": "25030807200", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute Epilepsy Center, Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute Pediatric Neurology Department, Neurogenetics, Cleveland Clinic Children's"}, "35183110800": {"Name": "Iqbal S.", "AuthorID": "35183110800", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "55555115200": {"Name": "Lal D.", "AuthorID": "55555115200", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic"}, "7005060426": {"Name": "Leonard H.", "AuthorID": "7005060426", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street NIHR BRC Institute of Child Health"}, "7102688352": {"Name": "Devinsky O.", "AuthorID": "7102688352", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, NYU Langone Health"}}}
