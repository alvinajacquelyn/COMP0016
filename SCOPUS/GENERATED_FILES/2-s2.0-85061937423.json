Methods: We performed a retrospective multi-centre cohort study focussing on the histopathological features of patients with MH or RM due to RYR1 mutations (1987\u20132017). All muscle biopsies were reviewed by a neuromuscular pathologist. Additional morphometric and electron microscopic analysis were performed where possible. Results: Through the six participating centres we identified 50 patients from 46 families, including patients with MH (n = 31) and RM (n = 19). Overall, the biopsy of 90% of patients showed one or more myopathic features including: increased fibre size variability (n = 44), increase in the number of fibres with internal nuclei (n = 30), and type I fibre predominance (n = 13). Abnormalities on oxidative staining, generally considered to be more specifically associated with RYR1-related congenital myopathies, were observed in 52%, and included unevenness (n = 24), central cores (n = 7) and multi-minicores (n = 3). Apart from oxidative staining abnormalities more frequently observed in MH patients, the histopathological spectrum was similar between the two groups. There was no correlation between the presence of cores and the occurrence of clinically detectable weakness or presence of (likely) pathogenic variants. Conclusions: Patients with RYR1-related MH and RM exhibit a similar histopathological spectrum, ranging from mild myopathic changes to cores and other features typical of RYR1-related congenital myopathies. Suggestive histopathological features may support RYR1 involvement, also in cases where the in vitro contracture test is not informative.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Histology", "Malignant hyperthermia (MH)", "Muscle biopsy", "Rhabdomyolysis", "RYR1", "RyR1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Malignant Hyperthermia", "Middle Aged", "Muscles", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Retrospective Studies", "Rhabdomyolysis", "Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061937423", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54884013000": {"Name": "Knuiman G.J.", "AuthorID": "54884013000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "6601989464": {"Name": "K\u00fcsters B.", "AuthorID": "6601989464", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "6503986037": {"Name": "Eshuis L.", "AuthorID": "6503986037", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "7003977381": {"Name": "Snoeck M.", "AuthorID": "7003977381", "AffiliationID": "60028304", "AffiliationName": "National MH Investigation Unit, Department of Anaesthesiology, Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital"}, "7005630229": {"Name": "Lammens M.", "AuthorID": "7005630229", "AffiliationID": "60013703, 60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, University of Antwerp"}, "7003269137": {"Name": "Heytens L.", "AuthorID": "7003269137", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Malignant Hyperthermia Research Unit, University of Antwerp"}, "56380351900": {"Name": "De Ridder W.", "AuthorID": "56380351900", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuromuscular Reference Centre, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "23994966100": {"Name": "Baets J.", "AuthorID": "23994966100", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuromuscular Reference Centre, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "55343433000": {"Name": "Scalco R.S.", "AuthorID": "55343433000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55367947400": {"Name": "Bodi I.", "AuthorID": "55367947400", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Neuromuscular Service, Evelina Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602766584": {"Name": "Wraige E.", "AuthorID": "6602766584", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Neuromuscular Service, Evelina Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006738404": {"Name": "Jungbluth H.", "AuthorID": "7006738404", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King\u2019s College, IoPPN"}, "55791416200": {"Name": "Radunovic A.", "AuthorID": "55791416200", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Barts Neuromuscular Diseases Centre, Royal London Hospital"}, "57206722736": {"Name": "von Landenberg C.", "AuthorID": "57206722736", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Muscle Lab, Department of Neurology, University of Bonn Medical Centre"}, "7102961802": {"Name": "Reimann J.", "AuthorID": "7102961802", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Muscle Lab, Department of Neurology, University of Bonn Medical Centre"}, "6603436473": {"Name": "Kamsteeg E.J.", "AuthorID": "6603436473", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "7006776367": {"Name": "Sewry C.", "AuthorID": "7006776367", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57203226094": {"Name": "Voermans N.C.", "AuthorID": "57203226094", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}}}
