We analysed data from five sources. One contraceptive service provider reported a 10% increase in attendance during the main Games, while emergency contraception prescriptions rose during the main Olympics, compared to the week before, but were similar or lower than at the beginning and end of the summer period. A health telephone advice line reported a 16% fall in sexual health-related calls during the main Olympics, but a 33% increase subsequently. London sexual assault referral centres reported that 1.8% of sexual assaults were Olympics-linked. A service for sex workers reported that 16% started working in the sex industry and 7% moved to London to work during the Olympics. Fifty-eight per cent and 45% of sex workers reported fewer clients and an increase in police crack-downs, respectively. Our results show a change in activity across these services during the 2012 summer, which may be associated with the Olympics. Our data are a guide to other services when anticipating changes in service activity and planning staffing for mass-gathering events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contraception", "London 2012", "mass-gathering event", "Olympic", "sex worker", "sexual assault referral centre", "sexual health", "telephone advice line"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Contraception, Postcoital", "Family Planning Services", "Humans", "London", "Prostitution", "Referral and Consultation", "Reproductive Health", "Sex Offenses", "Sexual Behavior", "Sports"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925260766", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"37099757900": {"Name": "Hartley A.", "AuthorID": "37099757900", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Infection and Immunity Department, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56562410500": {"Name": "Foster R.", "AuthorID": "56562410500", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Jefferiss Wing Centre for Sexual Health, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7101669130": {"Name": "Brook M.", "AuthorID": "7101669130", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "GU Medicine, Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57203069305": {"Name": "Cassell J.", "AuthorID": "57203069305", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care & Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London"}, "35611609400": {"Name": "Coyne K.", "AuthorID": "35611609400", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Homerton University Hospital"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "7006447478": {"Name": "Crook P.", "AuthorID": "7006447478", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Epidemiology Services, Public Health England"}}}
