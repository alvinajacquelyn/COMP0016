Statistical regularities can be efficiently exploited to overcome the limitations of the inherently incomplete knowledge bases distributed across the Web. This paper focuses on the problem of predicting missing class-memberships and property values of individual resources in Web ontologies. We propose a transductive inference method for inferring missing properties about individuals: given a classmembership/property value learning problem, we address the task of identifying relations which are likely to link similar individuals, and efficiently propagating knowledge across such (possibly diverse) relations. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental evaluation", "Incomplete knowledge", "Knowledge propagation", "Machine learning methods", "Similar individuals", "Standard reasoning", "Statistical regularity", "Transductive inference"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84914145772", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36617521100": {"Name": "Minervini P.", "AuthorID": "36617521100", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}, "49861247200": {"Name": "D\u2019amato C.", "AuthorID": "49861247200", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}, "6602096916": {"Name": "Fanizzi N.", "AuthorID": "6602096916", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}, "35502785400": {"Name": "Esposito F.", "AuthorID": "35502785400", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}}}
