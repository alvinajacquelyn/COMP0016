In this paper, we describe how external data for the third year of before/after evaluation from Scotland's National Naloxone Programme, a related public health policy, were anticipated by eliciting prior opinion about the Scottish results in the month prior to their release as official statistics. We summarise how deliberations by the N-ALIVE Trial Steering-Data Monitoring Committee (TS-DMC) on N-ALIVE's own interim data, together with those on naloxone-on-release (NOR) from Scotland, led to the decision to cease randomization in the N-ALIVE pilot trial and recommend to local Principal Investigators that NOR be offered to already-randomized prisoners who had not yet been released.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causality", "Cessation", "Data Monitoring Committee", "Elicitation", "External evidence", "Randomized pilot trial"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012309103", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7201459524": {"Name": "Bird S.M.", "AuthorID": "7201459524", "AffiliationID": "60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit"}, "7102963151": {"Name": "Strang J.", "AuthorID": "7102963151", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, King's College London"}, "26425387600": {"Name": "Ashby D.", "AuthorID": "26425387600", "AffiliationID": "60020413", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Clinical Trials Unit School of Public Health"}, "57191764607": {"Name": "Podmore J.", "AuthorID": "57191764607", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Durham University School of Applied Social Sciences"}, "7404531268": {"Name": "Robertson J.R.", "AuthorID": "7404531268", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh University Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics"}, "57217351555": {"Name": "Welch S.", "AuthorID": "57217351555", "AffiliationID": "118089223", "AffiliationName": "Turning Point"}, "16835191900": {"Name": "Meade A.M.", "AuthorID": "16835191900", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "57206147296": {"Name": "Parmar M.K.B.", "AuthorID": "57206147296", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}}}
