Creativity theories have tended to concentrate, however, on creativity as an individual phenomenon that results in a novel production, and on cognitive aspects of creativity, often limiting its applicability to people with cognitive impairments, including those with a dementia. Despite growing indications that creativity is important for the wellbeing of people living with dementias, it is less well understood how creativity might be conceptualised, measured and recognised in this population, and how this understanding could influence research and practise. This paper begins by exploring prevailing concepts of creativity and assesses their relevance to dementia, followed by a critique of creativity and dementia research related to the arts. Perspectives from researchers, artists, formal and informal caregivers and those with a dementia are addressed. We then introduce several novel psychological and physiological approaches to better understand artistic-related creativity in this population and conclude with a conceptualisation of artistic creativity in the dementias to help guide future research and practise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Creativity", "Dance", "Dementia", "Music", "Poetry", "Psychophysiology", "Visual art"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054345509", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"35267762400": {"Name": "Camic P.", "AuthorID": "35267762400", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203712937": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "57203712937", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Created Out of Mind, Wellcome Collection"}, "55427366700": {"Name": "Firth N.", "AuthorID": "55427366700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57189730521": {"Name": "Harding E.", "AuthorID": "57189730521", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203200940": {"Name": "Harrison C.", "AuthorID": "57203200940", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Created Out of Mind, Wellcome Collection"}, "57200078663": {"Name": "Howard S.", "AuthorID": "57200078663", "AffiliationID": "119978295", "AffiliationName": "Living Words"}, "57204072174": {"Name": "Strohmaier S.", "AuthorID": "57204072174", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "57204072336": {"Name": "Van Leewen J.", "AuthorID": "57204072336", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57193585483": {"Name": "West J.", "AuthorID": "57193585483", "AffiliationID": "60105353", "AffiliationName": "Royal Academy of Music"}, "12243150500": {"Name": "Windle G.", "AuthorID": "12243150500", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Services Development Centre, Bangor University"}, "19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55091148900": {"Name": "Zeilig H.", "AuthorID": "55091148900", "AffiliationID": "60021764", "AffiliationName": "College of Fashion, University of the Arts London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
