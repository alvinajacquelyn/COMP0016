Here, we designed a cyclometalated platinum (II) complex that can bind the endogenous nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) protein. Employing detailed colocalization studies in co-culture cell line models, we show that by binding to NF-\u03baB, the platinum (II) complex is capable of upregulated nuclear translocation specifically in cancer but not normal cells, thereby impairing cancer proliferation without disturbing healthy cells. In a murine tumour model, the platinum (II) complex prevents tumour growth to a greater extent than cisplatin and with considerably lower side-effects and kidney damage. Considering its weak damage to normal cells combined with high toxicity to cancer cells, this NF-\u03baB-binding platinum complex is a potential anti-cancer candidate and acts to verify the strategy of hijacking endogenous trans-nuclear proteins to achieve cancer-cell specificity and enhance therapeutic indices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer therapy", "Nuclear factor kappa B", "Platinum complex", "Theranostic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Survival", "Disease Models, Animal", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Neoplasms", "NF-kappa B p50 Subunit", "Platinum Compounds", "Protein Binding", "Theranostic Nanomedicine", "Transplantation, Heterologous", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066852468", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"]], "AuthorData": {"55819232200": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "55819232200", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University"}, "57192229436": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "57192229436", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University"}, "36674322400": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "36674322400", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University"}, "55520158700": {"Name": "Zhou H.", "AuthorID": "55520158700", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University"}, "8318570600": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "8318570600", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University"}, "7402840786": {"Name": "Tian Y.", "AuthorID": "7402840786", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University"}, "40561700700": {"Name": "Tian X.", "AuthorID": "40561700700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55647084400": {"Name": "Luo L.", "AuthorID": "55647084400", "AffiliationID": "60122052", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University"}, "57212680283": {"Name": "Gill M.R.", "AuthorID": "57212680283", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57205682648": {"Name": "De Pace C.", "AuthorID": "57205682648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
