All rights reserved.This study assessed the effect of endocrine input on the investigation of hyponatraemia and examined the prevalence of endocrine causes of hyponatraemia. This single-centre, retrospective study included 139 inpatients (median age, 74 years) with serum sodium (Na) levels \u2264128 mmol/l during hospitalisation at a UK teaching hospital over a three-month period. In total, 61.9% of patients underwent assessment of volume status and 28.8% had paired serum and urine osmolality, and Na measured. In addition, 14.4% of patients received endocrine input; 80% of these patients underwent full work-up of hyponatraemia compared with 5% of patients not referred to endocrine services (p<0.001; relative risk, 15.86; 95% confidence interval, 7.17-31.06). The prevalence of adrenal insufficiency was 0.7%, but basal serum cortisol levels were not measured in around two-thirds of patients. Despite 26.7% of patients having abnormal thyroid function tests, no patient was diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism. More widespread provision of expert input should be considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hyponatraemia", "Inappropriate ADH syndrome", "Investigation", "Sodium", "Vasopressin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Hyponatremia", "Inappropriate ADH Syndrome", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Sodium", "Thyroid Function Tests", "Thyroxine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003054411", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56038154900": {"Name": "Tzoulis P.", "AuthorID": "56038154900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroendocrinology, Royal Free Campus, University College Medical School"}, "8783057300": {"Name": "Bouloux P.", "AuthorID": "8783057300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroendocrinology, Royal Free Campus, University College Medical School"}}}
