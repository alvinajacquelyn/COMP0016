It has sometimes been conceptualised as \u201cbehavioural effort\u201d to seek social contact. Two paradigms: approach\u2013avoidance (AA) and choose a movie (CAM), based on the same conceptualisation, have been used to measure social motivation in people with and without autism. However, in absence of a direct comparison, it is hard to know which of these paradigms has higher sensitivity in estimating preference for social over non-social stimuli. Here we compare these two tasks for their utility in (1) evaluating social seeking in typical people and (2) identifying the influence of autistic traits on social motivation. Our results suggest that CAM reveals a clear preference for social stimuli over non-social in typical adults but AA fails to do so. Also, social seeking measured with CAM but not AA has a negative relationship between autistic traits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Approach/avoidance", "Autistic traits", "Choose-a-movie (CAM)", "Social motivation", "Social seeking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033470579", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"35742796500": {"Name": "Dubey I.", "AuthorID": "35742796500", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "6602424245": {"Name": "Ropar D.", "AuthorID": "6602424245", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
