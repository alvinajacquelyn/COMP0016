This tool is useful in evaluating constructive systems composed by up to seven homogeneous layers and also constructive systems composed by one non-homogeneous layer plus up to six homogeneous layers. The non-homogeneous layer can be either filled or hollow block type. Ener-Habitat solves the time-dependent heat transfer equation with convective boundary conditions on both sides, in one-dimension for homogeneous constructive systems and in two-dimensions for constructive systems containing one non-homogeneous layer. It takes into consideration that the constructive system is either in a non air-conditioned room or in an air-conditioned one. The one-dimensional model for homogeneous multilayered constructive systems is validated by comparison with EnergyPlus results. The two-dimensional model is validated by calculating the heat transfer through a concrete hollow block wall in steady-state and the comparison with experimental results. Ener-Habitat is proved to be a reliable tool.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building envelope", "Online tool", "Simulation tool", "Thermal performance", "Time dependent", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building envelopes", "On-line tools", "Thermal Performance", "Time dependent", "Validation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952360356", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"6602995350": {"Name": "Barrios G.", "AuthorID": "6602995350", "AffiliationID": "60003209, 60032442", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Energ\u00edas Renovables, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "6603575650": {"Name": "Huelsz G.", "AuthorID": "6603575650", "AffiliationID": "60003209, 60032442", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Energ\u00edas Renovables, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "56228917000": {"Name": "Rojas J.", "AuthorID": "56228917000", "AffiliationID": "60003209, 60032442", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Energ\u00edas Renovables, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "57027071800": {"Name": "Casas J.M.", "AuthorID": "57027071800", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Posgrado en Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}}}
