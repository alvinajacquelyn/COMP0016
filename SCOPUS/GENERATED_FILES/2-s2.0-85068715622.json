Two simple cases of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) degradation and nulling of a sub-set of the available radar pulses are considered for these initial results, leaving more complex forms of jamming or degradation for future work. Experimental data collected with a multistatic radar are used in this study, aiming to classify 7 similar human activities, when individual subjects are walking carrying different objects. The results show that the use of multistatic radar data can provide resilience to the effect of the data degradation, thanks to the redundancy and additional information available from multiple radar nodes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Machine learning", "Radar data degradation and jamming", "Radar micro-Doppler", "Target classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification performance", "Complex forms", "Data degradation", "Human activities", "Micro-Doppler", "Multiple radar", "Radar data", "Target Classification"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068715622", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "57202333097": {"Name": "Patel J.", "AuthorID": "57202333097", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "22957933900": {"Name": "Gurbuz S.Z.", "AuthorID": "22957933900", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
