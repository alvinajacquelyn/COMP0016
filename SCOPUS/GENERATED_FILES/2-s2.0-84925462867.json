The conference aims to gather the diverse components of the contemporary architectural tendencies that push the building envelope towards free form and respond to the multiple current design challenges. It involves architects, engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and contractors. This conference report summarizes the recently concluded AAG 2014 held in London.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Architectural geometry", "Computational design", "Design and practice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925462867", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"7103161991": {"Name": "Mitra N.J.", "AuthorID": "7103161991", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
