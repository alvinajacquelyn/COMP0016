We analysed patient and isolate data for KPC-positive bacteria confirmed by the national reference laboratory from UK laboratories from August 2003 to August 2014, excluding North-West England, where the epidemiology has previously been studied. Methods: MICs were determined by BSAC agar dilution. Carbapenem-resistant isolates lacking imipenem/EDTA synergy were tested by PCR for blaKPC. MLST and blaKPC sequencing were performed on a subset of isolates. Plasmid analysis was performed by transformation, PCR-based replicon typing and, in some cases, whole-plasmid sequencing. Patient data provided by the sending laboratories were reviewed. Results: Two hundred and ten isolates with KPC enzymes were submitted from 71 UK laboratories outside North- West England, representing 160 patients. All were Enterobacteriaceae, predominantly K. pneumoniae (82%; 173/ 210), and most (91%; 191/210)were from hospitalized patients. Analysis of 100 isolates identified blaKPC-2 (62%), blaKPC-3 (30%) and blaKPC-4 (8%). Clonal group (CG) 258 was dominant among K. pneumoniae (64%; 54/84), but 21 unrelated STs were also identified. Plasmid analysis identified a diverse range of plasmids representing \u226511 different replicon types and found in multiple STs and species. Most (34/35) plasmids with IncFIB/FIIK replicons exhibited \u226599% sequence identity to pKpQIL. Conclusions: KPC enzymes are increasingly detected in Enterobacteriaceae in the UK, albeit without the major outbreaks seen in North-West England. K. pneumoniae CG258 are the dominant hosts, but plasmid spread plays a major role in KPC dissemination between other K. pneumoniae STs and enterobacterial species.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Proteins", "beta-Lactamases", "Enterobacteriaceae", "Enterobacteriaceae Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Middle Aged", "Multilocus Sequence Typing", "Plasmids", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965006567", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"42461482400": {"Name": "Findlay J.", "AuthorID": "42461482400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "57206470677": {"Name": "Hopkins K.L.", "AuthorID": "57206470677", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "6602230553": {"Name": "Doumith M.", "AuthorID": "6602230553", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "7006341306": {"Name": "Meunier D.", "AuthorID": "7006341306", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "7404753588": {"Name": "Hill R.", "AuthorID": "7404753588", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "8583885400": {"Name": "Pike R.", "AuthorID": "8583885400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "56003547000": {"Name": "Loy R.", "AuthorID": "56003547000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "56819891000": {"Name": "Mustafa N.", "AuthorID": "56819891000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "7103209438": {"Name": "Livermore D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103209438", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "7005737009": {"Name": "Woodford N.", "AuthorID": "7005737009", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, Public Health England"}, "6602710272": {"Name": "Wiuff C.", "AuthorID": "6602710272", "AffiliationID": "60111371", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Scotland"}}}
