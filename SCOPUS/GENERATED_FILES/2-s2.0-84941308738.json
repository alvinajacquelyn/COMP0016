Stiffness also occurs in fibrotic conditions such as shoulder capsulitis and Dupuytren's contracture. We speculated that the two traits (TJR and fibrotic disease) are linked pathogenically. Methods Using the TwinsUK NIHR BRC BioResource we tested the hypotheses that 1) joint (hip and knee) stiffness, TJR (hip and knee), and fibrotic conditions are associated and 2) genetic factors contribute to them. Results Participating twins (n = 9718) had completed self-reported questionnaires on the traits of interest. All three traits were significantly associated with increasing age and body mass index (BMI), as well as female sex, on univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between TJR and joint stiffness (OR = 3.96, 95% confidence interval, CI 2.77-5.68) and between fibrotic conditions and joint stiffness (OR = 2.39, 1.74-3.29), adjusting for age, sex, BMI and twin relatedness. Monozygotic versus dizygotic intraclass correlations gave heritability estimates for TJR = 46% and joint stiffness = 32%. Conclusion That fibrotic conditions, joint stiffness and TJR are significantly associated suggests a common disease process, possibly fibrosis, which is genetically mediated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Body Mass Index", "Dupuytren Contracture", "Female", "Fibrosis", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Hip Joint", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Osteoarthritis, Hip", "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941308738", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8059345500": {"Name": "Williams F.M.", "AuthorID": "8059345500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London"}, "6507925916": {"Name": "Fabiane S.M.", "AuthorID": "6507925916", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London"}, "23018701000": {"Name": "Kalson N.S.", "AuthorID": "23018701000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Fibrosis Research Group, Institute of Cellular Medicine, University of Newcastle"}, "6701660530": {"Name": "Deehan D.J.", "AuthorID": "6701660530", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Fibrosis Research Group, Institute of Cellular Medicine, University of Newcastle"}, "7402056276": {"Name": "Mann D.A.", "AuthorID": "7402056276", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Fibrosis Research Group, Institute of Cellular Medicine, University of Newcastle"}}}
