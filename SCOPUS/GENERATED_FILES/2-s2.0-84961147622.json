In the semi-batch deoxygenation of tristearin at 260 \u00b0C a pronounced promotional effect was observed, a 20% Ni-5% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst affording both higher conversion (97%) and selectivity to C10-C17 alkanes (99% of liquid product) in comparison with unpromoted 20% Ni/Al2O3 (27% conversion and 87% selectivity to C10-C17). In the same reaction at 350 \u00b0C, a 20% Ni-1% Sn/Al2O3 catalyst afforded the best results, giving yields of C10-C17 and C17 of 97% and 55%, respectively, which contrasts with the corresponding values of 87% and 21% obtained over 20% Ni/Al2O3. Equally encouraging results were obtained in the semi-batch deoxygenation of stearic acid at 300 \u00b0C, in which the 20% Ni-5% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst afforded the highest yields of C10-C17 and C17. Experiments were also conducted at 260 \u00b0C in a fixed bed reactor using triolein - a model unsaturated triglyceride - as the feed. While both 20% Ni/Al2O3 and 20% Ni-5% Cu/Al2O3 achieved quantitative yields of diesel-like hydrocarbons at all reaction times sampled, the Cu-promoted catalyst exhibited higher selectivity to longer chain hydrocarbons, a phenomenon which was also observed in experiments involving algal lipids as the feed. Characterization of fresh and spent catalysts indicates that Cu enhances the reducibility of Ni and suppresses both cracking reactions and coke-induced deactivation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Copper", "Deoxygenation", "Lipids", "Nickel", "Tin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cracking reactions", "Deoxygenations", "Fixed bed reactor", "Liquid products", "Promoted catalysts", "Promotional effect", "Quantitative yields", "Spent catalyst"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961147622", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"56458464400": {"Name": "Loe R.", "AuthorID": "56458464400", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky"}, "16246118400": {"Name": "Santillan-Jimenez E.", "AuthorID": "16246118400", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky"}, "15073314300": {"Name": "Morgan T.", "AuthorID": "15073314300", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky"}, "57183985100": {"Name": "Sewell L.", "AuthorID": "57183985100", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky"}, "12791804200": {"Name": "Ji Y.", "AuthorID": "12791804200", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky"}, "55927868900": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "55927868900", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky"}, "12646350700": {"Name": "Crocker M.", "AuthorID": "12646350700", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}}}
