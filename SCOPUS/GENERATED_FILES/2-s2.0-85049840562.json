Robustly recovering any primordial signal from the dominant foreground emission will require high-fidelity observations at multiple frequencies, with excellent control of systematics. We explore the potential for a new platform for CMB observations, the Airlander 10 hybrid air vehicle, to perform this task.We show that the Airlander 10 platform, operating at commercial airline altitudes, is well suited to mapping frequencies above 220 GHz, which are critical for cleaning CMB maps of dust emission. Optimizing the distribution of detectors across frequencies, we forecast the ability of Airlander 10 to clean foregrounds of varying complexity as a function of altitude, demonstrating its complementarity with both existing (Planck) and ongoing (C-BASS) foreground observations. This novel platform could play a key role in defining our ultimate view of the polarized microwave sky.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmic background radiation", "Early Universe", "Methods: statistical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049840562", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"46461013400": {"Name": "Feeney S.M.", "AuthorID": "46461013400", "AffiliationID": "117860623", "AffiliationName": "Center for Computational Astrophysics"}, "36482758000": {"Name": "Gudmundsson J.E.", "AuthorID": "36482758000", "AffiliationID": "60026364", "AffiliationName": "Nordita (Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics)"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003944328": {"Name": "Verde L.", "AuthorID": "7003944328", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA"}, "24832629800": {"Name": "Errard J.", "AuthorID": "24832629800", "AffiliationID": "60157983, 60008134, 60025995, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "LPNHE, CNRS-IN2P3 and Universit\u00e9s Paris 6 and 7"}}}
