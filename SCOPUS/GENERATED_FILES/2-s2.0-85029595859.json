Nevertheless, public awareness of DLD is poor, and one goal of this special issue is to showcase a set of papers that provide a clear and coherent message about the nature and impact of DLD, and the potential of intervention to mitigate these impacts. In this editorial, we highlight seminal papers JCPP has published on language disorders over the last 40 years. Many of the issues raised then are still relevant now; however, the papers that comprise this special issue exemplify how far the field has come in achieving consensus on terminology and diagnostic criteria, and producing highly consistent findings on the stability and impact of DLD, and the potential for language change in response to targeted interventions. The editorial concludes with a road map for future research and clinical priorities that includes the need for randomised controlled trials that specifically address the impact of co-morbidities on response to treatment, impacts of intervention on broader developmental outcomes, and the experiences of adults with DLD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Language Development Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029595859", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7006372166": {"Name": "Norbury C.", "AuthorID": "7006372166", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005682785": {"Name": "Sonuga-Barke E.", "AuthorID": "7005682785", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
