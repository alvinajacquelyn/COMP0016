Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.Background Cannabidiol (CBD) exhibits anti-inflammatory properties that could improve disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease. This proof-of-concept study assessed efficacy, safety and tolerability of CBD-rich botanical extract in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Methods Patients aged 18 years or older, with left-sided or extensive UC, Mayo scores of 4-10 (endoscopy scores \u22651), and on stable 5-aminosalicylic acid dosing, were randomized to 10-weeks' CBD-rich botanical extract or placebo capsules. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients in remission after treatment. Statistical testing was 2-sided, using a 10% significance level. Results Patients were less tolerant of CBD-rich botanical extract compared with placebo, taking on average one-third fewer capsules, and having more compliance-related protocol deviations (principally insufficient exposure), prompting identification of a per protocol (PP) analysis set. The primary endpoint was negative; end of treatment remission rates were similar for CBD-rich botanical extract (28%) and placebo (26%). However, PP analysis of total and partial Mayo scores favoured CBD-rich botanical extract (P = 0.068 and P = 0.038, respectively). Additionally, PP analyses of the more subjective physician's global assessment of illness severity, subject global impression of change, and patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes were improved for patients taking CBD-rich botanical extract (P = 0.069, P = 0.003, and P = 0.065, respectively). Adverse events (AEs) were predominantly mild/moderate with many in the CBD-rich botanical extract group potentially attributable to the a\u2020 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol content. A greater proportion of gastrointestinal-related AEs, indicative of UC worsening, was seen on placebo. Conclusion Although the primary endpoint was not reached, several signals suggest CBD-rich botanical extract may be beneficial for symptomatic treatment of UC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cannabidiol", "cannabinoid", "inflammatory bowel disease", "Mayo", "ulcerative colitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Adult", "Cannabidiol", "Colitis, Ulcerative", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Plant Extracts", "Remission Induction", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044442793", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"8424102200": {"Name": "Irving P.M.", "AuthorID": "8424102200", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57188770606": {"Name": "Iqbal T.", "AuthorID": "57188770606", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004936961": {"Name": "Nwokolo C.", "AuthorID": "7004936961", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust"}, "14029464700": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "14029464700", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14049662600": {"Name": "Bloom S.", "AuthorID": "14049662600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202700451": {"Name": "Prasad N.", "AuthorID": "7202700451", "AffiliationID": "60027642", "AffiliationName": "Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201706094": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "7201706094", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "North West London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202223898": {"Name": "Murray C.", "AuthorID": "57202223898", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201432421": {"Name": "Lindsay J.O.", "AuthorID": "7201432421", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57191985227": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57191985227", "AffiliationID": "60109237", "AffiliationName": "GW Research Ltd"}, "57200968069": {"Name": "Barron R.", "AuthorID": "57200968069", "AffiliationID": "60109237", "AffiliationName": "GW Research Ltd"}, "57194425843": {"Name": "Wright S.", "AuthorID": "57194425843", "AffiliationID": "60109237", "AffiliationName": "GW Research Ltd"}}}
