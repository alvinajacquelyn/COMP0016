All rights reserved.Background Whole-gland salvage Iodine-125-brachytherapy is a potentially curative treatment strategy for localised prostate cancer (PCa) recurrences after radiotherapy. Prognostic factors influencing PCa-specific and overall survival (PCaSS & OS) are not known. The objective of this study was to develop a multivariable, internally validated prognostic model for survival after whole-gland salvage I-125-brachytherapy. Materials and methods Whole-gland salvage I-125-brachytherapy patients treated in the Netherlands from 1993-2010 were included. Eligible patients had a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy-confirmed localised recurrence after biochemical failure (clinical judgement, ASTRO or Phoenix-definition). Recurrences were assessed clinically and with CT and/or MRI. Metastases were excluded using CT/MRI and technetium-99m scintigraphy. Multivariable Cox-regression was used to assess the predictive value of clinical characteristics in relation to PCa-specific and overall mortality. PCa-specific mortality was defined as patients dying with distant metastases present. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation (20 imputed sets). Internal validation was performed and the C-statistic calculated. Calibration plots were created to visually assess the goodness-of-fit of the final model. Optimism-corrected survival proportions were calculated. All analyses were performed according to the TRIPOD statement. Results Median total follow-up was 78 months (range 5-139). A total of 62 patients were treated, of which 28 (45%) died from PCa after mean (\u00b1SD) 82 (\u00b136) months. Overall, 36 patients (58%) patients died after mean 84 (\u00b140) months. PSA doubling time (PSADT) remained a predictive factor for both types of mortality (PCa-specific and overall): corrected hazard ratio's (HR's) 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.98, p = 0.02) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99, p = 0.01), respectively (C-statistics 0.71 and 0.69, respectively). Calibration was accurate up to 96 month follow-up. Over 80% of patients can survive 8 years if PSADT > 24 months (PCaSS) and >33 months (OS). Only approximately 50% survival is achieved with a PSADT of 12 months. Conclusion A PSADT of respectively >24 months and >33 months can result in >80% probability of PCa- specific and overall survival 8 years after whole-gland salvage I-125-brachytherapy. Survival should be weighed against toxicity from a salvage procedure. Larger series and external validation are necessary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["I-125-brachytherapy", "Predictive factors", "Prostate cancer", "Survival", "Whole-gland salvage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Brachytherapy", "Humans", "Iodine Radioisotopes", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Salvage Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958068610", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55334701600": {"Name": "Peters M.", "AuthorID": "55334701600", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "8974308500": {"Name": "Van Der Voort Van Zyp J.R.N.", "AuthorID": "8974308500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "6603676425": {"Name": "Moerland M.A.", "AuthorID": "6603676425", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "56151042000": {"Name": "Maenhout M.", "AuthorID": "56151042000", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "36877013000": {"Name": "Van Rossum P.S.N.", "AuthorID": "36877013000", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "56365863700": {"Name": "Van Vulpen M.", "AuthorID": "56365863700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "22950336700": {"Name": "Hoekstra C.J.", "AuthorID": "22950336700", "AffiliationID": "60085484", "AffiliationName": "Radiotherapeutic Institute RISO"}, "11539322500": {"Name": "Van De Pol S.", "AuthorID": "11539322500", "AffiliationID": "60085484", "AffiliationName": "Radiotherapeutic Institute RISO"}, "22952596500": {"Name": "Westendorp H.", "AuthorID": "22952596500", "AffiliationID": "60085484", "AffiliationName": "Radiotherapeutic Institute RISO"}, "6504586577": {"Name": "Kattevilder R.", "AuthorID": "6504586577", "AffiliationID": "60085484", "AffiliationName": "Radiotherapeutic Institute RISO"}, "56153278300": {"Name": "Verkooijen H.M.", "AuthorID": "56153278300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Division, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57114379700": {"Name": "Shah T.T.", "AuthorID": "57114379700", "AffiliationID": "60162048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Whittington Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR UCLH/UCL, Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
