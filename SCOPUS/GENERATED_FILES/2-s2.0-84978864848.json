They are activated by the binding of a neurotransmitter, but the details of this process are still not fully understood. As a prototypical pLGIC, here we choose the insect resistance to dieldrin (RDL) receptor involved in resistance to insecticides and investigate the binding of the neurotransmitter GABA to its extracellular domain at the atomistic level. We achieve this by means of \u03bc-sec funnel-metadynamics simulations, which efficiently enhance the sampling of bound and unbound states by using a funnel-shaped restraining potential to limit the exploration in the solvent. We reveal the sequence of events in the binding process from the capture of GABA from the solvent to its pinning between the charged residues Arg111 and Glu204 in the binding pocket. We characterize the associated free energy landscapes in the wild-type RDL receptor and in two mutant forms, where the key residues Arg111 and Glu204 are mutated to Ala. Experimentally these mutations produce nonfunctional channels, which is reflected in the reduced ligand binding affinities due to the loss of essential interactions. We also analyze the dynamical behavior of the crucial loop C, whose opening allows the access of GABA to the binding site and closure locks the ligand into the protein. The RDL receptor shares structural and functional features with other pLGICs; hence, our work outlines a valuable protocol to study the binding of ligands to pLGICs beyond conventional docking and molecular dynamics techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid", "Ligand-Gated Ion Channels", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978864848", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55279801100": {"Name": "Comitani F.", "AuthorID": "55279801100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London"}, "55925226500": {"Name": "Molteni C.", "AuthorID": "55925226500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London"}, "24344278500": {"Name": "Limongelli V.", "AuthorID": "24344278500", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}}}
