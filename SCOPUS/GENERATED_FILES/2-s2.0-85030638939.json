In this study, a new approach for acquiring an in-vivo whole human brain g-ratio map is proposed. To estimate the g-ratio, myelin volume fraction and axonal volume fraction are acquired using multi-echo gradient echo myelin water imaging (GRE-MWI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), respectively. In order to translate myelin water fraction measured in GRE-MWI into myelin volume fraction, a new scaling procedure is proposed and validated. This scaling approach utilizes geometric measures of myelin structure and, therefore, provides robustness over previous methods. The resulting g-ratio map reveals an expected range of g-ratios (0.71\u20130.85 in major fiber bundles) with a small inter-subject coefficient of variance (less than 2%). Additionally, a few fiber bundles (e.g. cortico-spinal tract and optic radiation) show different constituents of myelin volume fraction and axonal volume fraction, indicating potentials to utilize the measures for deciphering fiber tracking.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion", "g-ratio", "Gradient-echo myelin water imaging (GRE-MWI)", "MRI", "Myelin", "White matter microstructure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Water", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Humans", "Myelin Sheath", "Neurites", "Neuroimaging", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030638939", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57195609922": {"Name": "Jung W.", "AuthorID": "57195609922", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Imaging Science and Technology, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University"}, "57195610282": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57195610282", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Imaging Science and Technology, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University"}, "57195608256": {"Name": "Shin H.", "AuthorID": "57195608256", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Imaging Science and Technology, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University"}, "57203144252": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57203144252", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Imaging Science and Technology, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University"}, "37085483300": {"Name": "Nam Y.", "AuthorID": "37085483300", "AffiliationID": "60003087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science & Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "23103812100": {"Name": "Oh S.", "AuthorID": "23103812100", "AffiliationID": "60007830", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies"}}}
