CSCs are a subtype of cancer cells with the ability to differentiate, self-renew, and form secondary or tertiary tumors. Current cancer treatments-including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery-effectively remove bulk cancer cells but are unable to eliminate CSCs. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and anti-CSC properties of a cobalt(III)-cyclam complex bearing two tolfenamic acid moieties, 3. Notably, 3 displays sub-micromolar potency towards breast CSCs and bulk breast cancer cells. Detailed mechanistic studies show that 3 is taken up readily by breast CSCs, enters the nucleus, causes DNA damage, and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, 3 inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in CSCs. The mechanism of action of 3 is similar to that of a naproxen-appended cobalt(III)-cyclam complex, 1 recently reported by our group. The advantage of 3 over 1 is that it has the potential to remove whole tumor populations (bulk cancer cells and CSCs) with a single dose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer stem cell", "Cobalt(III)-cyclam complexes", "COX-2 inhibition", "DNA damage", "Metallopharmaceuticals", "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027776201", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57090463800": {"Name": "Cressey P.", "AuthorID": "57090463800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "57191891112": {"Name": "Eskandari A.", "AuthorID": "57191891112", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "25927531500": {"Name": "Suntharalingam K.", "AuthorID": "25927531500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}}}
