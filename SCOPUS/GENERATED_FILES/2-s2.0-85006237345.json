These illnesses have also been associated with white matter abnormalities, reflected by reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA), measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We assessed the impact of the CACNA1C psychosis risk variant on FA in SZ, BD and health. 230 individuals (with existing ZNF804A rs1344706 genotype data) were genotyped for CACNA1C rs1006737 and underwent DTI. FA data was analysed with tract-based spatial statistics and threshold-free cluster enhancement significance correction (P < 0.05) to detect effects of CACNA1C genotype on FA, and its potential interaction with ZNF804A genotype and with diagnosis, on FA. There was no significant main effect of the CACNA1C genotype on FA, nor diagnosis by genotype(s) interactions. Nevertheless, when inspecting SZ in particular, risk allele carriers had significantly lower FA than the protective genotype individuals, in portions of the left middle occipital and parahippocampal gyri, right cerebellum, left optic radiation and left inferior and superior temporal gyri. Our data suggests a minor involvement of CACNA1C rs1006737 in psychosis via conferring susceptibility to white matter microstructural abnormalities in SZ. Put in perspective, ZNF804A rs1344706, not only had a significant main effect, but its SZ-specific effects were two orders of magnitude more widespread than that of CACNA1C rs1006737.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bipolar disorder", "CACNA1C", "Diffusion tensor imaging", "Fractional anisotropy", "Genome-wide association", "Rs1006737", "Schizophrenia", "White matter", "ZNF804A epistasis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alleles", "Bipolar Disorder", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Epistasis, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006237345", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57188868759": {"Name": "Mallas E.", "AuthorID": "57188868759", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Laboratory, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "26029744300": {"Name": "Carletti F.", "AuthorID": "26029744300", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "26655265600": {"Name": "Chaddock C.A.", "AuthorID": "26655265600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35433190700": {"Name": "Shergill S.", "AuthorID": "35433190700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "6507443795": {"Name": "Picchioni M.M.", "AuthorID": "6507443795", "AffiliationID": "114502081", "AffiliationName": "St. Andrew\u2019s Academic Department, St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare"}, "8855468700": {"Name": "Toulopoulou T.", "AuthorID": "8855468700", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong"}, "8089378900": {"Name": "Bramon E.", "AuthorID": "8089378900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neurosciences Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7102945377": {"Name": "Woolley J.", "AuthorID": "7102945377", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust"}, "8749594800": {"Name": "McDonald C.", "AuthorID": "8749594800", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging, Cognition & Genomics Centre (NICOG), NCBES Galway Neuroscience Centre, College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "56007899300": {"Name": "Kravariti E.", "AuthorID": "56007899300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience King\u2019s College London"}, "24366595400": {"Name": "Kalidindi S.", "AuthorID": "24366595400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience King\u2019s College London"}, "34869208000": {"Name": "Barker G.J.", "AuthorID": "34869208000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "14632352500": {"Name": "Prata D.P.", "AuthorID": "14632352500", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}}}
