We present VTrails, an end-to-end approach to extract geodesic vascular minimum spanning trees from angiographic data by solving a connectivity-optimized anisotropic level-set over a voxel-wise tensor field representing the orientation of the underlying vasculature. Evaluating real and synthetic vascular images, we compare VTrails against the state-of-the-art ridge detectors for tubular structures by assessing the connectedness of the vesselness map and inspecting the synthesized tensor field. The inferred geodesic trees are then quantitatively evaluated within a topologically aware framework, by comparing the proposed method against popular vascular segmentation tool kits on clinical angiographies. VTrails potentials are discussed towards integrating groupwise vascular image analyses. The performance of VTrails demonstrates its versatility and usefulness also for patient-specific applications in interventional neuroradiology and vascular surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood vessels", "brain", "connectivity", "vascular tree"], "IndexKeywords": ["connectivity", "Kernel", "Minimum spanning trees", "Network topology", "Quantitative features", "Tubular structures", "Vascular segmentations", "Vascular trees", "Algorithms", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050762806", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57204021789": {"Name": "Moriconi S.", "AuthorID": "57204021789", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CMIC, Translational Imaging Group, University College London"}, "16551520500": {"Name": "Zuluaga M.", "AuthorID": "16551520500", "AffiliationID": "101759187", "AffiliationName": "Amadeus S.A.S."}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "26642970600": {"Name": "Jager H.", "AuthorID": "26642970600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602253325": {"Name": "Nachev P.", "AuthorID": "6602253325", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}}}
