Bioelectrical impedance (BIA) is a simple and accurate method for estimating body composition, but requires population-specific calibration equations. Objectives: (1) To generate population specific calibration equations to predict lean mass (LM) from BIA in Nepalese children aged 7-9 years. (2) To explore methodological changes that may extend the range and improve accuracy. Methods: BIA measurements were obtained from 102 Nepalese children (52 girls) using the Tanita BC-418. Isotope dilution with deuterium oxide was used to measure total body water and to estimate LM. Prediction equations for estimating LM from BIA data were developed using linear regression, and estimates were compared with those obtained from the Tanita system. We assessed the effects of flexing the arms of children to extend the range of coverage towards lower weights. We also estimated potential error if the number of children included in the study was reduced. Findings: Prediction equations were generated, incorporating height, impedance index, weight and sex as predictors (R2 93%). The Tanita system tended to underestimate LM, with a mean error of 2.2%, but extending up to 25.8%. Flexing the arms to 90\u00b0 increased the lower weight range, but produced a small error that was not significant when applied to children <16 kg (p 0.42). Reducing the number of children increased the error at the tails of the weight distribution. Conclusions: Population-specific isotope calibration of BIA for Nepalese children has high accuracy. Armposition is important and can be used to extend the range of low weight covered. Smaller samples reduce resource requirements, but leads to large errors at the tails of the weight distribution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropometry", "Bioelectrical impedance", "Body composition", "Child", "Nepal"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926513179", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"16300803400": {"Name": "Devakumar D.", "AuthorID": "16300803400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35275054700": {"Name": "Grijalva-Eternod C.S.", "AuthorID": "35275054700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57214450966": {"Name": "Roberts S.", "AuthorID": "57214450966", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "23486721300": {"Name": "Saville N.M.", "AuthorID": "23486721300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "56444089900": {"Name": "Chaube S.S.", "AuthorID": "56444089900", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}, "12767143700": {"Name": "Manandhar D.S.", "AuthorID": "12767143700", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
