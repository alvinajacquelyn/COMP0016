Objective To assess community pharmacists\u2019 current practice, knowledge and confidence in supporting patients\u2019 adherence as part of the NMS for patients on Oral Anti-Coagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention in Atrial Fibrillation. Setting Community pharmacists in London. Method An online cross-sectional survey was sent to pharmacists from their Local Pharmaceutical Committees and advertised by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Analysis was undertaken in SPSs v23 considering a confidence level of 95%. Main outcome measures pharmacists reported confidence of providing the NMS on OACs; training needs and skills for supporting adherence. Results A total of 257 valid responses were analysed (6.8% response rate; {Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.676\u20130.892}). Data indicates that over a 2-month period, 25% of pharmacists had completed \u22656 NMS consultations for all OACs, of which 11% for new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The key priorities in counselling items during the NMS consultation were to discuss actions to take when bleeding occurs, followed by supporting adherence. Pharmacists were more confident in their knowledge, skills and access to resources for Vitamin-K Antagonists (VKAs) than for NOACs (p < 0.005). Results also highlight pharmacists\u2019 unfamiliarity with alert cards, lower for NOACs than VKAs (p < 0.001), albeit perceived as critically important. Half the sample mentioned to use the British National Formulary as information resource. Conclusion Results suggest the provision of NMS for NOACs is low. Supporting pharmacists with tailored education and adherence support might foster dissemination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticoagulants", "Community Pharmacy Services", "Medication adherence", "New Medicine Service", "Pharmaceutical care", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Anticoagulants", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Community Pharmacy Services", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Pharmacists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028984313", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56811332600": {"Name": "Hamedi N.", "AuthorID": "56811332600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Partners"}, "16506217100": {"Name": "Antoniou S.", "AuthorID": "16506217100", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56392680600": {"Name": "Begley A.", "AuthorID": "56392680600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Partners"}, "57162077000": {"Name": "da Costa F.A.", "AuthorID": "57162077000", "AffiliationID": "117799176", "AffiliationName": "Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society (PPS)"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60023957", "AffiliationName": "BMA House"}, "57195584305": {"Name": "Levitan M.", "AuthorID": "57195584305", "AffiliationID": "119194103", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Middlesex Group of Local Pharmaceutical Committees"}}}
