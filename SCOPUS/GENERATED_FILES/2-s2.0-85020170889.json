The Multilayer model is composed of three categories of layers: physical, economic and sociological, which will determine the main outputs of the analyses. These layers are interactive, so to comprehensively study their interrelationships and impacts on international and national trade, we have to construct the model based on two distinct approaches. First, horizontal layers are studied through the use of complex network theory (see inter alia, the works of Barabasi and Albert 1999; Watts and Strogatz 1998; Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi 1959). Thereafter, vertical integration is analysed through the spatial interaction approach of Wilson (1967, 1970). In this way we are able to investigate both horizontal and vertical interdependency among layers and determine the impacts of natural and man-made shocks, such as (for the SPICs case study) the introduction of a specific policy for the reduction of transport cost, the maintenance of infrastructure and the provision of inter-island shipping services.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020170889", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6603380130": {"Name": "Medda F.", "AuthorID": "6603380130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "36157854300": {"Name": "Caravelli F.", "AuthorID": "36157854300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "36462364400": {"Name": "Caschili S.", "AuthorID": "36462364400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "7404870460": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "7404870460", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
