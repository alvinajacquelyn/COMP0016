Vox Sanguinis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society of Blood TransfusionBackground and Objectives: Paediatric blood transfusion for severe anaemia in hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa remains common. Yet, reports describing the haematological quality of donor blood or storage duration in routine practice are very limited. Both factors are likely to affect transfusion outcomes. Materials and Methods: We undertook three audits examining the distribution of pack types, haematological quality and storage duration of donor blood used in a paediatric clinical trial of blood at four hospitals in Africa (Uganda and Malawi). Results: The overall distribution of whole blood, packed cells (plasma-reduced by centrifugation) and red cell concentrates (RCC) (plasma-reduced by gravity-dependent sedimentation) used in a randomised trial was 40\u00b77% (N = 1215), 22\u00b74% (N = 669) and 36\u00b78% (N = 1099), respectively. The first audit found similar median haematocrits of 57\u00b70% (50\u00b70,74\u00b70), 64\u00b70% (52\u00b70,72\u00b75; P = 0\u00b7238 vs. whole blood) and 56\u00b70% (48\u00b70,67\u00b70; P = 0\u00b7462) in whole blood, RCC and packed cells, respectively, which resulted from unclear pack labelling by blood transfusion services (BTS). Re-training of the BTS, hospital blood banks and clinical teams led to, in subsequent audits, significant differences in median haematocrit and haemoglobins across the three pack types and values within expected ranges. Median storage duration time was 12 days (IQR: 6, 19) with 18\u00b72% (537/2964) over 21 days in storage. Initially, 9 (2\u00b78%) packs were issued past the recommended duration of storage, dropping to 0\u00b73% (N = 7) in the third audit post-training. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of close interactions and education between BTS and clinical services and the importance of haemovigilance to ensure safe transfusion practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anaemia", "blood transfusion services", "donor blood pack", "haematocrit", "haemoglobin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anemia", "Blood Banks", "Blood Donors", "Blood Transfusion", "Child", "Hematocrit", "Hematology", "Hemoglobins", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Malawi", "Pediatrics", "Quality Assurance, Health Care", "Quality Control", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Refrigeration", "Reproducibility of Results", "Specimen Handling", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062573669", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"9042273400": {"Name": "Uyoga S.", "AuthorID": "9042273400", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "55621345200": {"Name": "Mpoya A.", "AuthorID": "55621345200", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "35430527200": {"Name": "Williams T.N.", "AuthorID": "35430527200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, St Mary's Campus Imperial College"}, "57189230439": {"Name": "Maitland K.", "AuthorID": "57189230439", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, St Mary's Campus Imperial College"}, "23987091400": {"Name": "Olupot-Olupot P.", "AuthorID": "23987091400", "AffiliationID": "60120545", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Busitema University, Mbale Campus"}, "15051841700": {"Name": "Kiguli S.", "AuthorID": "15051841700", "AffiliationID": "60071676, 60071696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Mulago Hospital, Makerere University"}, "16040229000": {"Name": "Opoka R.O.", "AuthorID": "16040229000", "AffiliationID": "60071676, 60071696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Mulago Hospital, Makerere University"}, "41961132000": {"Name": "Engoru C.", "AuthorID": "41961132000", "AffiliationID": "106420219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Soroti Regional Referral Hospital"}, "6508111680": {"Name": "Mallewa M.", "AuthorID": "6508111680", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "7101730459": {"Name": "Kennedy N.", "AuthorID": "7101730459", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Science, Queen's University"}, "36552670600": {"Name": "M'baya B.", "AuthorID": "36552670600", "AffiliationID": "108458178", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Blood Transfusion Service"}, "6507768270": {"Name": "Kyeyune D.", "AuthorID": "6507768270", "AffiliationID": "101525189", "AffiliationName": "Uganda Blood Transfusion Service"}, "25636073300": {"Name": "Wabwire B.", "AuthorID": "25636073300", "AffiliationID": "116206633", "AffiliationName": "Mbale Regional Blood Bank"}, "57204280700": {"Name": "Bates I.", "AuthorID": "57204280700", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Pembroke Place"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology, University College London"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology, University College London"}, "55989124100": {"Name": "George E.C.", "AuthorID": "55989124100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology, University College London"}}}
