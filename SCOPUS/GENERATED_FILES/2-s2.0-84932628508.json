Typically, the term has mainly been related to epileptic episodes, but the spectrum of clinical conditions associated with this feature is wide-ranging even if never discussed in detail. By searching the electronic database, we may find that apart from the epileptic conditions, Intermittent Head Drops have been in fact reported in the setting of movement disorders, sleep disorders and even internal medicine disorders, such as Sandifer syndrome. We render an in-depth description of this characteristic phenomenon in different diseases, describing the clinical clues and neurophysiological patterns that may help the clinician to distinguish between the different settings of occurrence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Epilepsy", "Gastroesophageal Reflux", "Head", "Humans", "Movement Disorders", "Torticollis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932628508", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"25638550600": {"Name": "Antelmi E.", "AuthorID": "25638550600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}, "7005146467": {"Name": "Plazzi G.", "AuthorID": "7005146467", "AffiliationID": "60104781", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "7005673009": {"Name": "Tinuper P.", "AuthorID": "7005673009", "AffiliationID": "60104781", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "25222055800": {"Name": "Liguori R.", "AuthorID": "25222055800", "AffiliationID": "60104781", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}, "25642482400": {"Name": "Balint B.", "AuthorID": "25642482400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}}}
