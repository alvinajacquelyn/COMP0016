The present note analyzes MPT models subject to order constraints on subsets of its parameters. The constraints that we consider frequently arise in cases where the response categories are ordered in some sense such as in confidence-rating data, Likert scale data, where graded guessing tendencies or response biases are created via base-rate or payoff manipulations, in the analysis of contingency tables with order constraints, and in many other cases. We show how to construct an MPT model without order constraints that is statistically equivalent to the MPT model with order constraints. This new closure result extends the mathematical analysis of the MPT class, and it offers an approach to order-restricted inference that extends the approaches discussed by Knapp and Batchelder (2004). The usefulness of the method is illustrated by means of an analysis of an order-constrained version of the two-high-threshold model for confidence ratings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Categorical data", "Mathematical models", "Multinomial distribution", "Multinomial processing tree models"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916941661", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7006445400": {"Name": "Klauer K.", "AuthorID": "7006445400", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "36519071500": {"Name": "Kellen D.", "AuthorID": "36519071500", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}}}
