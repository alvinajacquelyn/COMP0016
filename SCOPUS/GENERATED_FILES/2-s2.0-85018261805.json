Patients and methods: 2530 aCRC patients were assessed from three randomised trials. End-points were progression-free survival, response rate, disease control rate, post-progression survival (P-PS) and overall survival. Treatments included first-line oxaliplatin/ fluorouracil (OxFU) and second-line irinotecan. Clinicians were unaware of BRAF-status. Results: 231 patients (9.1%) had BRAF-mutant tumours. BRAF-mutation conferred significantly worse survival independent of associated clinicopathological factors known to be prognostic. Compared with wild-type, BRAF-mutant patients treated with firstline OxFU had similar DCR (59.2% versus 72%; adjusted OR=0.76, P=0.24) and PFS (5.7 versus 6.3 months; adjusted HR=1.14, P=0.26). Following progression on first-line chemotherapy, BRAF-mutant patients had a markedly shorter P-PS (4.2 versus 9.2 months, adjusted HR=1.69, P < 0.001). Fewer BRAF-mutant patients received second-line treatment (33% versus 51%, P < 0.001), but BRAF-mutation was not associated with inferior second-line outcomes (RR adjusted OR=0.56, P=0.45; PFS adjusted HR=1.01, P=0.93). Significant clinical heterogeneity within the BRAF-mutant population was observed: a proportion (24.3%) had good firstline PFS and P-PS (both > 6months;OS=24.0 months); however, 36.5% progressed rapidly through first-line chemotherapy and thereafter, with OS=4.7 months. Conclusions: BRAF-mutant aCRC confers a markedly worse prognosis independent of associated clinicopathological features. Chemotherapy provides meaningful improvements in outcome throughout treatment lines. Post-progression survival is markedly worse and vigilance is required to ensure appropriate delivery of treatment after first-line progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRAF-mutant", "Chemotherapy", "Colorectal cancer", "Prognosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Camptothecin", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Fluorouracil", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Staging", "Organoplatinum Compounds", "Prognosis", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018261805", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"53464350100": {"Name": "Seligmann J.F.", "AuthorID": "53464350100", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60020454, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, St. James's University Hospital"}, "36973502600": {"Name": "Richman S.D.", "AuthorID": "36973502600", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60020454, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, St. James's University Hospital"}, "16309635500": {"Name": "Elliott F.", "AuthorID": "16309635500", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60020454, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, St. James's University Hospital"}, "57203231963": {"Name": "Quirke P.", "AuthorID": "57203231963", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60020454, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, St. James's University Hospital"}, "7004392437": {"Name": "Seymour M.", "AuthorID": "7004392437", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60020454, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, St. James's University Hospital"}, "55604307900": {"Name": "Fisher D.", "AuthorID": "55604307900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "56429803800": {"Name": "Smith C.G.", "AuthorID": "56429803800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University"}, "57220824790": {"Name": "Adams R.", "AuthorID": "57220824790", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University"}, "57194781109": {"Name": "Cheadle J.", "AuthorID": "57194781109", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University"}, "57217781287": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "57217781287", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "7004025232": {"Name": "Maughan T.", "AuthorID": "7004025232", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "7005254685": {"Name": "Middleton G.", "AuthorID": "7005254685", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham and University Hospital"}}}
