In dense urban areas, these phenomena will be exacerbated by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and indoor overheating. This paper assesses population exposure and vulnerability to high summer temperatures by exploring the geospatial connection between the UHI, housing energy efficiency and overheating risk, and social vulnerability indicators, such as income and the elderly population. Focusing on Madrid and London, two European cities with strong UHIs but contrasting drivers of indoor heat risk, the spatial distribution of selected indicators were analysed by means of Geographical Information Systems, and areas with the highest vulnerability towards summer energy poverty were identified. It was found that while \u2018hot and vulnerable\u2019 areas are present in both Madrid and London, there are significant differences in climate, socioeconomic distribution and housing between the two cities. In warmer climates such as Madrid, energy poverty\u2014traditionally defined by wintertime heating\u2014requires its definition to be broadened to include summertime cooling needs; in the context of climate change and urban warming trends, this may soon also be the case in northern cities such as London.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cooling energy demand", "Elderly", "Energy poverty", "Fuel poverty", "Heat vulnerability", "London", "Low income", "Madrid", "Urban heat island"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cooling energy", "Elderly", "Energy poverties", "Fuel poverty", "London", "Low incomes", "Madrid", "Urban heat island"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062277482", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57204728191": {"Name": "Sanchez-Guevara C.", "AuthorID": "57204728191", "AffiliationID": "60028442, 60108420", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture (ETSAM) Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"}, "57197737832": {"Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez Peir\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "57197737832", "AffiliationID": "60028442, 60108420", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture (ETSAM) Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"}, "7405402740": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7405402740", "AffiliationID": "60028442, 60108420", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture (ETSAM) Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"}, "35077188000": {"Name": "Mavrogianni A.", "AuthorID": "35077188000", "AffiliationID": "60028442, 60108420", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture (ETSAM) Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"}, "6506878481": {"Name": "Neila Gonz\u00e1lez J.", "AuthorID": "6506878481", "AffiliationID": "60028442, 60108420", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture (ETSAM) Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"}}}
