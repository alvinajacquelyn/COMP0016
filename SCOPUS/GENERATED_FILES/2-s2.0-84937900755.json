In these crystals, two H(Cat-EDT-TTF/ST) units share a hydrogen atom with a short O-H-O hydrogen bond. The calculated band structure near the Fermi level shows a quasi-two-dimensional character with a rather large interlayer dispersion due to the absence of insulating layers, in contrast with conventional molecular conductors. We discuss effective low-energy models based on H(Cat-EDT-TTF/ST) units and its dimers, respectively, where the microscopic character of the orbitals composing them are analyzed. Furthermore, we find a stable structure which is different from the experimentally determined structure, where the shared hydrogen atom becomes localized to one of the oxygen atoms, in which charge disproportionation between the two types of H(Cat-EDT-TTF) units is associated. The calculated potential energy surface for the H atom is very shallow near the minimum points; therefore the probability of the H atom can be delocalized between the two O atoms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937900755", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"22635948400": {"Name": "Tsumuraya T.", "AuthorID": "22635948400", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Young Scientists, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "57080308000": {"Name": "Kato R.", "AuthorID": "57080308000", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "Condensed Molecular Materials Laboratory, RIKEN"}, "56052137500": {"Name": "Miyazaki T.", "AuthorID": "56052137500", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Computational Materials Science Unit, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "7202015507": {"Name": "Seo H.", "AuthorID": "7202015507", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Matter Theory Research Team, CEMS, RIKEN"}}}
