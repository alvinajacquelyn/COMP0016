In this context, the choice of cells to be seeded and the microenvironment conditioning are pivotal. Biochemical and biomechanical stimuli seem to activate physiological regulatory pathways that induce the production of molecules and proteins stimulating stem cell differentiation toward vascular lineage and reproducing natural cross-talks among vascular cells to improve the maturation of tissue engineered blood vessels. Thus, this review focuses on (1) available cell sources, and (2) biochemical and biomechanical stimuli, with the final aim to obtain the long-term stability of the endothelium and mechanical properties suitable for withstanding physiological load.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADSC", "biochemical stimuli", "biomechanical stimuli", "bioreactor", "EC", "EPC", "ESC", "MSC", "vascular tissue engineering", "VSMC"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Blood Vessels", "Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930329634", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"]], "AuthorData": {"56667441200": {"Name": "Tresoldi C.", "AuthorID": "56667441200", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}, "56615988200": {"Name": "Pellegata A.", "AuthorID": "56615988200", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}, "56211980000": {"Name": "Mantero S.", "AuthorID": "56211980000", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}}}
