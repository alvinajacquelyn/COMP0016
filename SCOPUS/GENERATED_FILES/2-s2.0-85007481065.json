The qu values of the specimens moulded for each curing period were normalized (i.e. divided) by the qu attained by a specimen with a specific porosity/cement index. A unique relationship was found, establishing the relationship between strength for artificially cemented silty/clayey soils considering all porosities, Portland cement amounts, moisture contents and curing periods studied. From a practical viewpoint, this means that, at limit, carrying out only one unconfined compression test with a silty/clayey soil specimen, moulded with a specific Portland cement amount, a specific porosity and moisture content and cured for a given time period, allows the determination of a general relationship equation that controls the strength for an entire range of porosities and cement contents, reducing considerably the amount of moulded specimens and reducing projects development cost and time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fine grained soils", "Normalization", "Porosity", "Porosity/cement index", "Portland cement", "Strength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Development costs", "Fine grained soil", "Normalization", "Relationship equations", "Specific porosity", "Strength", "Unconfined compression tests", "Unconfined compressive strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007481065", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"6603094657": {"Name": "Consoli N.", "AuthorID": "6603094657", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"}, "57192695810": {"Name": "Veloso Marques S.", "AuthorID": "57192695810", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"}, "15831644800": {"Name": "Festugato L.", "AuthorID": "15831644800", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"}, "45560920700": {"Name": "Corte M.", "AuthorID": "45560920700", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"}, "57192690816": {"Name": "Vaz Ferreira P.", "AuthorID": "57192690816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "11640513400": {"Name": "Tang C.", "AuthorID": "11640513400", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, University of Nanjing"}}}
