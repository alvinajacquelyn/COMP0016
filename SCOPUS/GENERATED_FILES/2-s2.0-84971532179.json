We present a comparative study of positronium, positron and electron elastic scattering from atomic hydrogen in order to investigate if a similar behaviour occurs for this target at low velocities where inelastic channels are closed. We calculate elastic cross sections for the three projectiles using Kohn-type variational methods which allows us to make a detailed study of the differences and similarities. We find a qualitative similarity in the spin-weighted elastic integrated cross sections for positronium and electron scattering and a good agreement between the singlet integrated cross sections. However, this agreement does extend to the low velocity region and where the agreement is found in the integrated cross sections we show that it is not present in the individual partial waves cross sections. Interestingly, given the agreement we find in the singlet integrated cross section for electron and positronium scattering, when comparing the overall shapes of the corresponding singlet differential cross sections we find different angular and velocity dependencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anti-matter", "atomic scattering", "hydrogen", "positronium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-matter", "Atomic scattering", "Differential cross section", "Elastic cross sections", "Electron elastic scattering", "Integrated cross sections", "positronium", "Scattering cross section"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971532179", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189504271": {"Name": "Reeth P.", "AuthorID": "57189504271", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6604029802": {"Name": "Humberston J.", "AuthorID": "6604029802", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56816338900": {"Name": "Woods D.", "AuthorID": "56816338900", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of North Texas"}, "7402385657": {"Name": "Ward S.", "AuthorID": "7402385657", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of North Texas"}}}
