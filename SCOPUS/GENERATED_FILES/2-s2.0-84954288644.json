Objectives - This work looks at the application of one-dimensional diffusion-edited 1H-NMR spectroscopy (1D DOSY) and 1H-NMR with suppression of the ethanol and water signals to the characterisation of quality and stability markers in multi-component herbal medicines/food supplements. Material and Methods - The experiments were performed with commercial tinctures of Valeriana officinalis L. (valerian), expired and non-expired, as well as its combination with Hummulus lupulus L. (hops), which is one of the most popular blends of relaxant herbs. These techniques did not require purification or evaporation of components for the qualitative analysis of the mixture, but only the addition of D2O and TSP. Results - The best diagnostic signals were found at \u03b4 7 ppm (H-11, valerenic acid), \u03b4 4.2 ppm (H-1, hydroxyvalerenic acid) and \u03b4 1.5-1.8 ppm (methyl groups in prenylated moieties, \u03b1-acids/prenylated flavones). Conclusion - This work concludes on the potential value of 1D DOSY 1H-NMR to provide additional assurance of quality in complex natural mixtures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diffusion edited spectroscopy", "Herbal medicinal product", "Humulus lupulus L", "nuclear magnetic resonance", "quality marker", "Valeriana officinalis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Herbal Medicine", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Solvents", "Valerian"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954288644", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"]], "AuthorData": {"7201826721": {"Name": "Prieto J.M.", "AuthorID": "7201826721", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "55579395700": {"Name": "Mellinas-Gomez M.", "AuthorID": "55579395700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
