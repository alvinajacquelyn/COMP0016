We develop and evaluate a system to detect fatigue from speech recordings collected from speakers kept awake over a 60-hour period. A binary classification system (fatigued/not-fatigued) based on time spent awake showed good discrimination, with 80 % unweighted accuracy using raw features, and 90 % with speaker-normalized features. We describe the data collection, feature analysis, machine learning and cross-validation used in the study. Results are promising for real-world applications in domains such as aerospace, transportation and mining where operators are in regular verbal communication as part of their normal working activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational paralinguistics", "Fatigue", "Speech"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic systems", "Binary classification", "Critical environment", "Cross validation", "Feature analysis", "Paralinguistics", "Speech recording", "Verbal communications"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952332761", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55764009400": {"Name": "Baykaner K.", "AuthorID": "55764009400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, UCL"}, "6603430483": {"Name": "Huckvale M.", "AuthorID": "6603430483", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, UCL"}, "35423146300": {"Name": "Whiteley I.", "AuthorID": "35423146300", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Space Medicine, UCL"}, "57028514000": {"Name": "Ryumin O.", "AuthorID": "57028514000", "AffiliationID": "100862176", "AffiliationName": "Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre"}, "57027607900": {"Name": "Andreeva S.", "AuthorID": "57027607900", "AffiliationID": "100862176", "AffiliationName": "Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre"}}}
