Methods: We analysed 827 voluntarily reported incidents relating to oncology patients that occurred over an 18-month period immediately following implementation of an EMM in a paediatric hospital in Australia. We identified medication-related and EMM-related incidents and carried out a content analysis to identify patterns. Results: We found ~79% (n = 651) of incidents were medication-related and, of these, ~45% (n = 294) were EMM-related. Medication-related incidents included issues with: prescribing; dispensing; administration; patient transfers; missing chemotherapy protocols and information on current stage of patient treatment; coordination of chemotherapy administration; handling or storing medications; children or families handling medications. EMM-related incidents were classified into four groups: technical issues, issues with the user experience, unanticipated problems in EMM workflow, and missing safety features. Conclusions: Incidents reflected difficulties with managing therapies rich in interdependencies. EMM, and especially its \u2018automaticity\u2019, contributed to these incidents. As EMM impacts on safety in such high-risk settings, it is essential that users are aware of and attend to EMM automatic behaviours and are equipped to troubleshoot them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computerized provider order entry system", "evaluation research", "hospital oncology services", "medication errors", "paediatrics", "patient safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Australia", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Electronic Prescribing", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Medication Errors", "Medication Systems, Hospital", "Neoplasms", "Patient Safety", "Pediatrics", "Risk Management", "Tertiary Care Centers", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070904153", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"24177232300": {"Name": "Lichtner V.", "AuthorID": "24177232300", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Systems and Safety Research, AIHI, Macquarie University"}, "6505614589": {"Name": "Baysari M.", "AuthorID": "6505614589", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney"}, "9278702400": {"Name": "Gates P.", "AuthorID": "9278702400", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Systems and Safety Research, AIHI, Macquarie University"}, "7005961363": {"Name": "Westbrook J.I.", "AuthorID": "7005961363", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Systems and Safety Research, AIHI, Macquarie University"}, "6603548056": {"Name": "Dalla-Pozza L.", "AuthorID": "6603548056", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Centre for Children, The Children Hospital at Westmead"}}}
