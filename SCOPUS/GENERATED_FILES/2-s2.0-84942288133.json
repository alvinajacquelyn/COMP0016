All rights reserved.How might the organic link between theatre-making and political action be revitalised? And how might a spontaneous vision of a theatre of and for ordinary people be reignited? Since his political exile from Argentina in 1977, theatre director and producer Horacio Czertok has devoted his life to re-imagining the art of the theatre, taking it out of its comfort zone into places of social conflict such as deprived suburban areas, prisons and mental hospitals, as well as open, public spaces, engaging directly with audiences in a spirit of abiding, carnivalesque, and deeply political theatrical experimentation. Adapting a rigorous Stanislavskian theatrical training to the exigencies of raw, immediate encounters with audiences in marginal and open spaces, Czertok's theatre-making is unique, not only in the kinds of capacities and skills it allows actors to develop, but also in the way it renders the question of political efficacy immanent to the very process of making theatre. Providing Czertok's own, highly personal account of his trajectory in the global scene of theatre-making over the past half-century, this is a book about the theatre of exile - a theatre of streets, prisons, hospitals, open to direct and unexpected encounters with audiences and their life-experiences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942288133", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"56868563900": {"Name": "Czertok H.", "AuthorID": "56868563900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "18437264600": {"Name": "Holbraad M.", "AuthorID": "18437264600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
