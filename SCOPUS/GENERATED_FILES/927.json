Karger AG, Basel.Background: We report the case of a female infant with hypoparathyroidism due to an activating mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene. Case Report: The child presented in the neonatal period with clinical seizures associated with severe hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, low parathyroid hormone levels and elevated urine calcium:creatinine ratios. She required intravenous calcium and phenobarbitone initially, and then oral 1-alfacalcidol (1-AC) and phenobarbitone were started. The patient had intractable hypocalcaemia in the first 5 months of life despite escalating doses of 1-AC. When the phenobarbitone was stopped at 5 months of age she was admitted soon after with symptomatic hypercalcaemia. We postulate that the phenobarbitone increased the metabolism of 1-AC and thus she needed large doses of 1-AC to treat hypocalcaemia until the phenobarbitone was stopped. Her parents had no biochemical abnormalities on testing. Results: Molecular genetic analysis confirmed that our patient had a de novo missense variant, c.682G>A (p.Glu228Lys) in exon 4 of the calcium-sensing receptor. Conclusion: This case report highlights the importance that clinicians caring for children on vitamin D and its analogues are aware of the interaction with phenobarbitone, which can result in symptomatic hypocalcaemia. 1-AC should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C, otherwise it will be rendered inactive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1-Alfacalcidol", "Anticonvulsants", "Calcium-sensing receptor", "Hypocalcaemia", "Hypoparathyroidism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticonvulsants", "Drug Interactions", "Female", "Humans", "Hydroxycholecalciferols", "Hypercalcemia", "Hypocalcemia", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Infant", "Phenobarbital", "Seizures", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924152847", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"54585202400": {"Name": "Formosa N.", "AuthorID": "54585202400", "AffiliationID": "60121834", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Mater Dei Hospital"}, "8532227100": {"Name": "Torpiano J.", "AuthorID": "8532227100", "AffiliationID": "60121834", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Mater Dei Hospital"}, "6603806999": {"Name": "Allgrove J.", "AuthorID": "6603806999", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Royal London Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
