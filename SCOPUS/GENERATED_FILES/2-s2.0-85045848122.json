Preventive therapy could create socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence if it is more readily accepted by particular socio-demographic groups. In this multicentre study, we investigated uptake of tamoxifen and evaluated socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with initiation. We explored women\u2019s experiences of treatment decision-making using qualitative interview data. Methods: Between September 2015 and December 2016, women (n = 732) attending an appointment at one of 20 centres in England to discuss breast cancer risk were approached to complete a survey containing socio-demographic details and nulliparity. Of the baseline survey respondents (n = 408/732, 55.7% response rate), self-reported uptake of tamoxifen at 3-month follow-up was reported in 258 (63.2%). Sixteen women participated in semi-structured interviews. Results: One in seven (38/258 = 14.7%) women initiated tamoxifen. Women who had children were more likely to report use of tamoxifen than those without children (OR = 5.26; 95%CI: 1.13\u201324.49, p = 0.035). Interview data suggested that women weigh up risks and benefits of tamoxifen within the context of familial commitments, with exposure to significant other\u2019s beliefs and experiences of cancer and medication a basis for their decision. Conclusions: Uptake of tamoxifen is low in clinical practice. There were no socio-demographic differences in uptake, suggesting that the introduction of breast cancer preventive therapy is unlikely to create socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence. Women\u2019s decision-making was influenced by familial priorities, particularly having children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Chemoprevention", "Decision-making", "Medication", "Preventive therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemoprevention", "Decision Making", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Premedication", "Preventive Medicine", "Prospective Studies", "Public Health Surveillance", "Qualitative Research", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045848122", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55872959400": {"Name": "Hackett J.", "AuthorID": "55872959400", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "55568953200": {"Name": "Thorneloe R.", "AuthorID": "55568953200", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "55501030300": {"Name": "Smith S.G.", "AuthorID": "55501030300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57218348853": {"Name": "Side L.", "AuthorID": "57218348853", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Women\u2019s Health"}, "35239316000": {"Name": "Wolf M.", "AuthorID": "35239316000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, Northwestern University"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7103156622": {"Name": "Cuzick J.", "AuthorID": "7103156622", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
