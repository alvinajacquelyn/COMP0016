Objectives: This study aims to validate an electrophysiological test battery as a tool to diagnose patients with functional tremor with a \"laboratory-supported\" level of certainty. Methods: For this prospective data collection study, we recruited 38 new patients with functional tremor (mean age 37.9\u00b124.5 years; mean disease duration 5.9\u00b19.0 years) and 73 new patients with organic tremor (mean age 55.4\u00b125.4 years; mean disease duration 15.8\u00b117.7 years). Tremor was recorded at rest, posture (with and without loading), action, while performing tapping tasks (1, 3, and 5Hz), and while performing ballistic movements with the less-affected hand. Electrophysiological tests were performed by raters blinded to the clinical diagnosis. We calculated a sum score for all performed tests (maximum of 10 points) and used a previously suggested cut-off score of 3 points for a diagnosis of laboratory-supported functional tremor. Results: We demonstrated good interrater reliability and test-retest reliability. Patients with functional tremor had a higher average score on the test battery when compared with patients with organic tremor (3.6\u00b11.4 points vs 1.0\u00b10.8 points; P < .001), and the predefined cut-off score for laboratory-supported functional tremor yielded a test sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 95.9%. Conclusion: We now propose this test battery as the basis of laboratory-supported criteria for the diagnosis of functional tremor, and we encourage its use in clinical and research practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnostic criteria", "Electrophysiological criteria", "Functional", "Psychogenic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Adult", "Aged", "Electromyography", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurologic Examination", "Psychophysiologic Disorders", "Reproducibility of Results", "Single-Blind Method", "Tremor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959378250", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"25028758700": {"Name": "Schwingenschuh P.", "AuthorID": "25028758700", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Medical University of Graz"}, "55767667800": {"Name": "Katschnig-Winter P.", "AuthorID": "55767667800", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "55356980000": {"Name": "Koegl-Wallner M.", "AuthorID": "55356980000", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "56124722000": {"Name": "Culea V.", "AuthorID": "56124722000", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "56516921700": {"Name": "Ghadery C.", "AuthorID": "56516921700", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "55549313400": {"Name": "Hofer E.", "AuthorID": "55549313400", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz"}, "55958959600": {"Name": "Pendl T.", "AuthorID": "55958959600", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "56906710800": {"Name": "Seiler S.", "AuthorID": "56906710800", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "55959590700": {"Name": "Werner U.", "AuthorID": "55959590700", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "57148552400": {"Name": "Franthal S.", "AuthorID": "57148552400", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "57212615213": {"Name": "Schmidt R.", "AuthorID": "57212615213", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "36651432300": {"Name": "Saifee T.A.", "AuthorID": "36651432300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35722502400": {"Name": "Macerollo A.", "AuthorID": "35722502400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.J.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department for Cardiovascular and Cell Sciences, St. George's University of London"}, "35497253800": {"Name": "Maurits N.M.", "AuthorID": "35497253800", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7004162353": {"Name": "Tijssen M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004162353", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}}}
