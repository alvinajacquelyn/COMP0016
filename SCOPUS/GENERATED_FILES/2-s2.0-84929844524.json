Through exploring the ways in which two main policies are being enacted, \u2018Behaviour Management\u2019 and \u2018Standards and Attainment\u2019, we argue that policy type, power and positionality, space and time constraints, as well as different subjectivities, render policy enactment a more fragile and unstable process than is sometimes documented in policy analysis and implementation studies.
