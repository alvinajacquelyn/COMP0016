Pavlovian eyelid conditioning, because ofhowdirectly it engages the cerebellum, has helped revealmanyaspects of cerebellar learning and the underlying mechanisms. Theories of cerebellar learning assert that climbing fiber inputs control plasticity at synapses onto PCs, and thus PCs control the expression of learned responses. We tested this assertion by recording 184 eyelid PCs and 240 non-eyelid PCs during the expression of conditioned eyelid responses (CRs) in well trained rabbits. By contrasting the responses of eyelid and non-eyelid PCs and by contrasting the responses of eyelid PCs under conditions that produce differently timed CRs, we test the hypothesis that learning-related changes in eyelid PCs contribute to the learning and adaptive timing of the CRs. We used a variety of analyses to test the quantitative relationships between eyelid PC responses and the kinematic properties of the eyelid CRs. We find that the timing of eyelid PC responses varies systematically with the timing of the behavioral CRs and that there are differences in the magnitude of eyelid PC responses between larger-CR, smaller- CR, and non-CR trials. However, eyelid PC activity does not encode any single kinematic property of the behavioral CRs at a fixed time lag, nor does it linearly encode CR amplitude. Even so, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that learning-dependent changes in PC activity contribute to the adaptively timed expression of conditioned eyelid responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amplitude", "Cerebellum", "Eyelid conditioning", "Purkinje cell", "Tetrode recording", "Timing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Conditioning, Classical", "Eyelids", "Male", "Purkinje Cells", "Rabbits", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929692620", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6701468736": {"Name": "Halverson H.", "AuthorID": "6701468736", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Center for Learning and Memory, University of Texas at Austin"}, "56342484100": {"Name": "Khilkevich A.", "AuthorID": "56342484100", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Center for Learning and Memory, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7005813499": {"Name": "Mauk M.", "AuthorID": "7005813499", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas at Austin"}}}
