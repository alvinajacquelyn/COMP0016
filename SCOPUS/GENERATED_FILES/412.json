Methods: Content analysis of the ten most widely circulated print/digital news sources in the UK. Results: Seventy-nine articles were identified focusing on NIPT for Down syndrome (n=67) including single gene disorders (n=5), whole genome sequencing (n=8), NIPT technology (n=2), Rhesus D (n=1) and fetal sex determination (n=1). The majority (63%) were in 'serious' papers. Test attributes were frequently cited (100%), in particular that NIPT is a blood test (89%) and avoids risk of miscarriage (56%). The main psychosocial benefit reported was increased time for decision-making (15%). Concerns were discussed less frequently than benefits (39%), with increase in termination rates the main concern raised (23%). The majority of headlines (52%) projected a positive frame towards NIPT. Regarding overall framing of articles, over two thirds (68%) presented benefits and concerns or limitations; however, only a third (35%) were considered 'balanced'. Conclusion: Positive reporting of NIPT in the UK news media reflects the publics' broadly optimistic view towards genomic technology and prenatal testing. Health professionals should be aware that women may have incomplete information or misunderstandings about NIPT. Pre-test counselling to ensure informed decision-making is therefore important.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "DNA", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Genetic Testing", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Newspapers as Topic", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Sex Determination Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928390791", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics, UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56604728400": {"Name": "Choudhury M.", "AuthorID": "56604728400", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics, UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
