It theorises the nature of these streets, developing an analytical framework through which to investigate them through their four high street functions - physical fabric, exchange, movement and real estate - and the overarching question of management. It then explores the challenges and issues facing such streets in British cities before turning specifically to the London case. Through a complimentary set of empirical investigations, London's local high streets are explored across two scales, in terms of their strategic city-wide contribution, and through their local impact. They are examined both with regard to their situation today and their future potential. The policy context across London is also, explored, before conclusions and recommendations are drawn out of relevance to London and to mixed street corridors across the world. Mixed streets represent a particularly 'wicked' problem for cities, yet, as the research shows, they are also some of the most important spaces in the city, of far greater complexity and local significance than is realised, and possessing untapped strategic growth potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High streets", "London", "Main streets", "Mixed street corridors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941315554", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7102234035": {"Name": "Carmona M.", "AuthorID": "7102234035", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, UCL"}}}
