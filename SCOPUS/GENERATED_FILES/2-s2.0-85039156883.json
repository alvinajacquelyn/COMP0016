Thus, new methods that enable the covalent and precise installation of targeting antibodies to nanoparticle surfaces are greatly desired, especially those which do not rely on costly and time-consuming antibody engineering techniques. Herein we present a novel method for the highly controlled and oriented covalent conjugation of non-engineered antibody F(ab) fragments to PLGA-PEG nanoparticles using disulfide-selective pyridazinedione linkers and strain-promoted alkyne-azide click chemistry. Exemplification of this method with trastuzumab and cetuximab showed significant improvements in both conjugation efficiency and antigen binding capability, when compared to commonly employed strategies for antibody-nanoparticle construction. This new approach paves the way for the development of antibody-targeted nanomedicines with improved paratope availability, reproducibility and uniformity to enhance both biological activity and ease of manufacture.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibody engineering", "Antibody fragment", "Antibody-targeted", "Antigen binding", "Click chemistry", "Nanoparticle conjugate", "Nanoparticle surface", "Reproducibilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039156883", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"55974561500": {"Name": "Greene M.K.", "AuthorID": "55974561500", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"}, "57200890299": {"Name": "Smyth P.", "AuthorID": "57200890299", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"}, "35564292100": {"Name": "Scott C.J.", "AuthorID": "35564292100", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"}, "57037847400": {"Name": "Richards D.A.", "AuthorID": "57037847400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57193137155": {"Name": "Nogueira J.C.F.", "AuthorID": "57193137155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200081200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez M.", "AuthorID": "57200081200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24536976100": {"Name": "Chudasama V.", "AuthorID": "24536976100", "AffiliationID": "60016187, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Medicines (IMed.ULisboa), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "16202006900": {"Name": "Campbell K.", "AuthorID": "16202006900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Food Security, School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"}}}
