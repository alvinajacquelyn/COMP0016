Methods: In this prospective case series, the authors acquired digital face photographs of 409 children with manifest or latent strabismus, using a 14-million-pixel camera with CCD image sensor. Of the last 52 enrolled, 34 image sets were selected for this study: 29 with manifest and 5 with latent strabismus. Images were taken at a distance of 40 to 70 cm in primary position, with the camera lens as the fixation target and in slight off-center fixation, and using a novel target of small light-emitting diodes mounted onto the camera case. The location of the corneal light reflection was manually calculated in relation to the center of the pupil in both eyes and ocular deviation as the difference in corneal light reflection location between the two eyes. In orthotropia, the expected deviation is zero. Results: In children with phorias, the mean corneal light reflection location difference between the eyes was -0.10 \u00b1 0.14 mm in primary position and -2.02 \u00b1 0.39 mm in off-center fixation. Using a threshold of \u00b10.5 mm on either side of zero for central and of 2 mm for off-center fixation, sensitivity to detect strabismus increased from 65.6% in central to 79.3% in off-center fixation, respectively. The calculation of specificity will require inclusion of a population of individuals without strabismus. Conclusions: Off-center fixation onto a near target ensures that participants are actively looking at the target and may increase accommodative effort, thereby increasing the detection rate of strabismus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Male", "Photography", "Prospective Studies", "Pupil", "Reproducibility of Results", "Strabismus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016195128", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57193739290": {"Name": "Maor R.", "AuthorID": "57193739290", "AffiliationID": "118273129", "AffiliationName": "IRISS Medical Technologies Ltd."}, "57193733785": {"Name": "Barnard S.", "AuthorID": "57193733785", "AffiliationID": "60072445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry, School of Health Sciences, Hadassah Academic College"}, "57193739982": {"Name": "Yashiv Y.", "AuthorID": "57193739982", "AffiliationID": "118273129", "AffiliationName": "IRISS Medical Technologies Ltd."}, "57193736678": {"Name": "Holland J.", "AuthorID": "57193736678", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55281650200": {"Name": "Tailor V.", "AuthorID": "55281650200", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56601468700": {"Name": "Banteka M.", "AuthorID": "56601468700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "22950013600": {"Name": "Dahlmann-Noor A.H.", "AuthorID": "22950013600", "AffiliationID": "60029898", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields at Bedford Hospital"}, "57201513512": {"Name": "Khandelwal P.", "AuthorID": "57201513512", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "South Essex Partnership Foundation Trust"}, "57090442300": {"Name": "Glaze S.", "AuthorID": "57090442300", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "South Essex Partnership Foundation Trust"}}}
