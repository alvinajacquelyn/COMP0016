Here, we give a fully self-contained, easy-to-follow, but fully detailed , direct and constructive proof of the undecidability of a very simple Horn-like fragment of linear logic, which is accessible to a wide range of people. Namely, we show that there is a direct correspondence between terminated computations of a Minsky machine M and cut-free linear logic derivations for a Horn-like sequent of the form !\u03a6M, l1 - l0, where \u03a6M consists only of Horn-like implications of the following simple forms (l - l\u2032), ((l \u2297 r) - l\u2032), (l - (r \u2297 l\u2032)), and (l - (l\u2032 \u2297 l\u2033)), where l1, l0, l, l\u2032, l\u2033 and r stand for literals. Neither negation, nor &, nor constants, nor embedded implications/bangs are used here. Furthermore, our particular correspondence constructed above provides decidability for each of the Horn-like fragments whenever we confine ourselves to any two forms of the above Horn-like implications, along with the complexity bounds that come from the proof.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complexity bounds", "Constructive proof", "Decision problems", "Linear logic", "Literals", "Undecidability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014346322", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56117921300": {"Name": "Kanovich M.", "AuthorID": "56117921300", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "National Research University Higher School of Economics"}}}
