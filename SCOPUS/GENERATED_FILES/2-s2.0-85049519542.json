Phenobarbital remains the first line drug therapy for the treatment of suspected neonatal seizures but concerns remain with efficacy and safety. Here we explored the short-And long-Term outcomes of phenobarbital treatment in a mouse model of hypoxia-induced neonatal seizures. Seizures were induced in P7 mice by exposure to 5% O2 for 15 minutes. Immediately after hypoxia, pups received a single dose of phenobarbital (25 mg.kg-1) or saline. We observed that after administration of phenobarbital seizure burden and number of seizures were reduced compared to the hypoxic period; however, PhB did not suppress acute histopathology. Behavioural analysis of mice at 5 weeks of age previously subjected to hypoxia-seizures revealed an increase in anxiety-like behaviour and impaired memory function compared to control littermates, and these effects were not normalized by phenobarbital. In a seizure susceptibility test, pups previously exposed to hypoxia, with or without phenobarbital, developed longer and more severe seizures in response to kainic acid injection compared to control mice. Unexpectedly, mice treated with phenobarbital developed less hippocampal damage after kainic acid than untreated counterparts. The present study suggests phenobarbital treatment in immature mice does not improve the long lasting functional deficits induces by hypoxia-induced seizures but, unexpectedly, may reduce neuronal death caused by exposure to a second seizure event in later life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Anticonvulsants", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Hypoxia", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Kainic Acid", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Phenobarbital", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049519542", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57188670386": {"Name": "Quinlan S.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57188670386", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "56183488700": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Alvarez N.", "AuthorID": "56183488700", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "7004070560": {"Name": "Henshall D.C.", "AuthorID": "7004070560", "AffiliationID": "60113732", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT)"}, "36955280200": {"Name": "Jimenez-Mateos E.M.", "AuthorID": "36955280200", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "6603848328": {"Name": "Molloy E.J.", "AuthorID": "6603848328", "AffiliationID": "60020035", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin"}, "36839602200": {"Name": "Madden S.F.", "AuthorID": "36839602200", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Data Science Centre, Beaux Lane House, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.B.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}}}
