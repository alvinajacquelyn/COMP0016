An extension of this treatment to a system with more complicated internal structure \u2013 HCN/HNC (hydrogen cyanide/hydrogen isocyanide) is presented. A highly accurate spectroscopically-determined PES is built based on a recent ab initio PES of the HCN/HNC isomerizing system. 588 levels of HCN with J = (0, 2, 5, 9, 10) are reproduced with a standard deviation from the experimental values of \u03c3=0.0373 cm\u22121 and 101 HNC levels with J = (0, 2) are reproduced with \u03c3=0.37 cm\u22121. The dependence of the HCN rovibrational transition intensities on the PES is tested for the wavenumbers below 7200 cm\u22121. Intensities are computed using wavefunctions generated from an ab initio and our optimized PES. These intensities differ from each other by more than 1% for about 11% of the transitions tested, showing the need to use an optimized PES to obtain wavefunctions for high-accuracy predictions of transition intensities. An ab initio DMS is computed for HCN geometries lying below 11,200 cm\u22121. Intensities for HCN transitions are calculated using a new fitted PES and newly calculated DMS. The resulting intensities compare much better with experiment than previous calculations. In particular, intensities of the H\u2013C stretching and bending fundamental transitions are predicted with the subpercent accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dipole moment surfaces", "Experimental values", "Hydrogen Cyanide", "Internal structure", "Rovibrational transitions", "Small molecules", "Standard deviation", "Transition intensity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053753648", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57200597363": {"Name": "Makhnev V.Y.", "AuthorID": "57200597363", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Science"}, "55901670600": {"Name": "Kyuberis A.A.", "AuthorID": "55901670600", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Science"}, "7006554518": {"Name": "Polyansky O.L.", "AuthorID": "7006554518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54891364400": {"Name": "Mizus I.I.", "AuthorID": "54891364400", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Science"}, "35583085500": {"Name": "Zobov N.F.", "AuthorID": "35583085500", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Science"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
