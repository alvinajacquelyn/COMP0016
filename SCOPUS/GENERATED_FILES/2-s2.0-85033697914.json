This form of physical asymmetry occurs in several metazoan cells, but the underlying mechanisms and function are incompletely understood. Here we use Drosophila neural stem cells to elucidate the mechanisms involved in physical asymmetry establishment. We show that Myosin relocalizes to the cleavage furrow via two distinct cortical Myosin flows: at anaphase onset, a polarity induced, basally directed Myosin flow clears Myosin from the apical cortex. Subsequently, mitotic spindle cues establish a Myosin gradient at the lateral neuroblast cortex, necessary to trigger an apically directed flow, removing Actomyosin from the basal cortex. On the basis of the data presented here, we propose that spatiotemporally controlled Myosin flows in conjunction with spindle positioning and spindle asymmetry are key determinants for correct cleavage furrow placement and cortical expansion, thereby establishing physical asymmetry.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actomyosin", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Brain", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Size", "Chromatin", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors", "Larva", "Myosins", "Neural Stem Cells", "Spindle Apparatus", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033697914", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36467062900": {"Name": "Roubinet C.", "AuthorID": "36467062900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57194850481": {"Name": "Tsankova A.", "AuthorID": "57194850481", "AffiliationID": "119761572", "AffiliationName": "Streuli Pharma AG Switzerland"}, "56253919000": {"Name": "Pham T.", "AuthorID": "56253919000", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Washington, 24 Kincaid Hall"}, "57196723355": {"Name": "Monnard A.", "AuthorID": "57196723355", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Washington, 24 Kincaid Hall"}, "24472470700": {"Name": "Caussinus E.", "AuthorID": "24472470700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich"}, "57203081523": {"Name": "Affolter M.", "AuthorID": "57203081523", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "13907504800": {"Name": "Cabernard C.", "AuthorID": "13907504800", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Washington, 24 Kincaid Hall"}}}
