KGaA, Weinheim.The total synthesis of oxazolidinone-based pharmaceuticals, linezolid, tedizolid and rivaroxaban is reported. They are synthesized using a recently reported copper-catalyzed one-pot cyclization and arylation as the key step to construct the N-aryloxazolidinone core. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) were synthesized from a common synthetic pool of a simple protected amino alcohol in 22 %, 61 % and 40 % total synthesis yields, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Copper", "Cross coupling", "Homogeneous catalysis", "Nitrogen heterocycles", "Total synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960225679", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55587741500": {"Name": "Mahy W.", "AuthorID": "55587741500", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, University of Bath"}, "7101816927": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816927", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "57130325700": {"Name": "Leitch J.", "AuthorID": "57130325700", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}}}
