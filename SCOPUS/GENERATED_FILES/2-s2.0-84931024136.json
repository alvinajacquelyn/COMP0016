We studied how contrast affects early perceptual face processing by measuring the face-sensitive N170 component to face images when the contrast of the eyes and of the rest of the face was independently manipulated. Fixation was either located on the eye region or on the lower part of a face. Contrast-reversal of the eyes triggered delayed and enhanced N170 components independently of the contrast of other face parts, and regardless of gaze location. Similar N170 modulations were observed when the rest of a face was contrast-inverted, but only when gaze was directed away from the eyes. Results demonstrate that the contrast of the eyes and of other face parts can both affect face perception, but that the contrast polarity of the eye region has a privileged role during early stages of face processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contrast inversion", "event-related brain potentials", "Face perception", "N170 component"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Contrast Sensitivity", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Eye", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Male", "Social Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931024136", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56684209300": {"Name": "Fisher K.", "AuthorID": "56684209300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "55250224100": {"Name": "Towler J.", "AuthorID": "55250224100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7005587916": {"Name": "Eimer M.", "AuthorID": "7005587916", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
