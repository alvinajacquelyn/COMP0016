Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Objectives A short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of two pedometer-based walking interventions compared with usual care. Design (A) Short-term CEA: Parallel three-arm cluster randomised trial randomised by household. (B) Long-term CEA: Markov decision model. Setting Seven primary care practices in South London, UK. Participants (A) Short-term CEA: 1023 people (922 households) aged 45-75 years without physical activity (PA) contraindications. (b) Long-term CEA: A cohort of 100 000 people aged 59-88 years. Interventions Pedometers, 12-week walking programmes and PA diaries delivered by post or through three PA consultations with practice nurses. Primary and secondary outcome measures Accelerometer-measured change (baseline to 12 months) in average daily step count and time in 10 min bouts of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), and EQ-5D-5L quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Methods Resource use costs (\u00a32013/2014) from a National Health Service perspective, presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each outcome over a 1-year and lifetime horizon, with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and willingness to pay per QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluate uncertainty. Results (A) Short-term CEA: At 12 months, incremental cost was \u00a33.61 (\u00a3109)/min in \u226510 min MVPA bouts for nurse support compared with control (postal group). At \u00a320 000/QALY, the postal group had a 50% chance of being cost saving compared with control. (B) Long-term CEA: The postal group had more QALYs (+759 QALYs, 95% CI 400 to 1247) and lower costs (-\u00a311 million, 95% CI -12 to -10) than control and nurse groups, resulting in an incremental net monetary benefit of \u00a326 million per 100 000 population. Results were sensitive to reporting serious adverse events, excluding health service use, and including all participant costs. Conclusions Postal delivery of a pedometer intervention in primary care is cost-effective long term and has a 50% chance of being cost-effective, through resource savings, within 1 year. Further research should ascertain maintenance of the higher levels of PA, and its impact on quality of life and health service use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cost-effectiveness", "long-term modelling", "physical activity", "RCT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actigraphy", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Fitness Trackers", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Markov Chains", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Nurses", "Postal Service", "Primary Health Care", "Program Evaluation", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Residence Characteristics", "Self Efficacy", "Sex Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055075342", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"36990301200": {"Name": "Anokye N.", "AuthorID": "36990301200", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Group, Brunel University"}, "7003578733": {"Name": "Fox-Rushby J.", "AuthorID": "7003578733", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Guy's Campus, King's College London"}, "55611386600": {"Name": "Sanghera S.", "AuthorID": "55611386600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7403472903": {"Name": "Cook D.", "AuthorID": "7403472903", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "6602321413": {"Name": "Limb E.", "AuthorID": "6602321413", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "55887868500": {"Name": "Furness C.", "AuthorID": "55887868500", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603960588": {"Name": "Ussher M.", "AuthorID": "6603960588", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "8625662800": {"Name": "Dewilde S.", "AuthorID": "8625662800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "7402722934": {"Name": "Harris T.", "AuthorID": "7402722934", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "7004763334": {"Name": "Kerry S.", "AuthorID": "7004763334", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit, Queen Mary's University of London"}, "21647459300": {"Name": "Victor C.", "AuthorID": "21647459300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Brunel University London"}, "57203258140": {"Name": "Ekelund U.", "AuthorID": "57203258140", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}}}
