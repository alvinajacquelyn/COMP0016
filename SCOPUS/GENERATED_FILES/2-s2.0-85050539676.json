After accounting for the potential endogeneity of the indicator of power distribution within the household, related to assortative mating in the marriage market, this paper shows that maternal power is more positively associated with girls\u2019 nutrition than boys\u2019. Among households located in rural areas, resource allocation between girls and boys seems to differ. Similarly, some evidence of competition for household resources affecting girls\u2019 nutrition is found.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "Intrahousehold allocations", "nutrition", "Peru"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050539676", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"57191089671": {"Name": "Novella R.", "AuthorID": "57191089671", "AffiliationID": "60007869", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Department of International Development & Inter-American Development Bank"}}}
