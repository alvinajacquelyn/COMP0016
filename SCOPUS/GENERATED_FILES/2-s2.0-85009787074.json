However, to achieve a high figure of merit, chemical doping is necessary to increase the electrical conductivity. In the present work, we examined the thermoelectric figure of merit for CH3NH3PbI3 as a function of carrier concentration based on first-principles calculations. For doped semiconductors, the impurity scattering usually plays a dominant role in the charge transport. Both impurity scattering and acoustic phonon scattering have been incorporated in our calculations. We showed that at the impurity concentration of 1018 cm\u22123, the room temperature zT value of tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 could be optimized to reach unity at the carrier concentration on the same order of magnitude as 1018 cm\u22123. The hole-doped CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits superior thermoelectric property than the electron-doped one, and we propose to engineer the vacancies of organic cations for the enhanced hole concentration and thermoelectric efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["First-principles calculations", "Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite", "Thermoelectric transport"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic-phonon scattering", "First-principles calculation", "Organic-inorganic hybrid", "Thermoelectric application", "Thermoelectric efficiency", "Thermoelectric figure of merit", "Thermoelectric properties", "Thermoelectric transport"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009787074", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57213653802": {"Name": "Zhao T.", "AuthorID": "57213653802", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Organic OptoElectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "55628533018": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "55628533018", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Organic OptoElectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "7004784475": {"Name": "Shuai Z.", "AuthorID": "7004784475", "AffiliationID": "60026601, 60019499, 60102074", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Science (BNLMS), Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
