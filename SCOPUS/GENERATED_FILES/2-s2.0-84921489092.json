This review outlines key process economic drivers for hPSCs and progress made on improving the economic and operational feasibility of hPSC bioprocesses. Factors influencing key cost metrics, namely capital investment and cost of goods, for hPSCs are discussed. Step efficiencies particularly for differentiation, media requirements and technology choice are amongst the key process economic drivers identified for hPSCs. Progress made to address these cost drivers in hPSC bioprocessing strategies is discussed. These include improving expansion and differentiation yields in planar and bioreactor technologies, the development of xeno-free media and microcarrier coatings, identification of optimal bioprocess operating conditions to control cell fate and the development of directed differentiation protocols that reduce reliance on expensive morphogens such as growth factors and small molecules. These approaches offer methods to further optimise hPSC bioprocessing in terms of its commercial feasibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioprocess economics", "Cell therapy", "Pluripotent stem cells", "Regenerative medicine", "Scale-up"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioprocesses", "Cell therapy", "Pluripotent stem cells", "Regenerative medicine", "Scale-up", "Bioreactors", "Biotechnology", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Humans", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Regenerative Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921489092", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"56489622400": {"Name": "Jenkins M.", "AuthorID": "56489622400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005343335": {"Name": "Farid S.", "AuthorID": "7005343335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
