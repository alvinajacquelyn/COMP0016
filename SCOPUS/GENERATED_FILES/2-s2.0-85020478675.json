Surprisingly, functional details of \u03b33\u03b4T cell antimicrobial immunity to infection remain largely unexplored. Limited data suggests that \u03b33\u03b4T cells can phagocytose particles and act as professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPC). These potential functions, however, remain controversial. To better understand \u03b33\u03b4T cell-bacterial interactions, an ex vivo co-culture model of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to Escherichia coli was employed. V\u03b339V\u03b42 cells underwent rapid T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent proliferation and functional transition from cytotoxic, inflammatory cytokine immunity, to cell expansion with diminished cytokine but increased costimulatory molecule expression, and capacity for professional phagocytosis. Phagocytosis was augmented by IgG opsonization, and inhibited by TCR-blockade, suggesting a licensing interaction involving the TCR and Fc\u03b33R. V\u03b339V\u03b42 cells displayed potent cytotoxicity through TCR-dependent and independent mechanisms. We conclude that \u03b33\u03b4T cells transition from early inflammatory cytotoxic killers to myeloid-like APC in response to infectious stimuli.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["B7-2 Antigen", "Cytokines", "Escherichia coli", "HLA-DR Antigens", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Phagocytes", "Phagocytosis", "Phenotype", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta", "T-Lymphocytes", "Th1 Cells", "Zoledronic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020478675", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55883527700": {"Name": "Barisa M.", "AuthorID": "55883527700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection,Immunity and Inflammation Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57061688800": {"Name": "Kramer A.M.", "AuthorID": "57061688800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection,Immunity and Inflammation Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "43761631400": {"Name": "Saraiva L.", "AuthorID": "43761631400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection,Immunity and Inflammation Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6603047821": {"Name": "Bajaj-Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "6603047821", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection,Immunity and Inflammation Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7005333544": {"Name": "Gustafsson K.", "AuthorID": "7005333544", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection,Immunity and Inflammation Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57194501749": {"Name": "Majani Y.", "AuthorID": "57194501749", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6603183187": {"Name": "Moulding D.", "AuthorID": "6603183187", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
