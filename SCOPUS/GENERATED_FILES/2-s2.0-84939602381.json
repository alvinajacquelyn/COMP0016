Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.We consider the transmission eigenvalue problem for an impenetrable obstacle with Dirichlet boundary condition surrounded by a thin layer of non-absorbing inhomogeneous material. We derive a rigorous asymptotic expansion for the first transmission eigenvalue with respect to the thickness of the thin layer. Our convergence analysis is based on a Max-Min principle and an iterative approach which involves estimates on the corresponding eigenfunctions. We provide explicit expressions for the terms in the asymptotic expansion up to order 3.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asymptotic methods", "inverse scattering", "thin layers", "transmission eigenvalues"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic method", "Convergence analysis", "Dirichlet boundary condition", "Inhomogeneous materials", "Inverse scattering", "Thin layers", "Transmission eigenvalue", "Transmission eigenvalues"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939602381", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"6602095401": {"Name": "Cakoni F.", "AuthorID": "6602095401", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Delaware"}, "49360963100": {"Name": "Chaulet N.", "AuthorID": "49360963100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6603405068": {"Name": "Haddar H.", "AuthorID": "6603405068", "AffiliationID": "60105987, 60105988", "AffiliationName": "INRIA Saclay Ile de France, CMAP Ecole Polytechnique"}}}
