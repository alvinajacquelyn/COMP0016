He had a previous history of AMP-kinase disease associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and complete heart block, and a pre-existing dual chamber pacemaker. He also had a mechanical tricuspid valve replacement and mitral valve replacement, for severe tricuspid regurgitation from right ventricle (RV) lead-induced injury to the tricuspid valve and a fibroblastoma on the mitral valve. His pre-existing RV lead was maintained between the prosthetic valve annulus and the native annulus. Inability to place an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the RV due to the presence of a mechanical tricuspid valve replacement represented a rare but challenging clinical scenario. Surgical epicardial lead placement or the use of a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) were possible alternatives. Traditional ICD lead placement was favored because of the broad QRS from RV pacing meaning that use of the S-ICD was not possible due to failure of the electrocardiogram to lie within the bounds of the screening template, and the perceived high risk of repeat thoracotomy. We describe the technique for ICD lead placement in a mid-lateral cardiac venous branch of the coronary sinus with the ability to deliver anti-tachycardia pacing and cardiac resynchronization. To our knowledge this is the first report of an ICD in the mid-lateral cardiac vein, with cardiac resynchronization. Learning objective: This case describes the technique for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in the coronary sinus with biventricular pacing in a patient with a mechanical tricuspid and pre-existing right ventricular endocardial lead. This technique represents a viable alternative to repeat thoracotomy and surgical lead placement, where the risks of complication, prolonged hospital stay and lead failure are high. It also offers the ability to deliver anti-tachycardia pacing and cardiac resynchronization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AMP-kinase disease", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator", "Mechanical tricuspid valve replacement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949087093", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56800023900": {"Name": "Srinivasan N.T.", "AuthorID": "56800023900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, UCL"}, "7004204877": {"Name": "Segal O.R.", "AuthorID": "7004204877", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College Hospital"}}}
