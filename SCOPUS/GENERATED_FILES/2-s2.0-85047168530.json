Thomas and Dikaios Sakellariou; individual chapters, the contributors.This chapter begins with an ethnographic contribution from post-Ebola Sierra Leone, illustrating how in order to understand the differences between impairment, disease, and disability, there is a need to understand \u2018ordinary ethics\u2019. I begin by illustrating what this means through the unmaking of ethical practices during the Ebola epidemic in terms of, for example, caring relationships and social obligations of kinship. Second, I illustrate how post-Ebola disability as disablement is displayed as afflictive kinship when it is no longer possible to remake ethical life because bonds of kinship do not function. Third, I give two examples of the ways in which a biomedical public reconstruction of social ethics has only led to disability and disablement for people living with consequences of Ebola.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047168530", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"12243132000": {"Name": "Berghs M.", "AuthorID": "12243132000", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "De Montfort University"}}}
