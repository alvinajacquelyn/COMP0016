We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature comparing use of a PFS with alternate treatment strategies. Methods: Studies comparing the use of a PFS with alternate strategies were identified and data extracted. The primary outcome measure was length of time on a ventilator. Mean difference (MD) between continuous variables and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Risk difference and 95 % CI were determined for dichotomous data. Results: Eighteen studies, including one randomised controlled trial, were included. Treatment strategy and outcome measures reported varied widely. Meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in days of ventilation, but a longer duration of parenteral nutrition (PN) requirement [MD 6.4 days (1.3, 11.5); p = 0.01] in infants who received a PFS. Subgroup analysis of studies reporting routine use of a PFS for all infants demonstrated a significantly shorter duration of ventilation with a PFS [MD 2.2 days (0.5, 3.9); p = 0.01] but no difference in duration of PN requirement. Other outcomes were similar between groups. Conclusion: The quality of evidence comparing PFS with alternate treatment strategies for gastroschisis is poor. Only routine use of PFS is associated with fewer days on a ventilator compared with other strategies. No strong evidence to support a preference for any strategy was demonstrated. Prospective studies are required to investigate the optimum management of gastroschisis. Standardised outcome measures for this population should be established to allow comparison of studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abdominal wall defect", "Gastroschisis", "Meta-analysis", "Neonatal surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gastroschisis", "Humans", "Infant", "Length of Stay", "Parenteral Nutrition", "Respiration, Artificial", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939940487", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"15769973200": {"Name": "Ross A.R.", "AuthorID": "15769973200", "AffiliationID": "112749696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "112749696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7003624486": {"Name": "Zani A.", "AuthorID": "7003624486", "AffiliationID": "112749696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602748899": {"Name": "Ade-Ajayi N.", "AuthorID": "6602748899", "AffiliationID": "112749696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "112749696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7201554532": {"Name": "Hall N.J.", "AuthorID": "7201554532", "AffiliationID": "112749696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery and Urology, Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
