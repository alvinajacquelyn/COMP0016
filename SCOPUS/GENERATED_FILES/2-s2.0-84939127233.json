Wefind that the average phonon number, purity and quantum squeezing of the steady-states can all be made more non-classical through the addition of time-continuous measurement.Wepredict that the continuous monitoring of the system, together with Markovian feedback, allows one to stabilize the dynamics for any value of the laser frequency driving the cavity. By considering state of the art values of the experimental parameters, we prove that one can in principle obtain a non-classical (squeezed) steadystatewith an average phonon number n<inf>ph</inf> \u2248 0.5.", "AuthorKeywords": ["quantum feedback control", "quantum optomechanics", "quantum state engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous measurements", "Continuous monitoring", "Experimental parameters", "Optical cavities", "Quantum feedback control", "Quantum optomechanics", "Quantum-state engineering", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939127233", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8977729200": {"Name": "Genoni M.", "AuthorID": "8977729200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22985827000": {"Name": "Millen J.", "AuthorID": "22985827000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006026939": {"Name": "Serafini A.", "AuthorID": "7006026939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57201893000": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57201893000", "AffiliationID": "60030674", "AffiliationName": "Scuola Normale Superiore"}}}
