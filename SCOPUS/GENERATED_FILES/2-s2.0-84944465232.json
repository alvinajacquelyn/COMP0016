The single-stage exchange procedure is becoming increasingly popular with promising results. At our Institute we have demonstrated favourable or similar outcomes compared to the 'gold-standard' two-stage exchange, and other published single-stage results. The aim of this study is to describe the patient selection criteria and perioperative steps in a single-stage exchange for hip and knee arthroplasty undertaken at our Institute. The outlined protocol can be performed using standard debridement, attention to detail and well-recognised reconstructive techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hip exchange arthroplasty", "Knee exchange arthroplasty", "Patient selection", "Periprosthetic joint infections", "Single-stage exchange", "Surgical technique"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arthritis, Infectious", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Debridement", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Knee Prosthesis", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "Reoperation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944465232", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57200399194": {"Name": "George D.A.", "AuthorID": "57200399194", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London"}}}
