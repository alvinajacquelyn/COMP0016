Such data are important to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of oral HPV and the potential use of vaccines to prevent oropharyngeal cancers. Methods Paired oral rinse samples and anogenital samples were available from 151 HIV-negative MSM within a larger cross-sectional survey. All samples were tested in parallel for 21 types of HPV DNA using an inhouse assay. Results The median age of participants was 30 (IQR 2535). The prevalence of any oral HPV and of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was 13.7% (n=21; 95% CI 8.7 to 20.2) and 5.9% (n=9; 95% CI 2.7 to 10.9) compared with 64.9% (n=98; 95% CI 56.7 to 72.5) and 34.4% (n=52; 95% CI 26.9 to 42.6) in any anogenital sample, respectively. The prevalence of types prevented by the bivalent (HPV16/18), quadrivalent (HPV6/11/16/18) and nonavalent (HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) vaccines was 1.3% (95% CI 0.2 to 4.7), 2.6% (95% CI 0.7 to 6.6) and 4.6% (95% CI 1.9 to 9.3), respectively. There was no concordance between HPV genotypes detected in oral and anogenital sites. Conclusions HR-HPV DNA, including HPV 16/18, was detected in oral specimens from HIV-negative MSM attending sexual health clinics, suggesting a potential role for vaccination, but is far less common than anogenital infection. How this relates to the risk and natural history of HPV-related head and neck cancers warrants further study. Lack of concordance with anogenital infection also suggests that oral HPV infection should be considered separately when estimating potential vaccine impact.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anal Canal", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genitalia, Male", "Genotype", "Homosexuality, Male", "Human Papillomavirus DNA Tests", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Mouth", "Oropharyngeal Neoplasms", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Papillomavirus Vaccines", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930571257", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56562442700": {"Name": "King E.M.", "AuthorID": "56562442700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "56562665800": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "56562665800", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36910371700": {"Name": "Young C.", "AuthorID": "36910371700", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "6601961353": {"Name": "Beddows S.", "AuthorID": "6601961353", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "55923872800": {"Name": "Panwar K.", "AuthorID": "55923872800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "6701456519": {"Name": "Soldan K.", "AuthorID": "6701456519", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "23990626200": {"Name": "Jit M.", "AuthorID": "23990626200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7006629172": {"Name": "Edmunds W.J.", "AuthorID": "7006629172", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
