Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data were compared with theoretically simulated STM images generated by density functional theory electronic structure calculations. Excellent agreement between experiment and simulation was found when using an adopted structural model that assumes partial removal of the surface Ge dimers in the [1-10] surface direction and subsequent addition of a single Ba atom to the substrate second layer. Structural assignments for a number of defects observed within regions of the 2\u00d73 reconstruction were also obtained.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969194619", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"9732685500": {"Name": "Koczorowski W.", "AuthorID": "9732685500", "AffiliationID": "60008555", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Poznan University of Technology"}, "55773620000": {"Name": "Grzela T.", "AuthorID": "55773620000", "AffiliationID": "60008555", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Poznan University of Technology"}, "7005534699": {"Name": "Czajka R.", "AuthorID": "7005534699", "AffiliationID": "60008555", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Poznan University of Technology"}, "7003875227": {"Name": "Radny M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003875227", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle"}, "55484945200": {"Name": "Puchalska A.", "AuthorID": "55484945200", "AffiliationID": "60016147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Wroclaw"}, "7003551319": {"Name": "Jurczyszyn L.", "AuthorID": "7003551319", "AffiliationID": "60016147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Wroclaw"}, "7006018442": {"Name": "Schofield S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006018442", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "6701786801": {"Name": "Curson N.J.", "AuthorID": "6701786801", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}}}
