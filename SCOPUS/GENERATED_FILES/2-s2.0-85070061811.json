{"Title": "FunFam protein families improve residue level molecular function prediction", "Year": 2019, "Source": "BMC Bioinformatics", "Volume": "20", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 400, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1186/s12859-019-2988-x", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85070061811&origin=inward", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The CATH database provides a hierarchical classification of protein domain structures including a sub-classification of superfamilies into functional families (FunFams). We analyzed the similarity of binding site annotations in these FunFams and incorporated FunFams into the prediction of protein binding residues. RESULTS: FunFam members agreed, on average, in 36.9 \u00b1 0.6% of their binding residue annotations. This constituted a 6.7-fold increase over randomly grouped proteins and a 1.2-fold increase (1.1-fold on the same dataset) over proteins with the same enzymatic function (identical Enzyme Commission, EC, number). Mapping de novo binding residue prediction methods (BindPredict-CCS, BindPredict-CC) onto FunFam resulted in consensus predictions for those residues that were aligned and predicted alike (binding/non-binding) within a FunFam. This simple consensus increased the F1-score (for binding) 1.5-fold over the original prediction method. Variation of the threshold for how many proteins in the consensus prediction had to agree provided a convenient control of accuracy/precision and coverage/recall, e.g. reaching a precision as high as 60.8 \u00b1 0.4% for a stringent threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The FunFams outperformed even the carefully curated EC numbers in terms of agreement of binding site residues. Additionally, we assume that our proof-of-principle through the prediction of protein binding residues will be relevant for many other solutions profiting from FunFams to infer functional information at the residue level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binding residue prediction", "CATH", "Functional families", "Protein binding sites", "Protein families", "Protein function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Databases, Protein", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070061811", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57210257537": {"Name": "Scheibenreif L.", "AuthorID": "57210257537", "AffiliationID": "60117797, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology - i12, TUM (Technical University of Munich)"}, "57208396597": {"Name": "Littmann M.", "AuthorID": "57208396597", "AffiliationID": "60117797, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology - i12, TUM (Technical University of Munich)"}, "55251517100": {"Name": "Rost B.", "AuthorID": "55251517100", "AffiliationID": "60030162, 60075062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics & New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS), Columbia University"}, "7006781333": {"Name": "Orengo C.", "AuthorID": "7006781333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
