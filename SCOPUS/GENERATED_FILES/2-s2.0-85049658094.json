Methods: In a single center, prospective, non-randomized mechanistic study, blood samples were collected from eight healthy controls and nine BCR patients, and subjected to biochemical and hematological tests, as well as RBC indices assessment using dual-beam optical tweezers. Results: The mean age of the controls was 52.37 \u00b1 10.70 years and BCR patients was 53.44 \u00b1 12.39 years. Initial cell size (Io) for the controls was 8.48 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bcm and 8.87 \u00b1 0.31 \u03bcm for BCR RBCs (p = 0.014). The deformability index (DI) for the controls was 0.066 \u00b1 0.02 and that for BCR RBCs was 0.063 \u00b1 0.03 (p = 0.441). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in DI between RBCs from BCR and healthy controls. This may explain the rare occurrence of retinal vascular occlusion despite the underlying vasculitic pathophysiology of BCR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Birdshot chorioretinopathy", "dual-beam optical tweezers", "RBC deformability", "red blood cell (RBC)", "vascular occlusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Birdshot Chorioretinopathy", "Erythrocyte Deformability", "Erythrocytes", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Optical Tweezers", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Artery Occlusion", "Retinal Vasculitis", "Retinal Vein Occlusion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049658094", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7201475180": {"Name": "Agrawal R.", "AuthorID": "7201475180", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57189688054": {"Name": "Cardoso J.", "AuthorID": "57189688054", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57210687832": {"Name": "Ang B.", "AuthorID": "57210687832", "AffiliationID": "60002481, 60095080", "AffiliationName": "National Healthcare Group Eye Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "7004710153": {"Name": "Shima D.", "AuthorID": "7004710153", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "36088786100": {"Name": "Balne P.K.", "AuthorID": "36088786100", "AffiliationID": "60024285", "AffiliationName": "Translational Pre-Clinical Model Platform, Singapore Eye Research Institute"}, "56970564300": {"Name": "Richards C.", "AuthorID": "56970564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56970895100": {"Name": "Smart T.", "AuthorID": "56970895100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55474788000": {"Name": "Jones P.H.", "AuthorID": "55474788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
