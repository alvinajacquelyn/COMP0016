To investigate how ribozymal function is governed by structure and dynamics, we study the full hammerhead ribozyme in bulk water and in an aqueous clay mineral environment by computer simulation using replica-exchange molecular dynamics. Through extensive sampling of the major conformational states of the hammerhead ribozyme, we are able to show that the hammerhead manifests a free-energy landscape reminiscent of that which is well known in proteins, exhibiting a \"funnel\" topology that guides the ribozyme into its globally most stable conformation. The active-site geometry is found to be closely correlated to the tertiary structure of the ribozyme, thereby reconciling conflicts between previously proposed mechanisms for the self-scission of the hammerhead. The conformational analysis also accounts for the differences reported experimentally in the catalytic activity of the hammerhead ribozyme, which is reduced when interacting with clay minerals as compared with bulk water.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conformational analysis", "Conformational state", "Free energy landscape", "Mineral surfaces", "Molecular fossils", "Replica exchange molecular dynamics", "Structure and dynamics", "Tertiary structures", "Aluminum Silicates", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Molecular Structure", "Particle Size", "RNA, Catalytic", "Surface Properties", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924019272", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"37032094100": {"Name": "Swadling J.", "AuthorID": "37032094100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56673346700": {"Name": "Wright D.", "AuthorID": "56673346700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16744711000": {"Name": "Suter J.", "AuthorID": "16744711000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
