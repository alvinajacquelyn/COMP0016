High top-tension keeps its straight configuration and helps to prevent compressive loads. Because of the floater's heave motion, the tension on the riser fluctuates giving rise to dynamic buckling. This paper examines the dynamic buckling characteristics of a top-tensioned riser analyzing the governing equation with nonlinear damping. The equation is discretized in space by the finite difference method and then is numerically integrated by the Runge-Kutta method. As main objective, an ultimate limit state function for risers is used to investigate its reliability during parametric excitation. While the short-term stationary Gaussian random motion of a floater can be described by a response spectrum, the uncertainties of a long-term response are considered by Monte Carlo simulation. In view of an applied example, it is found that the dynamic buckling would occur often, and although the probability of failure is acceptable, it can cause serious failure when axial excitation is of significance in harsher sea states. This study aims to contribute in clarifying the role of parametric vibrations (dynamic buckling) in the reliability of risers for ultimate limit state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Marine riser", "Nonlinear quadratic damping", "Probability of dynamic buckling", "Random heave-induced parametric excitation", "Ultimate limit state reliability analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic buckling", "Governing equations", "Parametric excitations", "Parametric vibrations", "Probability of failure", "Quadratic damping", "Top tensioned risers", "Ultimate limit state"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040798453", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56016440200": {"Name": "Cabrera-Miranda J.M.", "AuthorID": "56016440200", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
