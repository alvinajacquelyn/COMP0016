Current search systems do not provide adequate support for users tackling complex tasks due to which the cognitive burden of keeping track of such tasks is placed on the searcher. In this note, we summarize our recent efforts towards extracting search tasks from search logs. Based on recent advancements in Bayesian Nonparametrics and distributional semantics, we propose novel algorithms to extract task and subtasks from a query collection. The models discussed can inform the design of the next generation of task-based search systems that leverage user\u2019s task behavior for better support and personalization.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian nonparametrics", "Distributional semantics", "Information seeking behaviors", "Novel algorithm", "Personalizations", "Query-log minings", "Search behavior", "Search process"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988569041", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55522733300": {"Name": "Mehrotra R.", "AuthorID": "55522733300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203056765": {"Name": "Yilmaz E.", "AuthorID": "57203056765", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
