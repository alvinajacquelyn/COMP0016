The \u03b413C values are typical of carbonates precipitating in an open lake system with the exception of samples from the very uppermost parts of these sequences which have values more typical of palustrine or tufaceous carbonates and, therefore, indicate the progressive contraction and shrinkage of the lake system overtime. The \u03b418O values record an initial increase to an early peak at the onset of the Holocene but a subsequent decline in values of such a magnitude that by ca 8000 yrs B.P. the \u03b418O value of the precipitated carbonate is consistent with carbonates that precipitated at the end of the Loch Lomond Stadial. The early increase and peak in \u03b418O values is suggested to reflect the climatic amelioration at the onset of the Holocene, as temperatures progressively rose. The decline cannot be explained by any known temperature shifts, however, this \"depletion trend\" is seen in several other early Holocene lacustrine records from across the British Isles. This decline is suggested to reflect a shift in the seasonality of precipitation from a more seasonal precipitation regime typical of a \"continental\" climate, with strong seasonal contrasts in rainfall, to a more \"maritime\" climate which was characterised by consistent levels of rainfall occurring across the year. The relative timing of human activity at Star Carr suggests human occupation occurred after this isotopic decline under \"maritime\" rather than \"continental\" climates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Holocene", "Lacustrine carbonate", "Oxygen and carbon isotopes", "Star Carr"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922796148", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"6602210050": {"Name": "Candy I.", "AuthorID": "6602210050", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "56516821300": {"Name": "Farry A.", "AuthorID": "56516821300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "56037268100": {"Name": "Darvill C.M.", "AuthorID": "56037268100", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Durham University, Science Laboratories"}, "15064760000": {"Name": "Palmer A.", "AuthorID": "15064760000", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "8732868300": {"Name": "Blockley S.P.E.", "AuthorID": "8732868300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "8594656800": {"Name": "Matthews I.P.", "AuthorID": "8594656800", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "35170620600": {"Name": "MacLeod A.", "AuthorID": "35170620600", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "56516984100": {"Name": "Deeprose L.", "AuthorID": "56516984100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "56516549900": {"Name": "Farley N.", "AuthorID": "56516549900", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "56516341200": {"Name": "Kearney R.", "AuthorID": "56516341200", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "6506615781": {"Name": "Conneller C.", "AuthorID": "6506615781", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Archaeology, School of Arts, Languages and Cultures, University of Manchester"}, "49862180300": {"Name": "Taylor B.", "AuthorID": "49862180300", "AffiliationID": "60102026", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Chester"}, "36780881900": {"Name": "Milner N.", "AuthorID": "36780881900", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of York, The Kings Manor"}}}
