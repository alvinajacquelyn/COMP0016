The goal is to choose design variables by optimising two conflicting objectives: (i) maximising neotissue growth and (ii) minimising operating cost. Our contribution is a novel extension of Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to the case of one black-box (neotissue growth) and one analytical (operating cost) objective function, that helps determine, within a reasonable amount of time, what design variables best manage the trade-off between neotissue growth and operating cost. Our method is tested against and outperforms the most common approach in literature, genetic algorithms, and shows its important real-world applicability to problems that combine black-box models with easy-to-quantify objectives like cost.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian optimisation", "black-box optimisation", "bone neotissue engineering", "multi-objective optimisation", "tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041418508", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57199405280": {"Name": "Olofsson S.", "AuthorID": "57199405280", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "24922891000": {"Name": "Deisenroth M.", "AuthorID": "24922891000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "26868073800": {"Name": "Misener R.", "AuthorID": "26868073800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "57200495164": {"Name": "Mehrian M.", "AuthorID": "57200495164", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "55901639500": {"Name": "Geris L.", "AuthorID": "55901639500", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "55418579600": {"Name": "Calandra R.", "AuthorID": "55418579600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of EECS, University of California"}}}
