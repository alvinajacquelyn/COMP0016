While conventional beamforming schemes aim at the minimization of the transmit power subject to suppressing interference to guarantee quality of service (QoS) constraints, here we use the knowledge of both data and channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter to exploit, rather than suppress, constructive interference. More specifically, we design a new precoding scheme for the MISO downlink that minimizes the transmit power for generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated signals. The proposed precoder reduces the transmit power compared to conventional schemes, by adapting the QoS constraints to accommodate constructive interference as a source of useful signal power. By exploiting the power of constructively interfering symbols, the proposed scheme achieves the required QoS at lower transmit power. We extend this concept to the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem, where higher SINR values compared to the conventional SINR balancing optimization are achieved for given transmit power budgets. In addition, we derive equivalent virtual multicast formulations for both optimizations, both of which provide insights of the optimal solution and facilitate the design of a more efficient solver. Finally, we propose a robust beamforming technique to deal with imperfect CSI, that also reduces the transmit power over conventional techniques, while guaranteeing the required QoS. Our simulation and analysis show significant power savings for small scale MISO downlink channels with the proposed data-aided optimization compared to conventional beamforming optimization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constructive interference", "convex optimization", "downlink beamforming", "power minimization", "SINR balancing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Constructive interference", "Conventional beamforming", "Downlink beam-forming", "Multi user multiple input single outputs", "Power minimization", "Quality of Service constraints", "Signal to interference plus noise ratio", "SINR balancing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933545219", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16176882900": {"Name": "Zheng G.", "AuthorID": "16176882900", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"}}}
