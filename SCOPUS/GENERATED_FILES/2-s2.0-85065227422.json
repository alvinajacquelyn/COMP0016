Published by Cambridge University Press.Objective: White matter (WM) microstructural changes are increasingly recognized as a mechanism of age-related cognitive differences. This study examined the associations between patterns of WM microstructure and cognitive performance on the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment (BHA) subtests of memory (Favorites), executive functions and speed (Match), and visuospatial skills (Line Orientation) within a sample of older adults. Method: Fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM tracts and BHA performance were examined in 84 older adults diagnosed as neurologically healthy (47), with mild cognitive impairment (19), or with dementia (18). The relationships between FA and subtest performances were evaluated using regression analyses. We then explored whether regional WM predicted performance after accounting for variance explained by global FA. Results: Memory performance was associated with FA of the fornix and the superior cerebellar peduncle; and executive functions and speed, with the body of the corpus callosum. The fornix-memory association and the corpus callosum-executive association remained significant after accounting for global FA. Neither tract-based nor global FA was associated with visuospatial performance. Conclusions: Memory and executive functions are associated with different patterns of WM diffusivity. Findings add insight into WM alterations underlying age-and disease-related cognitive decline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brief assessment", "Cognition", "Dementia", "Diffusion tensor imaging", "Mild cognitive impairment", "White matter microstructure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cerebral Peduncle", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Corpus Callosum", "Dementia", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Executive Function", "Female", "Fornix, Brain", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Neuropsychological Tests", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065227422", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56534019700": {"Name": "Alioto A.G.", "AuthorID": "56534019700", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease Center-East Bay, University of California"}, "57201194445": {"Name": "Mumford P.", "AuthorID": "57201194445", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57205754619": {"Name": "Wolf A.", "AuthorID": "57205754619", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}, "56135574100": {"Name": "Casaletto K.B.", "AuthorID": "56135574100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}, "57200326049": {"Name": "Erlhoff S.", "AuthorID": "57200326049", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}, "55869490800": {"Name": "Moskowitz T.", "AuthorID": "55869490800", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}, "57219148089": {"Name": "Kramer J.H.", "AuthorID": "57219148089", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}, "7006821977": {"Name": "Rankin K.P.", "AuthorID": "7006821977", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}, "9942578900": {"Name": "Possin K.L.", "AuthorID": "9942578900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California"}}}
