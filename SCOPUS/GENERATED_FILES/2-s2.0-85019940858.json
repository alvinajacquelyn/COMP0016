Ion acceleration in forward direction was measured by SiC detectors and ion collectors used in the time-of-flight configuration. Laser irradiations were employed using p-polarized light at different incidence angles with respect to the target surface and at different focal distances from the target surface. Measurements demonstrate that resonant absorption effects, due to the plasmawave excitations, enhance the plasma temperature and the ion acceleration with respect to those performed without to use of p-polarized light. Dependences of the ion flux characteristics on the laser energy, wavelength, focal distance and incidence angle will be reported and discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic detector readout concepts (solid-state)", "Plasma diagnostics - charged-particle spectroscopy", "Plasma generation (laser-produced, RF, x ray-produced)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charged particle spectroscopy", "Electronic detectors", "Nonequilibrium plasmas", "Plasma generation", "Plasma temperature", "Resonant absorption", "Short-pulsed laser", "Target-normal sheath accelerations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019940858", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"23490532700": {"Name": "Torrisi L.", "AuthorID": "23490532700", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Physics Science Department and MIFT, Messina University"}, "7006456236": {"Name": "Badziak J.", "AuthorID": "7006456236", "AffiliationID": "60073847", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion"}, "57190893907": {"Name": "Rosinski M.", "AuthorID": "57190893907", "AffiliationID": "60073847", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion"}, "56181218400": {"Name": "Zaras-Szydlowska A.", "AuthorID": "56181218400", "AffiliationID": "60073847", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion"}, "7102600404": {"Name": "Pfeifer M.", "AuthorID": "7102600404", "AffiliationID": "60031135", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Institute of Physics, ASCR"}, "56519604100": {"Name": "Torrisi A.", "AuthorID": "56519604100", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}}}
