For this purpose, various numerical tools\u2014for example, the fully nonlinear potential theory (FNPT),the Navier\u2013Stokes (NS) models, and hybrid approaches combining different numerical models\u2014have been developed andemployed. However, there is still great uncertainty over the required level of model fidelity when being applied to a widerange of wave-structure interaction problems. This paper aims to shed some light on this issue with a specific focus on theoverall error sourced from wave generation/absorbing techniques and resolving the viscous and turbulent effects, by comparingthe performances of three different models, including the quasi-arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian finite element method(QALE-FEM) based on the FNPT, an in-house two-phase NS model with large-eddy simulation and a hybrid model couplingthe QALE-FEM with the OpenFOAM/InterDymFoam, in the cases with a fixed FPSO-like structure under extreme focusingwaves. The relative errors of numerical models are defined against the experimental data, which are released after thenumerical works have been completed (i.e., a blind test), in terms of the pressure and wave elevations. This paper providesa practical reference for not only choosing an appropriate model in practices but also on developing/optimizing numericaltools for more reliable and robust predications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blind test", "Comparative study", "FNPT", "LES", "NS models", "Wave-structure interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Appropriate models", "Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian finite element methods", "Blind test", "Comparative studies", "FNPT", "Modeling fidelity", "Turbulent effects", "Wave-structure interaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068921305", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57221381598": {"Name": "Yan S.", "AuthorID": "57221381598", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, City, University of London"}, "57189459696": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "57189459696", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, City, University of London"}, "55850162000": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55850162000", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, City, University of London"}, "7402815725": {"Name": "Ma Q.", "AuthorID": "7402815725", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, City, University of London"}, "16235608000": {"Name": "Xie Z.", "AuthorID": "16235608000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
