Underpinning this is the assumption that the majority of sediment eroded from hinterland orogenic belts is transported to and ultimately stored in marine basins with little lag between erosion and deposition. Here we use a detailed and multi-technique sedimentary provenance dataset from the Yellow River to show that substantial amounts of sediment eroded from Northeast Tibet and carried by the river's upper reach are stored in the Chinese Loess Plateau and the western Mu Us desert. This finding revises our understanding of the origin of the Chinese Loess Plateau and provides a potential solution for mismatches between late Cenozoic terrestrial sedimentation and marine geochemistry records, as well as between global CO 2 and erosion records.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944097627", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8724996900": {"Name": "Nie J.", "AuthorID": "8724996900", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "55496219100": {"Name": "Hu X.", "AuthorID": "55496219100", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "55693776300": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "55693776300", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "55694492300": {"Name": "Peng W.", "AuthorID": "55694492300", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "55694300700": {"Name": "Ji S.", "AuthorID": "55694300700", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "24559562800": {"Name": "Pan B.", "AuthorID": "24559562800", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "14619596900": {"Name": "Stevens T.", "AuthorID": "14619596900", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University"}, "25321162000": {"Name": "Rittner M.", "AuthorID": "25321162000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6507304421": {"Name": "Vermeesch P.", "AuthorID": "6507304421", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6603484808": {"Name": "Stockli D.", "AuthorID": "6603484808", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological sciences, University of Texas"}, "22936682300": {"Name": "Breecker D.", "AuthorID": "22936682300", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological sciences, University of Texas"}, "7003625845": {"Name": "Garzanti E.", "AuthorID": "7003625845", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "55194835200": {"Name": "Limonta M.", "AuthorID": "55194835200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7402861205": {"Name": "And\u00f2 S.", "AuthorID": "7402861205", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "36348470200": {"Name": "Resentini A.", "AuthorID": "36348470200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7006062965": {"Name": "Vezzoli G.", "AuthorID": "7006062965", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "55554942300": {"Name": "Bird A.", "AuthorID": "55554942300", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences, University of Hull"}, "26039374500": {"Name": "Saylor J.", "AuthorID": "26039374500", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric sciences, University of Houston"}, "26643608000": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "26643608000", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Oceanographic and Geographic Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "7402910196": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "7402910196", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
