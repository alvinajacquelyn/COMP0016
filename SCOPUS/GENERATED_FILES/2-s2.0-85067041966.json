Previous reports suggested that variations in HM TGF-\u03b2 levels are associated with allergic outcomes. Objective: We undertook a systematic review (PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017069920) to reassess the evidence on the relationships between HM TGF-\u03b2 and allergic outcomes in children. Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched. Two independent reviewers screened reference lists, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias using the National Institute for Clinical Excellence methodological checklist. Results: A total of 21 studies were identified. Sixteen studies assessed relationships between HM TGF-\u03b2 and risk of eczema; 14, allergic sensitization; nine, wheezing/asthma; six, food allergy; three, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis. Five cohorts (5/18, 28%) reported a protective effect of TGF-\u03b21, while 3 (3/10, 30%) suggested increased risk of allergic outcomes development and 1 (1/10, 10%), a protective effect of TGF-\u03b22 on eczema. Meta-analysis was not possible due to significant heterogeneity in methodology, age of outcome assessment and differing statistical approaches. 71% (15/21) of studies carried a high risk of bias. Conclusion and clinical relevance: In contrast with previous findings, we did not find strong evidence of associations between HM TGF-\u03b2 and allergic outcomes. Differences in studies' methodology and outcomes do not allow unconditional rejection or acceptance of the hypothesis that HM TGF-\u03b2 influences the risk of allergy development. Future studies on diverse populations employing standardized methods, accurate phenotyping of outcomes and evaluation of the effect of TGF-\u03b2 in combination with other HM immune markers, microbiome and oligosaccharides are required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allergic diseases", "allergic sensitization", "allergy", "atopy", "breast milk", "breastfeeding", "colostrum", "human milk", "transforming growth factor beta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Milk Hypersensitivity", "Milk Proteins", "Milk, Human", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Transforming Growth Factor beta2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067041966", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57192963289": {"Name": "Khaleva E.", "AuthorID": "57192963289", "AffiliationID": "119099202", "AffiliationName": "inVIVO Planetary Health, Research Group of the Worldwide Universities Network"}, "6507668540": {"Name": "Gridneva Z.", "AuthorID": "6507668540", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, The University of Western Australia"}, "22940712000": {"Name": "Geddes D.T.", "AuthorID": "22940712000", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, The University of Western Australia"}, "7202685792": {"Name": "Boyle R.J.", "AuthorID": "7202685792", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Evidence-based Dermatology, University of Nottingham"}, "35370613800": {"Name": "Warner J.O.", "AuthorID": "35370613800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Paediatrics and NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for NW London"}, "55233686800": {"Name": "Munblit D.", "AuthorID": "55233686800", "AffiliationID": "60117722", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Department of Moscow, Moscow Research and Clinical Center for Neuropsychiatry"}, "7003852677": {"Name": "Oddy W.H.", "AuthorID": "7003852677", "AffiliationID": "60027621, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology, Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania"}, "56003217500": {"Name": "Colicino S.", "AuthorID": "56003217500", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "The National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "56020531500": {"Name": "Blyuss O.", "AuthorID": "56020531500", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Pediatrics, Sechenov University"}}}
