To build further participation in digital citizen science, it is important to research who participates in digital citizen science, and what motivates them to participate at various levels of engagement. This chapter first presents an overview of different kinds of digital citizen science projects. Then, it describes and discusses human-computer interaction (HCI) research studies that have explored volunteers' motivations and also the impact of gamification. While exploring the breadth of volunteers' motivations, it is important to consider the temporal dynamics of volunteers' motivations and how motivations can change over time. Once scientists understand what motivates different groups of volunteers to participate in digital citizen science, they can work towards improving the design of digital citizen science projects to better fit the requirements of volunteers, thereby maximizing the opportunities for their engagement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Citizen science website designing", "Digital citizen science projects", "Gamification", "Human-computer interaction research studies", "Volunteers' motivation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049711031", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"24366599100": {"Name": "Jennett C.", "AuthorID": "24366599100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre (UCLIC)"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre (UCLIC)"}}}
