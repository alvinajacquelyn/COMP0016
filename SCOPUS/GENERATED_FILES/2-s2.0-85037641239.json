All rights reserved.The majority of Latinos in the United States identify with the Democratic Party, a tendency with broad political implications as Latinos become an increasingly large segment of the population. Little research, however, has delved into the origins of this preference. In this research, we contrast two explanations for Latinos' Democratic proclivities: an instrumental explanation grounded in ideological policy preferences and an expressive identity account based on the defense of Latino identity and status. In analysis of data from two large national datasets, the 2012 Latino Immigrant National Election Study and American National Election Study focused on Latino immigrants and citizens respectively, we find strong support for the expressive identity explanation. Hispanic and partisan identities have converged among Latinos in the United States to create a large number of Latino Democrats regardless of citizenship status. Those who identify strongly as Latinos and see pervasive discrimination against Latinos are the strongest Democrats, a process that further intensified over the course of the 2012 election. A strong partisan preference increased political campaign activity, though this activity level was modest overall. Relatively few Latinos had worked on a campaign or given money to a candidate; somewhat larger numbers had tried to convince others about a candidate or worn a button or displayed a sticker. Finally, some support was evident for an instrumental account. Latino support for government-provided health insurance in 2012 consistently increased support for the Democratic Party.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Latino identity", "Partisanship", "Political participation", "Social identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037641239", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"6603749047": {"Name": "Huddy L.", "AuthorID": "6603749047", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, Stony Brook University, Social and Behavioral Sciences Building, 7th Floor"}, "56533317200": {"Name": "Horwitz S.", "AuthorID": "56533317200", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, Stony Brook University, Social and Behavioral Sciences Building, 7th Floor"}, "55509119500": {"Name": "Mason L.", "AuthorID": "55509119500", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "3140 Tydings Hall, University of Maryland"}}}
