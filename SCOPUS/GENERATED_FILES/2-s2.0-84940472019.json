Published by Taylor & Francis.Education reform is increasingly based on emulating the features of \u2018world-class\u2019 systems that top international attainment surveys and, in England specifically, East Asia is referenced as the \u2018inspiration\u2019 for their education reforms. However, the extent to which the features identified by the UK Government accord with the situation within East Asia is problematic. This paper examines the relationship between the English representation and the \u2018reality\u2019 of East Asian education systems, using school autonomy as an illustrative example. We focus on Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, which are cited extensively to legitimate policies providing greater autonomy for schools in England. We argue firstly that the English representation has been largely discursive and inaccurate; has failed to recognise the variations across the region; and has been selected to endorse the Government\u2019s ideological preferences. Secondly, the scope, form and nature of school autonomy vary markedly, and are operationalised in each society in ways reflecting the prevailing sociopolitical priorities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["East Asia", "England", "policy borrowing/referencing", "school autonomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940472019", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56810290900": {"Name": "You Y.", "AuthorID": "56810290900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institution of Education, University College London"}, "7402150308": {"Name": "Morris P.", "AuthorID": "7402150308", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institution of Education, University College London"}}}
