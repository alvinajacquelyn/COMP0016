The proposed design mitigates the deleterious effects of group delay dispersion and provides wide bandwidth with small ripples and continuously tunable long delays achieved with small variations in the effective refraction index, making it suitable for high-speed optical networks on chip.", "AuthorKeywords": ["All-pass filter (APF)", "Microring resonators", "Network on chip", "Optical delay line", "Optical time division multiplexer (OTDM)"], "IndexKeywords": ["All-pass filters (APF)", "Effective refraction index", "Group delay dispersion", "High speed optical networks", "Microring resonator", "Optical delay lines", "Time division", "Tunable optical delay line"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002940860", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35747150700": {"Name": "Yu Z.", "AuthorID": "35747150700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57199110554": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "57199110554", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Automation, China University of Geosciences"}, "57211368256": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57211368256", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Automation, China University of Geosciences"}, "55571685200": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55571685200", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Automation, China University of Geosciences"}, "6603738758": {"Name": "Selviah D.", "AuthorID": "6603738758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
