In the past 10. years, progress has been made in the early identification of septic patients and in their treatment and these improvements in support and therapy mean that the mortality is gradually decreasing but it still remains unacceptably high. Leaving clinical diagnosis aside, the laboratory diagnostics represent a complex range of investigations that can place significant demands on the system given the speed of response required. There are hundreds of biomarkers which could be potentially used for diagnosis and prognosis in septic patients. The main attributes of successful markers would be high sensitivity, specificity, possibility of bed-side monitoring, and financial accessibility. Only a fraction is used in routine clinical practice because many lack sufficient sensitivity or specificity. The following review gives a short overview of the current epidemiology of sepsis, its pathogenesis and state-of-the-art knowledge on the use of specific biochemical, hematological and immunological parameters in its diagnostics. Prospective approaches towards discovery of new diagnostic biomarkers have been shortly mentioned.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Sensitivity", "Sepsis", "SIRS", "Specificity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute-Phase Proteins", "Antigens, CD14", "Biological Markers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Calcitonin", "Carrier Proteins", "Cytokines", "Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Leukocytes", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Precursors", "Sepsis", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911889684", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"7003776272": {"Name": "Prucha M.", "AuthorID": "7003776272", "AffiliationID": "60010760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hematology and Immunology, Hospital Na Homolce"}, "6701610029": {"Name": "Bellingan G.", "AuthorID": "6701610029", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "23394348200": {"Name": "Zazula R.", "AuthorID": "23394348200", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and Thomayer Hospital"}}}
