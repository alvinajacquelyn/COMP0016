Aim: To understand better the development of the UK speech and language therapy profession over the last 50 years. Methods & Procedures: All volumes of the professional journal of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists published between 1966 and 2015 (British Journal of Communication Disorders, European Journal of Communication Disorders and International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders) were examined using content analysis. The content was compared with that of the same journal as it appeared from 1935 to 1965. Outcomes & Results: The journal has shown a trend towards more multi-authored and international papers, and a formalization of research methodologies. The volume of papers has increased considerably. Topic areas have expanded, but retain many of the areas of study found in earlier issues of the journal. Conclusions & Implications: The journal and its articles reflect the growing complexity of conditions being researched by speech and language therapists and their professional colleagues and give an indication of the developing evidence base for intervention and the diverse routes which speech and language therapy practice has taken over the last 50 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["content analysis", "history", "speech and language therapy (SLT)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Authorship", "Bibliometrics", "Biomedical Research", "Diffusion of Innovation", "Forecasting", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Information Dissemination", "International Cooperation", "Language Therapy", "Periodicals as Topic", "Speech Therapy", "Speech-Language Pathology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018640815", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7101900516": {"Name": "Armstrong L.", "AuthorID": "7101900516", "AffiliationID": "115614614", "AffiliationName": "Dunfermline"}, "6603812756": {"Name": "Stansfield J.", "AuthorID": "6603812756", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "15030938100": {"Name": "Bloch S.", "AuthorID": "15030938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
