However, there is limited evidence on the prospective association of activity levels with injuries resulting in use of hospital services. We examined the relationship between objectively-measured physical activity (PA) and subsequent injuries resulting in hospital admissions or accident and emergency department (A&E) attendances, using linked electronic hospital records (EHR) from a nationally representative prospective cohort of CYP in Wales and Scotland. Methods We analysed accelerometer-based estimates of moderate to vigorous (MVPA) and vigorous PA (VPA) from 1,585 (777 [46%] boys) seven-year-old Millennium Cohort Study members, living in Wales or Scotland, whose parents consented to linkage of cohort records to EHRs up until their 14th birthday. Negative binomial regression models adjusted by potential individual, household and area-level confounders, were fitted to estimate associations between average daily minutes of MVPA, and VPA (in 10-minute increments), and number of injury-related hospital admissions and/or A&E attendances from age nine to 14 years. Results CYP spent a median of 59.5 and 18.1 minutes in MVPA and VPA/day respectively, with boys significantly more active than girls; 47.3% of children experienced at least one injury-related admission or A&E attendance during the study period. Rates of injury-related hospital admission and/or A&E attendance were positively associated with MVPA and VPA in boys but not in girls: respective adjusted incidence rate ratios (95% CI) for boys: 1.09 (1.01, 1.17) and 1.16 (1.00, 1.34), and for girls: 0.94 (0.86, 1.03) and 0.85 (0.69, 1.04). Conclusion Boys but not girls who engage in more intense PA at age seven years are at higher risk of injury-related hospital admission or A&E attendance when aged nine to 14 years than their less active peers. This may reflect gender differences in the type and associated risks of activities undertaken. EHRs can make a useful contribution to injury surveillance and prevention if routinely augmented with information on context and setting of the injuries sustained. Injury prevention initiatives should not discourage engagement in PA and outdoor play given their over-riding health and social benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Adolescent", "Child", "Exercise", "Female", "Hospital Records", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Scotland", "Sex Characteristics", "Wales", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064150243", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"10139414100": {"Name": "Griffiths L.J.", "AuthorID": "10139414100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "35797996000": {"Name": "Akbari A.", "AuthorID": "35797996000", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Administrative Data Research Centre Wales, Swansea University Medical School"}, "55259733900": {"Name": "Lyons R.A.", "AuthorID": "55259733900", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Population Health and Wellbeing Research, Swansea University Medical School"}, "7004859466": {"Name": "Bedford H.", "AuthorID": "7004859466", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "54952739400": {"Name": "Dezateux C.", "AuthorID": "54952739400", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK London, Queen Mary University London"}, "26643625100": {"Name": "Cortina-Borja M.", "AuthorID": "26643625100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology, Nutrition and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55665447800": {"Name": "DeStavola B.L.", "AuthorID": "55665447800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology, Nutrition and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56659379500": {"Name": "Tingay K.", "AuthorID": "56659379500", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Administrative Data Research Centre Wales, Swansea University Medical School"}, "56428539800": {"Name": "Bandyopadhyay A.", "AuthorID": "56428539800", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Population Health and Wellbeing Research, Swansea University Medical School"}}}
