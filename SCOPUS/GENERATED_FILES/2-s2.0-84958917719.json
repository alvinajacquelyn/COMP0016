Hydrocephalus can be succinctly described as the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain which ultimately leads to oedema within specific sites of parenchymal tissue. Using hydrocephalus as a test bed, one is able to account for the necessary mechanisms involved in the interaction between oedema formation and cerebral fluid production, transport and drainage. The current state of knowledge about integrative cerebral dynamics and transport phenomena indicates that poroelastic theory may provide a suitable framework to better understand various diseases. In this work, Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory (MPET) is used to develop a novel spatio-temporal model of fluid regulation and tissue displacement within the various scales of the cerebral environment. The model is applied through two formats, a one-dimensional finite difference - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupling framework, as well as a two-dimensional Finite Element Method (FEM) formulation. These are used to investigate the role of endoscopic fourth ventriculostomy in alleviating oedema formation due to fourth ventricle outlet obstruction (1D coupled model) in addition to observing the capability of the FEM template in capturing important characteristics allied to oedema formation, like for instance in the periventricular region (2D model).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aquaporins", "Cerebral oedema", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Endoscopic ventriculostomy", "Finite Element Method", "Fourth Ventricular Outlet Obstruction", "Gliosis", "Hydrocephalus", "Intracranial Pressure", "Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory", "Periventricular lucency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aquaporins", "Cerebral oedema", "Fourth Ventricular Outlet Obstruction", "Gliosis", "Hydrocephalus", "Intra-cranial pressure", "Periventricular lucency", "Poroelastic theory", "Ventriculostomy", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Brain Edema", "Elasticity", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Porosity", "Ventriculostomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958917719", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56039685400": {"Name": "Vardakis J.", "AuthorID": "56039685400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56999958600": {"Name": "Chou D.", "AuthorID": "56999958600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "27667929500": {"Name": "Tully B.", "AuthorID": "27667929500", "AffiliationID": "60113431", "AffiliationName": "First Light Fusion Ltd."}, "57022822200": {"Name": "Hung C.", "AuthorID": "57022822200", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, Chang Gung University"}, "57205774950": {"Name": "Lee T.", "AuthorID": "57205774950", "AffiliationID": "60031913", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Center and Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center and College of Medicine"}, "7005402627": {"Name": "Tsui P.", "AuthorID": "7005402627", "AffiliationID": "60031913, 60020351", "AffiliationName": "Medical Imaging Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"}}}
