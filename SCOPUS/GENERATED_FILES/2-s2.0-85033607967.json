A fully connected vehicle environment can substantially reduce the latency in response caused by human perception-reaction time with the prospect of improving both safety and comfort. This study presents a dynamical model of route choice under a connected vehicle environment. We analyze the stability of headways by perturbing various factors in the microscopic traffic flow model and traffic flow dynamics in the car-following model and dynamical model of route choice. The advantage of this approach is that it complements the macroscopic traffic assignment model of route choice with microscopic elements that represent the important features of connected vehicles. The gaps between cars can be decreased and stabilized even in the presence of perturbations caused by incidents. The reduction in gaps will be helpful to optimize the traffic flow dynamics more easily with safe and stable conditions. The results show that the dynamics under the connected vehicle environment have equilibria. The approach presented in this study will be helpful to identify the important properties of a connected vehicle environment and to evaluate its benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Connected vehicle", "Dynamical model", "Lyapunov stability", "Route choice", "String stability", "V2X"], "IndexKeywords": ["Connected vehicles", "Dynamical model", "Lyapunov stability", "Route choice", "String stability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033607967", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57209988987": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57209988987", "AffiliationID": "60027652", "AffiliationName": "University of Seoul, Room 523, 21st hall, University of Seoul"}, "6701695159": {"Name": "Heydecker B.", "AuthorID": "6701695159", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Transport Studies"}, "57205753317": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "57205753317", "AffiliationID": "60027652", "AffiliationName": "University of Seoul, Room 533, 21st hall, University of Seoul"}, "57193991395": {"Name": "Park S.", "AuthorID": "57193991395", "AffiliationID": "108198915", "AffiliationName": "The Seoul Institute"}}}
