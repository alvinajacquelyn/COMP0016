Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.During DNA replication many factors can result in DNA replication stress. The DNA replication stress checkpoint prevents the accumulation of replication stress-induced DNA damage and the potential ensuing genome instability. A critical role for post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, in the replication stress checkpoint response has been well established. However, recent work has revealed an important role for transcription in the cellular response to DNA replication stress. In this review, we will provide an overview of current knowledge of the cellular response to DNA replication stress with a specific focus on the DNA replication stress checkpoint transcriptional response and its role in the prevention of replication stress-induced DNA damage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Checkpoint response", "Chk1", "DNA replication", "DNA replication stress", "E2F-dependent transcription", "E2F6", "Oncogene-induced replication stress"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014703115", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56490292300": {"Name": "Herlihy A.", "AuthorID": "56490292300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7006222988": {"Name": "de Bruin R.", "AuthorID": "7006222988", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
