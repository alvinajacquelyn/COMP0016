Typically, this has been understood as citizens and patients having a greater voice and role within the standard research enterprise. Beyond this, however, it is important that the renegotiated contract specifically addresses the oversight of a new, path-breaking approach to health research: participant-led research. In light of the momentum behind participant-led research and its potential to advance health knowledge by challenging and complementing traditional research, it is vital for all stakeholders to work together in securing the conditions that will enable it to flourish.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ethics, Research", "Human Experimentation", "Humans", "Public Policy", "Research Subjects", "Social Responsibility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929593597", "SubjectAreas": [["Issues, Ethics and Legal Aspects", "NURS", "2910"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"6507718293": {"Name": "Vayena E.", "AuthorID": "6507718293", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Ethics, University of Zurich"}, "8262815900": {"Name": "Brownsword R.", "AuthorID": "8262815900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College London"}, "57221007660": {"Name": "Edwards S.J.", "AuthorID": "57221007660", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bioethics and RandD, UCL and UCLH"}, "55758977900": {"Name": "Greshake B.", "AuthorID": "55758977900", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Department for Applied Bioinformatics, Institute for Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Goethe University"}, "7402544167": {"Name": "Kahn J.P.", "AuthorID": "7402544167", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins University"}, "55982478500": {"Name": "Ladher N.", "AuthorID": "55982478500", "AffiliationID": "60025973", "AffiliationName": "BMJ"}, "7402007177": {"Name": "Montgomery J.", "AuthorID": "7402007177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Laws, University College London"}, "35176329400": {"Name": "O'Connor D.", "AuthorID": "35176329400", "AffiliationID": "60022106", "AffiliationName": "Humanities and Social Sciences, Wellcome Trust"}, "7003475713": {"Name": "O'Neill O.", "AuthorID": "7003475713", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, Cambridge University"}, "57203238082": {"Name": "Richards M.P.", "AuthorID": "57203238082", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "25936631000": {"Name": "Rid A.", "AuthorID": "25936631000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Health and Medicine, King's College London"}, "16302464400": {"Name": "Sheehan M.", "AuthorID": "16302464400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, The Ethox Centre"}, "8285266300": {"Name": "Wicks P.", "AuthorID": "8285266300", "AffiliationID": "114081284", "AffiliationName": "PatientsLikeMe"}, "26033524500": {"Name": "Tasioulas J.", "AuthorID": "26033524500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy and Law, Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College London"}}}
