MacroH2A1, a variant of histone H2A, emerged as a key chromatin regulator sensing small nutrients during cell proliferation and differentiation. Mice genetically ablated for macroH2A1 (knockout (KO)) do not show overt phenotypes under a standard diet. Our objective was to analyse the in vivo role of macroH2A1 in response to nutritional excess. METHODS: Twelve-week-old whole-body macroH2A1 KO male mice were given a high-fat diet (60% energy from lard) for 12 weeks until being killed, and examined for glucose and insulin tolerance, and for body fat composition. Energy expenditure was assessed using metabolic cages and by measuring the expression levels of genes involved in thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) or in adipogenesis in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). RESULTS: Under a chow diet, macroH2A1 KO mice did not differ from their wild-type (WT) littermates for body weight, and for sensitivity to glucose or insulin. However, KO mice displayed decreased heat production (P < 0.05), and enhanced total activity during the night (P < 0.01). These activities related to protection against diet-induced obesity in KO mice, which displayed decreased body weight owing to a specific decrease in fat mass (P < 0.05), increased tolerance to glucose (P < 0.05), and enhanced total activity during the day (P < 0.05), compared with WT mice. KO mice displayed increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ucp1, P < 0.05; Glut4, P < 0.05; Cox4, P < 0.01) in BAT and a decreased expression of adipogenic genes (Ppar\u03b3, P < 0.05; Fabp4, P < 0.05; Glut4, P < 0.05) in VAT compared with WT mice, indicative of augmented energy expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic eviction of macroH2A1 confers protection against diet-induced obesity and metabolic derangements in mice. Inhibition of macroH2A1 might be a helpful strategy for epigenetic therapy of obesity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adipogenesis", "Adipose Tissue, Brown", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Diet, High-Fat", "Disease Models, Animal", "Energy Metabolism", "Histones", "Insulin Resistance", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Thinness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922602632", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55807731900": {"Name": "Sheedfar F.", "AuthorID": "55807731900", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section Molecular Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)"}, "56201744800": {"Name": "Vermeer M.", "AuthorID": "56201744800", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section Molecular Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)"}, "56521771700": {"Name": "Van Der Molen H.", "AuthorID": "56521771700", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section Molecular Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)"}, "57211875242": {"Name": "Hofker M.H.", "AuthorID": "57211875242", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section Molecular Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)"}, "6506589091": {"Name": "Koonen D.P.", "AuthorID": "6506589091", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section Molecular Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)"}, "12795672600": {"Name": "Pazienza V.", "AuthorID": "12795672600", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS 'Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza' Hospital"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "57205685014": {"Name": "Villarroya J.", "AuthorID": "57205685014", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBER Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad Y Nutricion, Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "7007150708": {"Name": "Villarroya F.", "AuthorID": "7007150708", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB), University of Barcelona"}, "56007949600": {"Name": "Rappa F.", "AuthorID": "56007949600", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Biomedicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Palermo"}, "7005573063": {"Name": "Cappello F.", "AuthorID": "7005573063", "AffiliationID": "113460019", "AffiliationName": "Euro-Mediterranean Institute of Science and Technology (IEMEST)"}, "6603848797": {"Name": "Mazzoccoli G.", "AuthorID": "6603848797", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Division of Internal Medicine and Chronobiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS 'Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza' Hospital"}}}
