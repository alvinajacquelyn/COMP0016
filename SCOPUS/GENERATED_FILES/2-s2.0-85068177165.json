In large cross-sectional studies, individuals with higher patient activation are observed to have better health outcomes with the assumption that they are more engaged in health self-management. However, the association between patient activation and objectively measured self-care indicators in individuals can be inconsistent. This research investigated the role of patient activation as measured by the UK Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) in adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The aims were twofold: to explore how adults with CF interpret and respond to the PAM-13; and to investigate the association between PAM-13 and objectively measured nebuliser adherence in UK adults with CF. Methods: This article describes two studies which examined the PAM-13 from different perspectives. Study 1 comprised 'think aloud' interviews with 15 adults with CF. The data were analysed using an a priori coding framework. Study 2 examined the association between PAM-13 and objectively measured nebuliser adherence in 57 adults with CF. Results: Study 1 showed that adults with CF encountered several difficulties while completing the PAM-13. The difficulties were related to understanding how to interpret aspects of CF in order to respond (i.e., control over the condition, ability to exercise) and item wording. Some adults with CF responded to the PAM-13 in an optimistic way in relation to what they thought they should do rather than what they actually do. These findings were echoed by the results of Study 2, which showed that PAM-13 scores were not significantly correlated with objective medication adherence in a different sample. This article synthesises the results of both studies, providing insights into influences and associations of patient activation as measured by the UK PAM-13 in adults with CF. Conclusions: There were some significant difficulties created by the wording of the UK PAM-13 for adults with CF. This may partly explain the finding that PAM-13 scores were not related to objectively measured nebuliser adherence in this study. The UK PAM-13 would benefit from further research to verify its validity and reliability in different patient populations against objective measures of behaviour rather than simply self-report.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cystic fibrosis", "Objective medication adherence", "PAM-13", "Patient activation", "Think-aloud"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Nebulizers and Vaporizers", "Qualitative Research", "Self Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068177165", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57201671847": {"Name": "Gao J.", "AuthorID": "57201671847", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Science and Applied Psychology, Sheffield Hallam University"}, "7003677812": {"Name": "Arden M.", "AuthorID": "7003677812", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Science and Applied Psychology, Sheffield Hallam University"}, "40761477000": {"Name": "Hoo Z.H.", "AuthorID": "40761477000", "AffiliationID": "60018477", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Northern General Hospital"}, "7004277323": {"Name": "Wildman M.", "AuthorID": "7004277323", "AffiliationID": "60018477", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Northern General Hospital"}}}
