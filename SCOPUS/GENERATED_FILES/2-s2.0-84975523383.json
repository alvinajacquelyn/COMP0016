LMSs (Learning Management Systems) include such collaborative tools to enable knowledge sharing. Common topology and design constructs of online collaboration are often expressed as forum threads; however, forums or bulletin boards are not primarily designed for social constructivist learning, in which knowledge develops collaboratively in a methodical process that links new items to existing ones. In this paper, we present a preliminary concept and hypothesize that social constructivist learning can be implemented through a semantic network topology of a discussion platform. To that end, we developed Ligilo, a peer-learning, online platform, in which each content item is conveyed as a node in a semantic network constructed of posts. Analysis of this platform consists of three parts. First, we review the theoretical background of networked-structured discussions in learning. Then, we describe the architecture of Ligilo, focusing on two aspects: (1) the learning experience as a process of contributing new information items by relating to existing items and (2) a deep, behavioral analytics framework as a teacher's guide. Both these aspects are based on semantic network topology. We conclude the paper by describing some early cases of peer learning involving networked-structured discussions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Collaborative construction", "Collaborative tools", "Constructivist learning", "Learning community", "Learning experiences", "Learning management system", "On-line collaborations", "Online discussions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975523383", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"6602722788": {"Name": "Rafaeli S.", "AuthorID": "6602722788", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "University of Haifa"}, "35782011800": {"Name": "Kent C.", "AuthorID": "35782011800", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "University of Haifa"}}}
