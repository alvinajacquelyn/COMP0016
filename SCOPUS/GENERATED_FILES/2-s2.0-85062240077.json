This paper aims to construct a high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral (HHS) image from a high-spatial-resolution RGB image, by proposing a novel class-based spectral super-resolution method. With the help of a set of RGB and HHS image-pairs, our proposed method learns nonlinear spectral mappings between RGB and HHS image-pairs using class-based back propagation neural networks (BPNNs). In the training stage, unsupervised clustering is used to divide an RGB image into several classes according to spectral correlation, and the spectrum-pairs from the classified RGB images and the corresponding HHS images are used to train the BPNNs, to establish the nonlinear spectral mapping for each class. In the spectral super-resolution stage, a supervised classification is used to classify the given RGB image into the classes determined during the training stage, and the final HHS image is reconstructed from the classified given RGB image using the trained BPNNs. Comparisons on three standard datasets, ICVL, CAVE and NUS, demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves a better spectral super-resolution quality than related state-of-the-art methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BP neural network", "spectral classification", "spectral mapping", "spectral super-resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Back propagation neural networks", "BP neural networks", "High spectral resolution", "Spectral classification", "Spectral mappings", "State-of-the-art methods", "Super resolution", "Supervised classification"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062240077", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57201580646": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "57201580646", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60073474", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univ"}, "55726588900": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55726588900", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60073474", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univ"}, "56156076900": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "56156076900", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Univ. of Technology"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
