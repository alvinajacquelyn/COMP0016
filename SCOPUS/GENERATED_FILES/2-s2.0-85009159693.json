Anaesthesia published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and IrelandDespite current recommendations on the management of pre-operative anaemia, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in an expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the peri-operative period. These statements include: a diagnostic approach for anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients; identification of patients appropriate for treatment; and advice on practical management and follow-up. We urge anaesthetists and peri-operative physicians to embrace these recommendations, and hospital administrators to enable implementation of these concepts by allocating adequate resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anaemia", "iron", "pre-operative assessment", "transfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anemia", "Consensus", "Health Care Costs", "Humans", "Injections, Intravenous", "Iron", "Perioperative Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009159693", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"56231641300": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz M.", "AuthorID": "56231641300", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Peri-operative Transfusion Medicine, School of Medicine, University of M\u00e1laga"}, "7004957171": {"Name": "Acheson A.G.", "AuthorID": "7004957171", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60099153, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "7006147122": {"Name": "Auerbach M.", "AuthorID": "7006147122", "AffiliationID": "60002396", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Georgetown University"}, "23388172700": {"Name": "Besser M.", "AuthorID": "23388172700", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005872199": {"Name": "Habler O.", "AuthorID": "7005872199", "AffiliationID": "60010405", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Anaesthesiology, Surgical Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Management, Krankenhaus Nordwest"}, "36037127700": {"Name": "Kehlet H.", "AuthorID": "36037127700", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Section of Surgical Pathophysiology, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "15846034000": {"Name": "Liumbruno G.M.", "AuthorID": "15846034000", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Italian National Blood Centre, National Institute of Health"}, "22135124000": {"Name": "Lasocki S.", "AuthorID": "22135124000", "AffiliationID": "60012772, 60009445", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement Anesth\u00e9sie R\u00e9animation, CHU Angers, LUNAM Universit\u00e9 d'Angers"}, "15023032800": {"Name": "Meybohm P.", "AuthorID": "15023032800", "AffiliationID": "60009308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt"}, "56668719400": {"Name": "Rao Baikady R.", "AuthorID": "56668719400", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56427569500": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "56427569500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "35555029800": {"Name": "Shander A.", "AuthorID": "35555029800", "AffiliationID": "60028360", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesiology, Critical Care and Hyperbaric Medicine, Englewood Hospital and Medical Centre TeamHealth Research Institute"}, "14631312900": {"Name": "So-Osman C.", "AuthorID": "14631312900", "AffiliationID": "60021460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transfusion Medicine, Sanquin Blood Bank Amsterdam, and Department of Internal Medicine, Groene Hart Hospital"}, "35464360100": {"Name": "Spahn D.R.", "AuthorID": "35464360100", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Operating Room Management, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "23488940500": {"Name": "Klein A.A.", "AuthorID": "23488940500", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Papworth Hospital"}}}
