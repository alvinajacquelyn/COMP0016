All rights reserved.This paper proposes a novel Plug-and-Play (PnP) dynamic approach for the monitoring of Large-Scale Systems (LSSs). The proposed architecture exploits a distributed Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) methodology for nonlinear LSS in a PnP framework. The LSS consists of several interconnected subsystems and the designed FDI architecture is able to manage plugging-in of novel subsystems and un-plugging of existing ones. Moreover, the proposed PnP approach performs the unplugging of faulty subsystems in order to avoid the propagation of faults in the interconnected LSS. Analogously, once the issue has been solved, the disconnected subsystem can be re-plugged-in. The reconfiguration processes only involves local operations of neighboring subsystems, thus allowing a distributed architecture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distributed", "Fault detection", "Fault isolation", "Large-scale systems", "Monitoring", "Networked systems", "Plug-and-play"], "IndexKeywords": ["Distributed", "Distributed architecture", "Distributed fault detections", "Fault isolation", "Interconnected subsystems", "Networked systems", "Plug and play", "Reconfiguration process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992523474", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"54411982800": {"Name": "Boem F.", "AuthorID": "54411982800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "University of Trieste"}, "55356548000": {"Name": "Riverso S.", "AuthorID": "55356548000", "AffiliationID": "60120577", "AffiliationName": "United, Technologies Research Center Ireland, Penrose Business Center"}, "6603923286": {"Name": "Ferrari-Trecate G.", "AuthorID": "6603923286", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Dip. di Ingegneria Industriale e dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0, degli Studi di Pavia"}}}
