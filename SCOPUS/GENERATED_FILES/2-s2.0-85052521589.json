This includes men who have been diagnosed with lower-risk prostate cancer and are looking at the option of active surveillance (AS). The purpose of this paper is to review the recent evidence supporting the use of mpMRI at different time points in AS, as well as to discuss some of its potential pitfalls. Methods: A combination of electronic and manual searching methods were used to identify recent, important papers investigating the role of mpMRI in AS. Results: The high negative predictive value of mpMRI can be exploited for the selection of AS candidates. In addition, mpMRI can be efficiently used to detect higher risk disease in patients already on surveillance. Conclusion: Although there is an ongoing debate regarding the precise nature of its optimal implementation, mpMRI is a promising risk stratification tool and should be considered for men on AS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Biopsy", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prostatectomy", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Watchful Waiting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052521589", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"43761516900": {"Name": "Stavrinides V.", "AuthorID": "43761516900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
