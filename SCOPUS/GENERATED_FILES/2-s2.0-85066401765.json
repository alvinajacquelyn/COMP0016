All rights reserved.Diabetes and depression are considered global epidemics. Both have multifactorial aetiologies, including external, environmental factors and internal factors in connection with physiological processes as well as genetic variants triggering disease onset. Although the co-occurrence of diabetes and depression is well described, the mechanisms underlying these diseases and their interactions are still not entirely revealed. The authors aimed to present known and potential explanations of the co-occurrence of these diseases and to highlight the importance of their timely diagnosis and effective treatment, as their co-occurrence may increase morbidity and mortality. Screening for depression among diabetes patients and for diabetes among patients with depression may decrease the incidence of complications and consequences of this comorbidity and may foster more effective treatment. General practitioners play a key role in the care of both diseases by providing timely diagnosis and adequate treatment potentially leading to a better quality of life, slower disease progression and decreased risk of complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Depression", "Type 2 diabetes mellitus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Depression", "Diabetes Complications", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Humans", "Hungary", "Mass Screening", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066401765", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57191076558": {"Name": "Csenge H.", "AuthorID": "57191076558", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis Egyetem, \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Orvostudom\u00e1nyi Kar, Csal\u00e1dorvosi Tansz\u00e9k"}, "57194640526": {"Name": "Bernadett M.", "AuthorID": "57194640526", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis Egyetem, \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Orvostudom\u00e1nyi Kar, Csal\u00e1dorvosi Tansz\u00e9k"}, "57209295332": {"Name": "Kriszti\u00e1n V.", "AuthorID": "57209295332", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis Egyetem, \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Orvostudom\u00e1nyi Kar, Csal\u00e1dorvosi Tansz\u00e9k"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "\u00c1d\u00e1m T.G.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis Egyetem, \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Orvostudom\u00e1nyi Kar, I.
