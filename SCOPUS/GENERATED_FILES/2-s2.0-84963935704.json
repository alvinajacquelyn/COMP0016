Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.Polydipsia and polyuria are common symptoms in patients with diabetes insipidus (DI), which can be due to inadequate vasopressin production (cranial DI) or vasopressin insensitivity (nephrogenic DI). Clinical diagnosis of the subtypes of DI can be tricky. We present a 44-year-old man with a strong family history of DI who had been diagnosed with autosomal dominant nephrogenic DI from infancy. At the age of 40, he had progressed to end-stage renal failure. When he experienced unresolving severe polyuria after renal transplant, further investigations revealed that he was misdiagnosed and that he had a novel mutation causing autosomal dominant cranial DI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic renal failure", "congenital cranial diabetes insipidus", "genetic testing", "hereditary polyuric states", "kidney transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963935704", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57188869147": {"Name": "Wong T.", "AuthorID": "57188869147", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, UCL"}, "8925800300": {"Name": "Laing C.", "AuthorID": "8925800300", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6602264965": {"Name": "Ekong R.", "AuthorID": "6602264965", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, UCL"}, "7102845053": {"Name": "Povey S.", "AuthorID": "7102845053", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, UCL"}, "8234615900": {"Name": "Unwin R.J.", "AuthorID": "8234615900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
