Africa represents an ideal venue in which to do this, given its suitable agro-climatic conditions and extensive land area. Brazil has consequently sought to establish bilateral partnerships with African countries, as well as North-South-South trilateral partnerships involving the EU and US. However, empirically grounded assessments of how Brazil\u2019s leadership aspirations have unfolded in practice through these partnerships are limited. In this article, we examine Brazil\u2019s potential to exert global political leadership, by analyzing its policybased, structural, and instrumental qualities in making bilateral and trilateral inroads regarding bioethanol production in Africa. Interviews in Brazil, Africa, and Europe suggest that both the bilateral and trilateral avenues have produced meager results. Lack of domestic strategy and vision, economic recession, and a fragmented alliance network have reduced Brazil\u2019s capacity to achieve its ethanol diplomacy objectives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983373837", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"28767472300": {"Name": "Afionis S.", "AuthorID": "28767472300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds"}, "14018839600": {"Name": "Stringer L.C.", "AuthorID": "14018839600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "55904128500": {"Name": "Favretto N.", "AuthorID": "55904128500", "AffiliationID": "117223251", "AffiliationName": "United Nations University\u2019s Institute for Water, Environment and Health"}, "26636031400": {"Name": "Tomei J.", "AuthorID": "26636031400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, UCL Institute of Sustainable Resources"}, "6701624952": {"Name": "Buckeridge M.S.", "AuthorID": "6701624952", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Botany, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Instituto Nacional de Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia do Bioetanol"}}}
