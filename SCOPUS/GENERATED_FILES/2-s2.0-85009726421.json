One in five cases of TB present as extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), posing major diagnostic and management challenges. Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts to a quiescent physiological state and is notable for its complex interaction with the host, producing poorly understood disease states ranging from latent infection to active clinical disease. New tools in the diagnostic armamentarium are urgently required for the rapid diagnosis of TB and monitoring of TB treatments, and to gain new insights into pathogenesis. The typical and atypical imaging features of EPTB are reviewed herein, and the roles of several imaging modalities for the diagnosis and management of EPTB are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET\u2013CT", "Biomarker", "CT", "Extrapulmonary tuberculosis", "Imaging", "MRI", "PET\u2013CT", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Public Health", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009726421", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7101904356": {"Name": "Gambhir S.", "AuthorID": "7101904356", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "55789980800": {"Name": "Ravina M.", "AuthorID": "55789980800", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "57192986403": {"Name": "Rangan K.", "AuthorID": "57192986403", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "57220479216": {"Name": "Dixit M.", "AuthorID": "57220479216", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "7004286118": {"Name": "Barai S.", "AuthorID": "7004286118", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, of Nuclear Medicine, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
