The gene sortilin 1 (SORT1) has previously been associated with cardiovascular disease in gene association studies. It has also been proposed to be involved in AD pathogenesis through facilitating A\u03b2 clearance by binding apoE/A\u03b2 complexes prior to cellular uptake. However, the neuropathological role of SORT1 in AD is not fully understood. To evaluate the associations between gene variants of SORT1 and risk of AD, we performed genetic analyses in a Swedish case-control cohort. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), covering the whole SORT1 gene, were selected and genotyped in 620 AD patients and 1107 controls. The SNP rs17646665, located in a non-coding region of the SORT1 gene, remained significantly associated with decreased risk of AD after multiple testing (pc=0.0061). In addition, other SNPs were found to be nominally associated with risk of AD, as well as altered cognitive function and the CSF biomarker A\u03b242, but these associations did not survive correction for multiple testing. The fact that SORT1 has been strongly associated with risk of cardiovascular disease is intriguing as cardiovascular disease is also regarded as a risk factor for AD. Finally, increased knowledge about SORT1 function has a potential to increase our understanding of APOE, the strongest risk factor for AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Case-Control Studies", "Disease Resistance", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Peptide Fragments", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk", "Sweden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981713498", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55882225500": {"Name": "Andersson C.H.", "AuthorID": "55882225500", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005834411": {"Name": "Skoog I.", "AuthorID": "7005834411", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7102337222": {"Name": "Wallin A.", "AuthorID": "7102337222", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7006399137": {"Name": "Kettunen P.", "AuthorID": "7006399137", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7003614157": {"Name": "Minthon L.", "AuthorID": "7003614157", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7102011511": {"Name": "Andreasen N.", "AuthorID": "7102011511", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Center for Alzheimer Research, Division of Neurogeriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "35479725000": {"Name": "Nilsson S.", "AuthorID": "35479725000", "AffiliationID": "60000990, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg"}}}
