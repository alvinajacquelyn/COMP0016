We review the literature on HIV shared care to determine current practice and clinical, economic and patient satisfaction outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, NICE Evidence, Cochrane collaboration, Google and websites of the British HIV Association, Aidsmap, Public Health England, World Health Organization and Terrence Higgins Trust using relevant search terms in August 2014. Studies published after 2000, from healthcare settings comparable to the UK that described links between primary care and specialised HIV services were included and compared using principles of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance frameworks. Three of the nine included models reported clinical or patient satisfaction outcomes but data collection and analyses were inadequate. None reported economic outcomes although some provided financial costings. Facilitators of shared care included robust clinical protocols, training and timely communication. Few published examples of HIV shared care exist and quality of evidence is poor. There is no consistent association with improved clinical outcomes, cost effectiveness or acceptability. Models are context specific, driven by local need, although some generalisable features could inform novel service delivery. Further evaluative research is needed to determine optimal components of shared HIV care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "antiretroviral therapy", "high-income countries", "HIV", "HIV management", "primary care", "Shared care", "specialist care", "systematic review", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cooperative Behavior", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Developed Countries", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Patient Care Team", "Patient Outcome Assessment", "Patient Satisfaction", "Primary Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946565516", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56373329800": {"Name": "Mapp F.", "AuthorID": "56373329800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Social & Environmental Health Research"}, "7402097885": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.", "AuthorID": "7402097885", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Blizard Institute"}, "57205874518": {"Name": "Estcourt C.", "AuthorID": "57205874518", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Blizard Institute"}}}
