We show that a withdrawal-like effect also occurs during the late diestrus phase (LD) of the natural ovarian cycle in rats, when plasma progesterone and ALLO are declining but estrogen secretion maintains a stable low level. This effect at LD was prevented by short-term treatment with low dose fluoxetine.During LD, but not at other stages of the estrous cycle, exposure to anxiogenic stress induced by whole body vibration at 4Hz for 5min evoked a significant decrease in tail flick latency (stress-induced hyperalgesia) and a decrease in the number of Fos-positive neurons present in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). The threshold to evoke fear-like behaviors in response to electrical stimulation of the dorsal PAG was lower in the LD phase, indicating an increase in the intrinsic excitability of the PAG circuitry. All these effects were blocked by short-term administration of fluoxetine (2\u00d71.75mgkg-1 i.p.) during LD. This dosage increased the whole brain concentration of ALLO, as determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, but was without effect on the extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the dorsal PAG, as measured by microdialysis.We suggest that fluoxetine-induced rise in brain ALLO concentration during LD offsets the sharp physiological decline, thus removing the trigger for the development of anxiogenic withdrawal effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allopregnanolone", "Anxiety", "C-fos", "Estrous cycle", "Fluoxetine", "Periaqueductal grey matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation", "Arabidopsis Proteins", "Brain", "Brain Chemistry", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Electric Stimulation", "Escape Reaction", "Estrous Cycle", "Female", "Fluoxetine", "Freezing Reaction, Cataleptic", "Hyperalgesia", "Nuclear Proteins", "Periaqueductal Gray", "Pregnanolone", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Serotonin", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920568381", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"12782624500": {"Name": "Devall A.J.", "AuthorID": "12782624500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "7402389053": {"Name": "Santos J.M.", "AuthorID": "7402389053", "AffiliationID": "114875604", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neuroci\u00eancias e Comportamento-INeC"}, "7006508014": {"Name": "Lovick T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006508014", "AffiliationID": "114875604", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neuroci\u00eancias e Comportamento-INeC"}, "7201779989": {"Name": "Fry J.P.", "AuthorID": "7201779989", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006775964": {"Name": "Honour J.W.", "AuthorID": "7006775964", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "56450327200": {"Name": "Brand\u00e3o M.L.", "AuthorID": "56450327200", "AffiliationID": "114875604", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neuroci\u00eancias e Comportamento-INeC"}}}
