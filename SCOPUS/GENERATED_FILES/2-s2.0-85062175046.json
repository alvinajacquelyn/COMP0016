PEO data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). PEO, PEP, and PI data were used separately and in combination to differentiate diagnoses by pairwise and multinomial logistic regressions. Predicted diagnoses were compared with gold standard medical diagnoses.ResultsEFA/CFA identified a 4-factor structure of the PEO based on 26/31 questionnaire items with loadings \u22650.4. Observer-reported factors alone differentiated better between syncope and epilepsy than patient-reported factors (accuracy: 96% vs 85%, p = 0.0004). Observer-reported data improved accuracy over differentiation based on patient-reported data alone from 90% to 100% between syncope and epilepsy (p = 0.005), 76% to 83% between epilepsy and PNES (p = 0.006), and 93% to 95% between syncope and PNES (p = 0.098).ConclusionsInformation from observers can make an important contribution to the differentiation of epilepsy from syncope or PNES but adds less to that of syncope from PNES.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Conversion Disorder", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Epilepsy", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medical History Taking", "Middle Aged", "Observation", "Retrospective Studies", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Syncope", "Unconsciousness", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062175046", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57190569358": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57190569358", "AffiliationID": "60014211, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Gertrude H.
