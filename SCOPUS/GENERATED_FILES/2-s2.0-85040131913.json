We measured viraemia risk before, during and after pregnancy in HIV-infected women. Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, 1425 HIV-infected pregnant women on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least six months pre-pregnancy were enrolled in a cohort study in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Odds ratios were estimated in multilevel logistic regression, with pregnancy period time-varying. Results: Over half of 1425 women received tenofovir-based regimens (n = 791). Median pre-pregnancy ART duration was 2.1 years. Of 988 women (69.3%) with pre-pregnancy viral loads, 82.0%, 6.8% and 11.2% had VL <50, 50-999 and \u22651000 copies/ml, respectively. During pregnancy and at six, 12 and 24 months, viral load was \u22651000 copies/ml in 15.2%, 15.7%, 17.8% and 16.6% respectively; viral load <50 was 76.9%, 77%, 75.5% and 75.8%, respectively. Adjusting for age, clinical and pregnancy factors, viraemia risk (viral load \u226550 copies/ml) was not significantly associated with pregnancy [adjusted OR (aOR) 1.31; 95% CI 0.90-1.92], six months (aOR 1.30; 95% CI 0.83-2.04), 12 months (aOR 0.96; 95% CI 0.58-1.58) and 24 months (aOR 1.40; 95% CI 0.89-2.22) post-partum. Adjusting for ART duration\u2013pregnancy period interaction, viraemia risk was 1.8 during pregnancy and twofold higher post-partum. Conclusions: While undetectable viral load before pregnancy through post-partum was common, the UNAIDS goal to suppress viraemia in 90% of women was not met. Women on preconception ART remain vulnerable to viraemia; additional support is required to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission and maintain maternal health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "HIV infection", "post-partum", "pregnancy", "viraemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Longitudinal Studies", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Viral Load", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040131913", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55352876200": {"Name": "Chetty T.", "AuthorID": "55352876200", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Medicine, School of Nursing and Public Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "57203759981": {"Name": "Newell M.L.", "AuthorID": "57203759981", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Institute for Developmental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006806446": {"Name": "Coutsoudis A.", "AuthorID": "7006806446", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
