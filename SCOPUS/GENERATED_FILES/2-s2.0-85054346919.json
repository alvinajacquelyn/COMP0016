Nature uses organic molecules for light harvesting and photosynthesis, but most man-made water splitting catalysts are inorganic semiconductors. Organic photocatalysts, while attractive because of their synthetic tunability, tend to have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. Here we present a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) based on a benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety that shows a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution than its amorphous or semicrystalline counterparts. The COF is stable under long-term visible irradiation and shows steady photochemical hydrogen evolution with a sacrificial electron donor for at least 50 hours. We attribute the high quantum efficiency of fused-sulfone-COF to its crystallinity, its strong visible light absorption, and its wettable, hydrophilic 3.2 nm mesopores. These pores allow the framework to be dye-sensitized, leading to a further 61% enhancement in the hydrogen evolution rate up to 16.3 mmol g \u22121 h \u22121 . The COF also retained its photocatalytic activity when cast as a thin film onto a support.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054346919", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57204738302": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57204738302", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "54419624000": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "54419624000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, Materials Innovation Factory and Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool"}, "35766190000": {"Name": "Chong S.Y.", "AuthorID": "35766190000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "36632642600": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "36632642600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "23491285200": {"Name": "Clowes R.", "AuthorID": "23491285200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "28168104400": {"Name": "Yan Y.", "AuthorID": "28168104400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "36657600800": {"Name": "Sprick R.S.", "AuthorID": "36657600800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "7401832651": {"Name": "Cooper A.I.", "AuthorID": "7401832651", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, Materials Innovation Factory and Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool"}, "55587574000": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "55587574000", "AffiliationID": "60073625, 60011069", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials and Institute of Fine Chemicals, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "55868614400": {"Name": "Zhu W.H.", "AuthorID": "55868614400", "AffiliationID": "60073625, 60011069", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials and Institute of Fine Chemicals, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
