The in vivo analysis of transcription dynamics can be most directly monitored using RNA stem loop motifs derived from MS2 and other bacteriophages. Here we describe the implementation of the MS2 RNA detection system and the steps required for precise measurement of transcription dynamics in highly motile cells. Automated image processing techniques are used to track large numbers of cells and measure transcription in a systematic and unbiased manner. We discuss popular methods for automatic image segmentation and frame-to-frame tracking of cells, and the considerations required to make measurements as quantitatively as possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated image analysis", "Automatic image segmentation", "Dictyostelium", "Gene expression noise", "High content imaging", "MS2", "RNA FISH", "Single cell transcriptomics", "Stochastic gene expression", "Transcriptional bursting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Capsid Proteins", "Cell Survival", "Cytological Techniques", "Dictyostelium", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Levivirus", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921881405", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55213534800": {"Name": "Corrigan A.", "AuthorID": "55213534800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7006549122": {"Name": "Chubb J.", "AuthorID": "7006549122", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
