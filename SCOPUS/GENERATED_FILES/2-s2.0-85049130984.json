What happens if the sensory feedback finally received from the impact conflicts with this prediction? The present study shows that such conflict results in changes in the internal estimates of our body height: When the object people dropped takes longer than expected to hit the floor, they report feeling taller and behave as if their legs were longer. This provides the first evidence of cross-modal recalibration of body-height representations as a function of changes in the distant environment. Crucially, the recalibration results from a mismatch between the predicted and actual outcome of an action, the ball\u2019s release and impact, which are causally-related but separated in space and time. These results suggest that implicit models of object-motion can interact with implicit and explicit models of one\u2019s body height.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Height", "Cues", "Feedback, Sensory", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Touch", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049130984", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "Human and Information Science Laboratory, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), University College London"}, "16444349400": {"Name": "Asai T.", "AuthorID": "16444349400", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "Human and Information Science Laboratory, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}, "7405706538": {"Name": "Kimura T.", "AuthorID": "7405706538", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "Human and Information Science Laboratory, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}, "35792260000": {"Name": "Kitagawa N.", "AuthorID": "35792260000", "AffiliationID": "120881768", "AffiliationName": "Yoshika Institute of Psychology"}, "36760637300": {"Name": "Deroy O.", "AuthorID": "36760637300", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Munich Center for Neuroscience, Ludwig Maximilian University"}, "16425864500": {"Name": "Marquardt T.", "AuthorID": "16425864500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
