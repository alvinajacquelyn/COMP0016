Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pivotal inflammatory cytokine, but there is conflicting evidence as to whether it boosts or inhibits regulatory T cells (T reg cells). In this study, we show that the therapeutic anti-TNF antibody adalimumab, but not the soluble TNF receptor etanercept, paradoxically promoted the interaction between monocytes and T reg cells isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Adalimumab bound to monocyte membrane TNF from RA patients and unexpectedly enhanced its expression and its binding to TNF-RII expressed on T reg cells. As a consequence, adalimumab expanded functional Foxp3+ T reg cells equipped to suppress Th17 cells through an IL-2/ STAT5-dependent mechanism. Our data not only highlight the beneficial effect of membrane TNF on T reg cell numbers during chronic inflammation, but in addition reveal how a therapeutic antibody that is thought to act by simply blocking its target can enhance the regulatory properties of this proinflammatory cytokine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adalimumab", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Cell Membrane", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Monocytes", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Th17 Cells", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977632681", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57198994876": {"Name": "Nguyen D.X.", "AuthorID": "57198994876", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7004262550": {"Name": "Ehrenstein M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004262550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}}}
