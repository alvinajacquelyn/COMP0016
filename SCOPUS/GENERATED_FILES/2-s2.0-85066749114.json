In this paper, we show how magnetic ield emissions can be used to ingerprint smartphones. Previous work on identiication rely on speciic characteristics that vary with the settings and components available on a device. This limits the number of devices on which one approach is efective. By contrast, all electronic devices emit a magnetic ield which is accessible either through the API or measured through an external device. We conducted an in-the-wild study over four months and collected mobile sensor data from 175 devices. In our experiments we observed that the electromagnetic ield measured by the magnetometer identiies devices with an accuracy of 98.9%. Furthermore, we show that even if the sensor was removed from the device or access to it was discontinued, identiication would still be possible from a secondary device in close proximity to the target. Our indings suggest that the magnetic ield emitted by smartphones is unique and ingerprinting devices based on this feature can be performed without the knowledge or cooperation of users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ingerprint", "Magnetic ield", "Sensor readings", "Supervised learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Close proximity", "Electromagnetic emissions", "Electronic device", "Ingerprint", "Magnetic ield", "Mobile sensors", "Sensor readings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066749114", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57203129381": {"Name": "Perez B.", "AuthorID": "57203129381", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60111768", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute, University College London"}, "36810977700": {"Name": "Stringhini G.", "AuthorID": "36810977700", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}}}
