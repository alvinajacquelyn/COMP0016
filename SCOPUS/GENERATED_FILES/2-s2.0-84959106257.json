Methods: A prospective, randomized, investigator-masked, cross-over comparison was used. Inclusion criteria were ocular hypertension (OHT) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with a maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg on a preserved prostaglandin monotherapy. After 6 weeks washout, patients were randomized to BUDPF or LUDPF for 3 months and then switched to the other treatment for 3 months. IOP curves were performed at baseline and after each treatment period. Statistical analysis was performed in a R programming environment. Linear mixed modeling was used to account for repeated measures on the same subject and clustering of observations from the same center. Safety outcomes included visual acuity, adverse events, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ocular tolerability, and optic nerve assessment. Results: Analysis at 6 months (primary outcome) showed a 1.6 \u00b1 0.5-mmHg difference in IOP values between LUDPF and BUDPF (p < 0.01). A mean intra-subject IOP difference of 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 mmHg (LUDPF \u2013 BUDPF) was observed (p < 0.01). Significant differences in IOP were observed for both drugs at 3 and at 6 months compared to baseline: \u22124,0 \u00b1 0.5 mmHg for both BUDPF and LUDPF at 3 months (p < 0.01 for both drugs; p = 0.32 between the two drugs); \u22125.2 \u00b1 0.5 and \u22123.4 \u00b1 0.5 mmHg for BUDPF and LUDPF, respectively (both p < 0.01), at 6 months. Both drugs were tolerated well, the only statistically significant difference being lower hyperemia scores for LUDPF (albeit low for both drugs). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a superior efficacy of BUDPF over LUDPF in lowering IOP. The results are consistent both in the parallel comparison between the two treatment groups at 6 months as well as in the intra-subject pressure comparison.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bimatoprost", "Cross-over", "Latanoprost", "Preservative-free", "Prostaglandin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antihypertensive Agents", "Bimatoprost", "Cross-Over Studies", "Double-Blind Method", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Ocular Hypertension", "Ophthalmic Solutions", "Preservatives, Pharmaceutical", "Prospective Studies", "Prostaglandins F, Synthetic", "Slit Lamp", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959106257", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6602457968": {"Name": "Stalmans I.", "AuthorID": "6602457968", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "6507657212": {"Name": "Oddone F.", "AuthorID": "6507657212", "AffiliationID": "60103773", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Research Unit, G.B.Bietti Eye Foundation - IRCCS"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "ICORG - Imperial College Ophthalmologic Research Group, Western Eye Hospital"}, "6603241029": {"Name": "Hommer A.", "AuthorID": "6603241029", "AffiliationID": "116391456", "AffiliationName": "Hommer Ophthalmology Institute"}, "56681936600": {"Name": "Montesano G.", "AuthorID": "56681936600", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60016182", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Trials at San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan"}, "57078136300": {"Name": "Rossetti L.", "AuthorID": "57078136300", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60016182", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Trials at San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan"}, "36341161100": {"Name": "Ribeiro L.", "AuthorID": "36341161100", "AffiliationID": "60094275", "AffiliationName": "AIBILI - Association for Innovation and Biomedical Research on Light and Image, Centre for Clinical Trials, Azinhaga Santa Comba"}, "7801438454": {"Name": "Sunaric-M\u00e9gevand G.", "AuthorID": "7801438454", "AffiliationID": "116390424", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Center, M\u00e8morial A de Rotschild"}}}
