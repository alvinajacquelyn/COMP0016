We studied a cohort of 100 consecutively recruited, unrelated patients with DS; 87 had SCN1A mutations. Living cases had a median follow-up of 17 years. Seventeen patients died, at a median age of seven years (inter-quartile range 3\u201311 years) with causes of death: 10 SUDEP, four status epilepticus, two drowning and one asphyxia. The SUDEP classification included three Definite, one Definite Plus and six Probable. The Dravet-specific mortality rate/1000-person-years was 15.84 (98% CI 9.01\u201327.85). The Dravet-specific SUDEP rate was 9.32/1000-person-years (98% CI 4.46\u201319.45). The Dravet-specific SUDEP rate is the only documented syndrome-specific SUDEP rate. SUDEP in DS occurs mainly in childhood. It is also the highest SUDEP rate, considerably higher than the recent 5.1 SUDEP rate/1000-person-years for adults with refractory epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dravet syndrome", "Epilepsy", "Mortality", "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Death, Sudden", "Epilepsies, Myoclonic", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Mutation", "NAV1.1 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994036111", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56964662200": {"Name": "Cooper M.S.", "AuthorID": "56964662200", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "7006332397": {"Name": "Scheffer I.E.", "AuthorID": "7006332397", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne"}, "7202722687": {"Name": "Mcintosh A.", "AuthorID": "7202722687", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Brain Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "36147068800": {"Name": "Crompton D.E.", "AuthorID": "36147068800", "AffiliationID": "60030410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Northern Health"}, "56605585500": {"Name": "McMahon J.M.", "AuthorID": "56605585500", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005087", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Research Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Austin Health"}, "56579620600": {"Name": "Schneider A.", "AuthorID": "56579620600", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005087", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Research Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Austin Health"}, "7102859674": {"Name": "Farrell K.", "AuthorID": "7102859674", "AffiliationID": "60086967, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Paediatrics, University of British Columbia, Child and Family Research Institute"}, "7102334584": {"Name": "Ganesan V.", "AuthorID": "7102334584", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Institute of Child Health"}, "13409004900": {"Name": "Gill D.", "AuthorID": "13409004900", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "TY Nelson Department of Neurology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "17035082400": {"Name": "Kivity S.", "AuthorID": "17035082400", "AffiliationID": "60015234", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pediatric Neurology, Schneider Children's Medical Centre of Israel"}, "7004801181": {"Name": "Lerman-Sagie T.", "AuthorID": "7004801181", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurology Unit, Wolfson Medical Centre, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University"}, "9250117800": {"Name": "McLellan A.", "AuthorID": "9250117800", "AffiliationID": "60001060", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosciences, Royal Hospital For Sick Children"}, "6603113302": {"Name": "Pelekanos J.", "AuthorID": "6603113302", "AffiliationID": "117624779", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurologist"}, "55429374700": {"Name": "Ramesh V.", "AuthorID": "55429374700", "AffiliationID": "60011993", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Newcastle General Hospital"}, "6507079397": {"Name": "Sadleir L.", "AuthorID": "6507079397", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "University of Otago"}, "6603731456": {"Name": "Wirrell E.", "AuthorID": "6603731456", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Child and Adolescent Neurology and Epilepsy, Mayo Clinic"}}}
