All rights reserved. No commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted.Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) delivery via an implanted pump is frequently used for the treatment of spasticity. This is an effective and safe neurosurgical and pharmacological intervention associated with an improvement in patient quality of life. There is, however, a risk of device-related infection. We present a patient with pump-site infection and Escherichia coli meningitis secondary to transcolonic perforation of an intrathecal baclofen pump catheter. While this is rare, we review the intraoperative precautions and best practices that should be taken to prevent and manage this unusual complication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multiple sclerosis", "neurosurgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Baclofen", "Catheterization", "Catheters, Indwelling", "Device Removal", "Disabled Persons", "Female", "Humans", "Iatrogenic Disease", "Infusion Pumps, Implantable", "Infusions, Spinal", "Intestinal Perforation", "Meningitis, Escherichia coli", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Muscle Relaxants, Central", "Recurrence", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039774420", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56845207100": {"Name": "Devine O.P.", "AuthorID": "56845207100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "56845248400": {"Name": "Harborne A.C.", "AuthorID": "56845248400", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}, "35590180800": {"Name": "Lo W.B.", "AuthorID": "35590180800", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}, "56975822300": {"Name": "Price R.", "AuthorID": "56975822300", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Royal Stoke University Hospital"}}}
