Three lakes on an altitudinal transect were studied using chironomid subfossils to provide the first estimates of late Holocene climate in this remote, poorly studied region of Arctic Russia. The analysis of sediment cores from three closely located lakes is rare in palaeoenvironmental studies and enables the role of other environmental variables, which may be a potential source of error in palaeoclimatic reconstructions, to be assessed. The chironomid-based reconstructions suggest a more maritime climate c. 3400 cal. BP with July temperatures c. 1.5\u00b0C warmer than present which cooled rapidly by c. 2\u00b0C, with a more continental climate between 3200 and 2600 cal. BP. These trends are similar in timing and scale to other northern hemisphere records. The recent chironomid records from all three lakes show pronounced faunal changes over the last 50 years probably directly or indirectly because of climate-driven changes in catchment hydrology. This is particularly evident in the recent record from an open lake within a large wetland habitat, which appears relatively insensitive to changes in July air temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chironomids", "Climate", "Continentality", "Holocene", "Putor", "Russia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918550961", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"23478887200": {"Name": "Self A.E.", "AuthorID": "23478887200", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Natural History Museum"}, "7401651179": {"Name": "Brooks S.J.", "AuthorID": "7401651179", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Natural History Museum"}, "23044212200": {"Name": "Jones V.J.", "AuthorID": "23044212200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
