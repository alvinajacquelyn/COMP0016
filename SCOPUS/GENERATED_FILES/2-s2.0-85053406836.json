While there is growing research around recruitment, navigating this literature to support an evidence-based approach remains difficult. The Online resource for Recruitment Research in Clinical triAls project aims to create an online searchable database of recruitment research to improve access to existing evidence and to identify gaps for future research. Methods: MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Methodology Register, Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index within the ISI Web of Science and Education Resources Information Center were searched in January 2015. Search strategy results were screened by title and abstract, and full text obtained for potentially eligible articles. Studies reporting or evaluating strategies, interventions or methods used to recruit patients were included along with case reports and studies exploring reasons for patient participation or non-participation. Eligible articles were categorised as systematic reviews, nested randomised controlled trials and other designs evaluating the effects of recruitment strategies (Level 1); studies that report the use of recruitment strategies without an evaluation of impact (Level 2); or articles reporting factors affecting recruitment without presenting a particular recruitment strategy (Level 3). Articles were also assigned to 1, or more, of 42 predefined recruitment domains grouped under 6 categories. Results: More than 60,000 records were retrieved by the search, resulting in 56,030 unique titles and abstracts for screening, with a further 23 found through hand searches. A total of 4570 full text articles were checked; 2804 were eligible. Six percent of the included articles evaluated the effectiveness of a recruitment strategy (Level 1), with most of these assessing aspects of participant information, either its method of delivery (33%) or its content and format (28%). Discussion: Recruitment to clinical trials remains a common challenge and an important area for future research. The online resource for Recruitment Research in Clinical triAls project provides a searchable, online database of research relevant to recruitment. The project has identified the need for researchers to evaluate their recruitment strategies to improve the evidence base and broaden the narrow focus of existing research to help meet the complex challenges faced by those recruiting to clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accrual", "barriers and facilitators", "clinical trial", "randomised controlled trial", "Recruitment", "recruitment interventions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Databases as Topic", "Humans", "Patient Selection", "Sample Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053406836", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56364012300": {"Name": "Kearney A.", "AuthorID": "56364012300", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60171639", "AffiliationName": "North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Liverpool"}, "57207603922": {"Name": "Harman N.L.", "AuthorID": "57207603922", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60171639", "AffiliationName": "North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Liverpool"}, "57212501855": {"Name": "Williamson P.R.", "AuthorID": "57212501855", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60171639", "AffiliationName": "North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Liverpool"}, "8860728600": {"Name": "Gamble C.", "AuthorID": "8860728600", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60171639", "AffiliationName": "North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Liverpool"}, "57191166941": {"Name": "Rosala-Hallas A.", "AuthorID": "57191166941", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "57192113573": {"Name": "Beecher C.", "AuthorID": "57192113573", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Health Research Board \u2013 Trials Methodology Research Network, National University of Ireland"}, "56988798700": {"Name": "Healy P.", "AuthorID": "56988798700", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Health Research Board \u2013 Trials Methodology Research Network, National University of Ireland"}, "7003664999": {"Name": "Blazeby J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003664999", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "ConDuCT-II Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Bristol"}, "7102059960": {"Name": "Mills N.", "AuthorID": "7102059960", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "ConDuCT-II Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Bristol"}, "56229605700": {"Name": "Rooshenas L.", "AuthorID": "56229605700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "ConDuCT-II Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Bristol"}, "56048179800": {"Name": "Rowlands C.", "AuthorID": "56048179800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "ConDuCT-II Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Bristol"}, "7006635012": {"Name": "Bower P.", "AuthorID": "7006635012", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60171639", "AffiliationName": "North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, Population Health Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57203600170": {"Name": "Clarke M.", "AuthorID": "57203600170", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Northern Ireland Methodology Hub, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "54927709800": {"Name": "Maguire L.", "AuthorID": "54927709800", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Northern Ireland Methodology Hub, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "57190395012": {"Name": "Cragg W.", "AuthorID": "57190395012", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "55969679800": {"Name": "Duane S.", "AuthorID": "55969679800", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Health Research Board \u2013 Trials Methodology Research Network, College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, National University of Ireland"}, "57191252464": {"Name": "Gardner H.", "AuthorID": "57191252464", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "57197392906": {"Name": "Treweek S.", "AuthorID": "57197392906", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "8525662100": {"Name": "Vellinga A.", "AuthorID": "8525662100", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National University of Ireland"}}}
