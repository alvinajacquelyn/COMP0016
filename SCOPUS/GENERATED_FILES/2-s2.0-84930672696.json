Based on two strong reformulations of the problem, we present a transformed reformulation and valid inequalities that speed up column generation and Lagrange relaxation. We demonstrate computationally how both ideas enhance the performance of our algorithm and show theoretically how they are related to dual space reduction techniques. We compare several solution methods and propose a new efficient hybrid scheme that combines column generation and Lagrange relaxation in a novel way. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution method for finding lower bounds is competitive with textbook approaches and state-of-The-Art approaches found in the literature. Finally, we design a branch-And-price-based heuristic and report computational results. The heuristic scheme compares favorably or outperforms other approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accepted by Karen Aardal", "Branch and price", "Column generation", "Heuristics History", "Lagrange relaxation", "Lot sizing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accepted by Karen Aardal", "Branch and price", "Column generation", "Lagrange relaxation", "Lot sizing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930672696", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"17345152400": {"Name": "De Araujo S.A.", "AuthorID": "17345152400", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada, Universidade Estadual Paulista"}, "6603375785": {"Name": "De Reyck B.", "AuthorID": "6603375785", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}, "6603794232": {"Name": "Degraeve Z.", "AuthorID": "6603794232", "AffiliationID": "60010057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Science and Operations, London Business School"}, "23008168800": {"Name": "Fragkos I.", "AuthorID": "23008168800", "AffiliationID": "60070152, 60022265", "AffiliationName": "Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdamn"}, "6701846535": {"Name": "Jans R.", "AuthorID": "6701846535", "AffiliationID": "60002970, 60007104", "AffiliationName": "HEC Montreal and GERAD"}}}
