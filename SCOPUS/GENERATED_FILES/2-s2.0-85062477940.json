Such interventions reached their peak with the enactment of the UK Domestic Gas Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act in July 2018. The Act puts in place a requirement on the independent regulator, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), to set an absolute price cap on poor value tariffs. As such, it signals a repudiation of the overarching paradigm of consumer empowerment that has informed regulatory remedies to date. Rather than advocating for a different paradigm, this article highlights the difficulties inherent in reconciling price caps \u2013 both practically and conceptually \u2013 with the competitive process and consumer empowerment. It also discussses other instruments, not necessarily exhausted in retail price regulation, that can render affordable energy prices, without sacrificing consumer empowerment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062477940", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"56610694100": {"Name": "Ioannidou M.", "AuthorID": "56610694100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, School of Law"}, "57168891700": {"Name": "Mantzari D.", "AuthorID": "57168891700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Faculty of Laws"}}}
