Thereby this sector plays a significant role within the transformation process of economic systems, yet the capacities of it remain up till now underestimated. This paper suggests a holistic approach to assess transformation potential of the supply chain and logistics sector towards more sustainable economic systems while defining innovative business strategies to meet future macroeconomic developments. This is achieved through an integrated assessment of production and consumption systems, considering the interests of the key stakeholders. Moreover, the paper combines advanced methods to develop future macroeconomic scenarios and to assess the strategic business opportunities of the supply chain and logistics sector addressing societal developments, e.g. new consumption patterns. The analysis relies on modern theories of Environmental and Ecological Economics, contributing to transformation theories. Moreover, the innovative role of supply chain and logistics management in achieving sustainable macroeconomic goals at regional and international levels is addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Scenario-strategy development", "Sustainable consumer", "sustainable macroeconomics", "Sustainable supply chains", "Transformation roadmap"], "IndexKeywords": ["Roadmap", "Strategy development", "Sustainable consumer", "sustainable macroeconomics", "Sustainable supply chains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066021940", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55319442500": {"Name": "Melkonyan A.", "AuthorID": "55319442500", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "University of Duisburg-Essen, Centre for Logistics and Traffic"}, "57196403231": {"Name": "Krumme K.", "AuthorID": "57196403231", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Logistics and Traffic, University of Duisburg-Essen, Joint Centre Urban Systems"}, "57196403823": {"Name": "Gruchmann T.", "AuthorID": "57196403823", "AffiliationID": "60014057", "AffiliationName": "Westcoast University of Applied Sciences"}, "7006502092": {"Name": "Spinler S.", "AuthorID": "7006502092", "AffiliationID": "60012481", "AffiliationName": "Logistics Management at WHU \u2013 Otto Beisheim School of Management, Director K\u00fchne-Institute for Logistics Management, Campus Vallendar"}, "24476885300": {"Name": "Schumacher T.", "AuthorID": "24476885300", "AffiliationID": "60018625", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Management, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology"}, "6603227818": {"Name": "Bleischwitz R.", "AuthorID": "6603227818", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Global Resources, Head of Department Bartlett School Env, Energy & Resources, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London, Institute for Sustainable Resources, ISR"}}}
