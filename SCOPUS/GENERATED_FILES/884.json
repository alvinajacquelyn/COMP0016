This unintelligibility may then lead to troubles in interaction. Robillard (1994, 1999) for example reports specific problems relating to the timing of turns and the context of prior talk as well as difficulties in initiating repair. Additional work highlighting socially consensual \u2018real time\u2019 in talk, states that problems in temporal co-ordination may be seen as contributing to the perception of communicative (in)competence among people with speech disorders (Higginbotham and Wilkins 1999).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015837266", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"15030938100": {"Name": "Bloch S.", "AuthorID": "15030938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Human Communication Disorders, University College London"}}}
