Plasma concentration of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)\u2014central in the pathogenesis of AD\u2014is a logical candidate, but studies to date have produced conflicting results on its utility. Methods Plasma samples from 339 preclinical AD cases (76.4% women, mean age 61.3 years) and 339 age- and sex-matched dementia-free controls, taken an average of 9.4 years before AD diagnosis, were analyzed using Luminex xMAP technology and INNO-BIA plasma A\u03b2 form assays to determine concentrations of free plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. Results Plasma concentrations of free A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 did not differ between preclinical AD cases and dementia-free controls, in the full sample or in subgroups defined according to sex and age group (<60 and \u2265 60 years). The interval between sampling and AD diagnosis did not affect the results. A\u03b2 concentrations did not change in the years preceding AD diagnosis among individuals for whom longitudinal samples were available. Discussion Plasma concentrations of free A\u03b2 could not predict the development of clinical AD, and A\u03b2 concentrations did not change in the years preceding AD diagnosis in this sample. These results indicate that free plasma A\u03b2 is not a useful biomarker for the identification of individuals at risk of developing clinical AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "A\u03b2", "Biomarker", "Dementia", "Plasma amyloid \u03b2", "Preclinical Alzheimer's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008611356", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"13105550300": {"Name": "L\u00f6vheim H.", "AuthorID": "13105550300", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Geriatric Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "56446314000": {"Name": "Eriksson S.", "AuthorID": "56446314000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Nutritional Research, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "55978164900": {"Name": "Elgh F.", "AuthorID": "55978164900", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, Virology, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "34770225600": {"Name": "Johansson A.", "AuthorID": "34770225600", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Nutritional Research, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7006749585": {"Name": "Hallmans G.", "AuthorID": "7006749585", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biobank Research, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
