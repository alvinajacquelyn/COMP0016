Design/methodology/approach: The interpretative methodology employing two methods of engaged scholarship, namely, action research and engaged research, is applied. The data are analyzed using cognitive mapping to identify the extent of alignment of perceptions. Findings: The findings show that the client and its supply chain are very transactional in their management minimizing investment in KM and program management. There is a lack of commitment and cultural leadership; hence, there is over-reliance on individuals to take responsibility for knowledge sharing and application. SD thinking can help develop a holistic approach to learning from projects. Research limitations/implications: The study underlines the links between the concepts of SD and KM. The findings emphasize the importance of developing a holistic approach to KM through the lenses of SD. The organizations must view KM as a process and build capabilities at a program level to make knowledge sharing an integral part of the work culture across projects. Originality/value: The study contributes to the subject of KM in the construction industry by mobilizing the concept of SD to examine how KM systems and procedures are embedded in the client and across its supply chain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive mapping", "Knowledge management", "Programme management", "Service design", "Supply chain", "Systems thinking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058863476", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"55243351300": {"Name": "Duryan M.", "AuthorID": "55243351300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "13410539800": {"Name": "Smyth H.", "AuthorID": "13410539800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
