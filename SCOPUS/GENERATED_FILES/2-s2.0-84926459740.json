This project led by members of the Health Inequalities Group of the Royal College of General Practitioners in collaboration with the Institute of Health Equity, University College London sought to fill this gap. Discussion: We conducted a Delphi poll using our teaching and stakeholder networks. We identified 5 areas for learning focusing on key knowledge and skills. These were population concepts, health systems, marginalised patient groups, cultural diversity and ethics. Summary: These intended learning outcomes about health inequalities represent the best available evidence to date for colleagues seeking to develop core undergraduate medical curricula on the topic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expert consensus", "Intended learning outcomes", "Tackling health inequalities", "Undergraduate medical curriculum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Competence", "Cultural Diversity", "Curriculum", "Delphi Technique", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Educational Measurement", "Ethics, Medical", "Health Status Disparities", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Social Marginalization", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926459740", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55370835600": {"Name": "Williamson A.", "AuthorID": "55370835600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "General Practice and Primary Care, School of Medicine, University of Glasgow"}, "56012978700": {"Name": "Ayres R.", "AuthorID": "56012978700", "AffiliationID": "60115301, 60024779", "AffiliationName": "Plymouth Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Plymouth"}, "55477922200": {"Name": "Allen J.", "AuthorID": "55477922200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Health Equity, University College London"}, "57207811596": {"Name": "Macleod U.", "AuthorID": "57207811596", "AffiliationID": "60107756", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Population Sciences, Hull York Medical School"}}}
