This study provides a number of source terms for characterisation of plumes in large fissure eruptions, in Iceland and elsewhere. We characterised the chemistry of aerosol particle matter (PM) and gas in the Holuhraun plume, and its evolution as the plume dispersed, both via measurements and modelling. The plume was sampled at the eruptive vent, and in two populated areas in Iceland. The plume caused repeated air pollution events, exceeding hourly air quality standards (350 \u03bcg/m3) for SO2 on 88 occasions in Reykjahl\u00ed\u00f0 town (100 km distance), and 34 occasions in Reykjav\u00edk capital area (250 km distance). Average daily concentration of volcanogenic PM sulphate exceeded 5 \u03bcg/m3 on 30 days in Reykjav\u00edk capital area, which is the maximum concentration measured during non-eruptive background interval. There are currently no established air quality standards for sulphate. Combining the results from direct sampling and dispersion modelling, we identified two types of plume impacting the downwind populated areas. The first type was characterised by high concentrations of both SO2 and S-bearing PM, with a high Sgas/SPM mass ratio (SO2(g)/SO4 2\u2212 (PM) > 10). The second type had a low Sgas/SPM ratio (<10). We suggest that this second type was a mature plume where sulphur had undergone significant gas-to-aerosol conversion in the atmosphere. Both types of plume were rich in fine aerosol (predominantly PM1 and PM2.5), sulphate (on average \u223c90% of the PM mass) and various trace species, including heavy metals. The fine size of the volcanic PM mass (75\u201380% in PM2.5), and the high environmental lability of its chemical components have potential adverse implications for environmental and health impacts. However, only the dispersion of volcanic SO2 was forecast in public warnings and operationally monitored during the eruption. We make a recommendation that sulphur gas-to-aerosol conversion processes, and a sufficiently large model domain to contain the transport of a tropospheric plume on the timescale of days be utilized for public health and environmental impact forecasting in future eruptions in Iceland and elsewhere in the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["air quality", "environment", "Iceland", "volcanic emissions", "volcanic eruption", "volcanic plume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environment", "Icelands", "Volcanic emission", "Volcanic eruptions", "Volcanic plume"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020452227", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"36604470400": {"Name": "Ilyinskaya E.", "AuthorID": "36604470400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "49261186800": {"Name": "Schmidt A.", "AuthorID": "49261186800", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7005396592": {"Name": "Mather T.A.", "AuthorID": "7005396592", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences"}, "7005272495": {"Name": "Pope F.D.", "AuthorID": "7005272495", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "56127170000": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "56127170000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "23136004900": {"Name": "Sanderson P.", "AuthorID": "23136004900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57204987677": {"Name": "Witham C.", "AuthorID": "57204987677", "AffiliationID": "60018258", "AffiliationName": "Met Office"}, "7102068236": {"Name": "Baxter P.", "AuthorID": "7102068236", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, School of Clinical Medicine"}, "54892112300": {"Name": "J\u00f3hannsson T.", "AuthorID": "54892112300", "AffiliationID": "112590369", "AffiliationName": "Environment Agency of Iceland"}, "12779071400": {"Name": "Pfeffer M.", "AuthorID": "12779071400", "AffiliationID": "60071130", "AffiliationName": "Icelandic Meteorological Office"}, "55691911100": {"Name": "Barsotti S.", "AuthorID": "55691911100", "AffiliationID": "60071130", "AffiliationName": "Icelandic Meteorological Office"}, "6507238179": {"Name": "Bergsson B.", "AuthorID": "6507238179", "AffiliationID": "60071130", "AffiliationName": "Icelandic Meteorological Office"}, "57194501506": {"Name": "McCormick Kilbride B.", "AuthorID": "57194501506", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "36975235800": {"Name": "Donovan A.", "AuthorID": "36975235800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, King's College London"}, "7103110450": {"Name": "Edmonds M.", "AuthorID": "7103110450", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, King's College London"}, "35220363000": {"Name": "Peters N.", "AuthorID": "35220363000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "7005631653": {"Name": "Oppenheimer C.", "AuthorID": "7005631653", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}}}
