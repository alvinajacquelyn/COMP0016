We go on to show how new research has modified these assumptions, pointing to a wide range of individual differences at every level of description. We argue that, in the context of significant increases in DS life expectancy, a focus on individual differences in trisomy 21 at all levels-genetic, cellular, neural, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental-constitutes one of the best approaches for understanding genotype/phenotype relations in DS and for exploring risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease in this high-risk population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964624214", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003649617": {"Name": "Karmiloff-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "7003649617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS), University College London"}, "56151388400": {"Name": "D'Souza H.", "AuthorID": "56151388400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS), University College London"}, "55548189700": {"Name": "Massand E.", "AuthorID": "55548189700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS), University College London"}, "56764220000": {"Name": "Al-Janabi T.", "AuthorID": "56764220000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7801476527": {"Name": "Groet J.", "AuthorID": "7801476527", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "The Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36437536800": {"Name": "Mok K.", "AuthorID": "36437536800", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "48663029800": {"Name": "Startin C.", "AuthorID": "48663029800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57203069236": {"Name": "Fisher E.", "AuthorID": "57203069236", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7003483313": {"Name": "Nizetic D.", "AuthorID": "7003483313", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University"}, "7003735726": {"Name": "Tybulewicz V.", "AuthorID": "7003735726", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57203057616": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "57203057616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
