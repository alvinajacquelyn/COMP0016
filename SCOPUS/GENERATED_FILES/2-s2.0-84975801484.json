The nanolithography process is facile and scalable, enabling fabrication of highly ordered periodic patterns over entire wafers as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Direct silicon etching with high aspect ratio templated by the block copolymer mask is realized without any intermediate layer or external precursors. Uniquely, an atomic layer deposition (ALD)-assisted method is introduced to allow reversing of the morphology relative to the initial pattern. As a result, highly ordered silicon nanopillar arrays are fabricated with controlled aspect ratios. After metallization, the resulting nanopillar arrays are suitable for SERS applications. These structures readily exhibit an average SERS enhancement factor of above 108, SERS uniformities of 8.5% relative standard deviation across 4 cm, and 6.5% relative standard deviation over 5 \u00d7 5 mm2 surface area, as well as a very low SERS background. The as-prepared SERS substrate, with a good enhancement and large-area uniformity, is promising for practical SERS sensing applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["block copolymer lithography", "nanofabrication", "plasmonic nanomaterials", "SERS uniformity", "surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Block copolymer lithography", "Intermediate layers", "Nanofabrication process", "Relative standard deviations", "Sensing applications", "SERS uniformity", "Solvent-vapor annealing", "Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975801484", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56542093100": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "56542093100", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "56122234800": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "56122234800", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "6507315121": {"Name": "Rindzevicius T.", "AuthorID": "6507315121", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "56984649600": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56984649600", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "23973258700": {"Name": "Schulte L.", "AuthorID": "23973258700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "7404397966": {"Name": "Schmidt M.", "AuthorID": "7404397966", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "7004114136": {"Name": "Boisen A.", "AuthorID": "7004114136", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}, "6603256406": {"Name": "Ndoni S.", "AuthorID": "6603256406", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)"}}}
