Firstly, the target pursuit model for intelligent vehicles was established and described in this text. Then, the research work for global motion planning was carried out based on Stackelberg Differential Game Theory, and the global optimal solution was obtained by using the survival type differential game. Finally, to overcome errors, we use a polynomial method to achieve the smooth motion planning. So, based on Terminal Sliding Mode method, the Active Front Steering controller design was used to calculate the desired active wheel angle for intelligent vehicle path tracking. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method for intelligent vehicles\u2019 path planning and tracking.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Controller design", "Differential game", "Intelligent vehicle", "Path planning", "Polynomial method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active front steering", "Autonomous control systems", "Controller designs", "Differential games", "Global optimal solutions", "Optimal path planning", "Polynomial methods", "Stackelberg differential games"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996537103", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"36130681900": {"Name": "Wang H.w.", "AuthorID": "36130681900", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, South China University of Technology"}, "36640172300": {"Name": "You F.", "AuthorID": "36640172300", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, South China University of Technology"}, "55387404800": {"Name": "Yu X.c.", "AuthorID": "55387404800", "AffiliationID": "60003078", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University"}, "57199094588": {"Name": "Song H.b.", "AuthorID": "57199094588", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Virginia University"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lu Z.h.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23389476400": {"Name": "Lloret J.", "AuthorID": "23389476400", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communications, Polytechnic University of Valencia"}}}
