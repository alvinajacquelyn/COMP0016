The main objective is to investigate how heavy mineral assemblages reflect different source rocks and hence different provenance areas. These data contribute to a better understanding of East Antarctica ice dynamics in the Ross Sea sector during the Early Miocene (17.6\u201320.2 Ma), a time of long-term global warming and sea level rise. The AND-2A drill core recovered several stratigraphic intervals that span from Early Miocene to Pleistocene and it collected a variety of terrigenous lithologies. The heavy mineral assemblages of the lower 650-m-thick sedimentary succession were analyzed through SEM observations and SEM\u2013EDS microanalyses on heavy mineral grains. The heavy mineral analysis shows that the sediments are a mix of detritus dominated by McMurdo Volcanic Group sources most likely located in the present-day Mount Morning area (Proto-Mount Morning) with minor contribution from Transantarctic Mountains source rocks located west of the drill site. The heavy mineral assemblages in Interval 1 indicate that between 20.2 and 20.1 Ma, the grounding line of the ice sheet advanced to a position near the present-day Mount Morning volcanic center. During deposition of Interval 2 (20.1\u201319.3 Ma), the ice sheet most likely experienced a dynamic behavior with interval of ice advance alternating with periods of ice retreat, while Interval 3 (19.3\u201318.7 Ma) records further retreat to open water conditions. A dynamic behavior is noted in Interval 4 (18.7\u201317.6 Ma) with a decreasing contribution of materials derived from the basalts of the Mount Morning volcanic center located to the south of the drill site and a consequent increasing contribution of materials derived from the Transantarctic Mountains to the west of the drill site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANDRILL", "Antarctica", "Early Miocene", "Heavy mineral analysis", "Ice sheet", "Ross Sea"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925501661", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Oceanogr\u00e1fico da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7006942969": {"Name": "Giorgetti G.", "AuthorID": "7006942969", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, della Terra e dell\u2019Ambiente, Universit\u00e0 di Siena"}, "56444524500": {"Name": "Turbanti Memmi I.", "AuthorID": "56444524500", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, della Terra e dell\u2019Ambiente, Universit\u00e0 di Siena"}, "6603335509": {"Name": "Passchier S.", "AuthorID": "6603335509", "AffiliationID": "60012621", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, Montclair State University"}}}
