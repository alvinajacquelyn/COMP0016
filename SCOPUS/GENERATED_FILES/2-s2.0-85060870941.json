The theory predicts that hydrodynamic forces produce a negligible first normal stress difference, while contact forces produce a positive first normal stress difference. The theory thereby provides a rationale for seemingly contradicting experimental observations in the literature. In addition, the theory captures the experimentally observed time dependence of the shear stress after shear reversal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Contact forces", "First normal stress difference", "Hard spheres", "Hydrodynamic forces", "Interaction forces", "Normal contact force", "Particle suspensions", "Time dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060870941", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"16177628100": {"Name": "Gillissen J.", "AuthorID": "16177628100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35104042400": {"Name": "Wilson H.", "AuthorID": "35104042400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
