Here, we conducted the first systematic review of literature on the potential economic effects of ocean acidification. We identified that while there is a growing literature discussing this topic, assessments of the direction and magnitude of anticipated economic change remain limited. The few assessments which have been conducted indicate largely negative economic effects of ocean acidification. Insights are, however, limited as the scope of the studies remains restricted. We propose that understanding of this topic will benefit from using standard approaches (e.g. timescales and emissions scenarios) to consider an increasing range of species/habitats and ecosystem services over a range of spatial scales. The resulting understanding could inform decisions such that we maintain, or enhance, economic services obtained from future marine environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon dioxide", "Climate change", "Ecosystem services", "Socio-economic", "Systematic literature review", "Warming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ecosystem", "Environment", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Oceans and Seas", "Research", "Seawater"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010764283", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"32067660600": {"Name": "Falkenberg L.", "AuthorID": "32067660600", "AffiliationID": "60026169", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), NIVA Region West"}, "57191016037": {"Name": "Tubb A.", "AuthorID": "57191016037", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Resources, UCL Australia, University College London"}}}
