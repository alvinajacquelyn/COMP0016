Methods: The study sample was obtained from the Young Finns study and comprised 757 participants (399 women, 53%). The bidirectional association between cynicism and job strain over a 6-year-follow-up was examined with a cross-lagged structural equation model, controlling for a number of demographic variables. Results: High job strain (\u03b2 = 0.08; P = 0.007) was associated with higher baseline-adjusted cynicism 6 years later. Nevertheless, cynicism was not associated with baseline-adjusted job strain. The additional analysis showed that cynicism mediated 21.5% of the relationship between job strain and depression. Conclusions: Perceptions of having a highly strenuous job may elicit mistrustful and cynical attitudes in employees, which in turn may lead to mental health problems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Depression", "Female", "Finland", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Models, Statistical", "Occupational Diseases", "Prospective Studies", "Psychological Tests", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941209785", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55313671300": {"Name": "T\u00f6rnroos M.", "AuthorID": "55313671300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "IBS, Unit of Personality, Work and Health Psychology, University of Helsinki"}, "7003614400": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "7003614400", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "7005916684": {"Name": "Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen L.", "AuthorID": "7005916684", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "IBS, Unit of Personality, Work and Health Psychology, University of Helsinki"}, "55921083600": {"Name": "Hintsa T.", "AuthorID": "55921083600", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "IBS, Unit of Personality, Work and Health Psychology, University of Helsinki"}, "8402684300": {"Name": "Pulkki-R\u00e5back L.", "AuthorID": "8402684300", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Work and Mental Health Unit"}, "55347556900": {"Name": "Hakulinen C.", "AuthorID": "55347556900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "IBS, Unit of Personality, Work and Health Psychology, University of Helsinki"}, "23995485200": {"Name": "Merjonen P.", "AuthorID": "23995485200", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Psychology, VU University"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8892161900": {"Name": "Hintsanen M.", "AuthorID": "8892161900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, University of Helsinki"}, "7102121079": {"Name": "Theorell T.", "AuthorID": "7102121079", "AffiliationID": "60027398, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stress Research Institute, University of Stockholm"}, "7004828916": {"Name": "Raitakari O.", "AuthorID": "7004828916", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Turku University Hospital"}}}
