At the same time, researchers' degrees of freedom make it hard to assess the robustness of effects. Replication research can help evaluate how reproducible an effect is. We present the first replication in verbal deception research whereby ferry passengers were instructed to tell the truth or lie about their travel plans. The original study found truth-tellers to include more specific time references in their answers. The replication study that closely mimicked the setting, procedure, materials, coding, and analyses found no lie\u2013truth difference for specific time references. Although the power of our replication study was suboptimal (0.77), Bayesian statistics showed evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Given the great applied consequences of verbal credibility tests, we hope this first replication attempt ignites much needed preregistered, high-powered, multilab replication efforts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deception detection", "intentions", "replication", "verbal credibility assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050452728", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"56518219900": {"Name": "Kleinberg B.", "AuthorID": "56518219900", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "7004860356": {"Name": "Arntz A.", "AuthorID": "7004860356", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "6602849119": {"Name": "Verschuere B.", "AuthorID": "6602849119", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "36609513900": {"Name": "Warmelink L.", "AuthorID": "36609513900", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University"}}}
