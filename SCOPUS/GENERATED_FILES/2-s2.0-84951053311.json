Protein modelling has enabled the rational design of unique proteins, but high-throughput screening of large libraries is still required to identify proteins with potentially valuable properties. Here we report on the development and evaluation of a novel fluorescent activated cell sorting based screening platform. Single bacterial cells, expressing a protein library to be screened, are electronically sorted and deposited onto plates containing solid nutrient growth media in a dense matrix format of between 44 and 195 colonies/cm2.We show that this matrix format is readily applicable to machine interrogation (<30 seconds per plate) and subsequent bioinformatic analysis (\u223c60 seconds per plate) thus enabling the high-throughput screening of the protein library. We evaluate this platform and show that bacteria containing a bioluminescent protein can be spectrally analysed using an optical imager, and a rare clone (0.5% population) can successfully be identified, picked and further characterised. To further enhance this screening platform, we have developed a prototype electronic sort stream multiplexer, that when integrated into a commercial flow cytometric sorter, increases the rate of colony deposition by 89.2% to 24 colonies per second. We believe that the screening platform described here is potentially the foundation of a new generation of high-throughput screening technologies for proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteria", "Computational Biology", "Flow Cytometry", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Pichia", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951053311", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56730327300": {"Name": "Stowe C.", "AuthorID": "56730327300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6603720207": {"Name": "Pizzey A.", "AuthorID": "6603720207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57211009223": {"Name": "Pule M.", "AuthorID": "57211009223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "36993672300": {"Name": "Badar A.", "AuthorID": "36993672300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
