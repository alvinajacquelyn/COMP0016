The purpose of this review was to examine prevalence, policies, and treatment systems of comorbid substance misuse and psychotic illness in Europe, illustrating differences and similarities with US findings. Methods: Based on computerized main databases searches, a narrative review was performed. Results: The availability of substances but also the social contexts in terms of individual and local issues are factors likely to explain different dual diagnosis prevalence rates in Europe as compared with the USA. Conclusions: Integrated models implemented following US example might perform differently within the context of well-established European Union (EU) community mental health services. Such programs would require additional resources and radical redesign of service delivery systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual diagnosis", "Europe", "USA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community Mental Health Services", "Comorbidity", "Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)", "Europe", "European Union", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Substance-Related Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925851371", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "55249556900": {"Name": "Bartoli F.", "AuthorID": "55249556900", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55962320600": {"Name": "Brambilla G.", "AuthorID": "55962320600", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55634683100": {"Name": "Crocamo C.", "AuthorID": "55634683100", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca"}}}
