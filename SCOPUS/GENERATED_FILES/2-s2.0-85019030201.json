Dopamine replacement therapy can reverse these manifestations with varying degrees of improvement. Methods: To evaluate functional connectivity in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and changes in functional connectivity in relation to the degree of response to l-dopa, 19 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the on-medication state. Scans were obtained on a 3-Tesla scanner in 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2.5 mm3 voxels. Seed-based bivariate regression analyses were carried out with atlas-defined basal ganglia regions as seeds, to explore relationships between functional connectivity and improvement in the motor section of the UPDRS-III following an l-dopa challenge. False discovery rate-corrected P was set at < 0.05 for a 2-tailed t test. Results: A greater improvement in UPDRS-III scores following l-dopa administration was characterized by higher resting-state functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the striatum (P = 0.001) and lower resting-state functional connectivity between the pallidum (P = 0.001), subthalamic nucleus (P = 0.003), and the paracentral lobule (supplementary motor area, mesial primary motor, and primary sensory areas). Conclusions: Our findings show characteristic basal ganglia resting-state functional connectivity patterns associated with different degrees of l-dopa responsiveness in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. l-Dopa exerts a graduated influence on remapping connectivity in distinct motor control networks, potentially explaining some of the variance in treatment response. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basal ganglia", "connectivity", "l-dopa", "Parkinson's disease", "resting state"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Connectome", "Corpus Striatum", "Dopamine Agents", "Female", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Parkinson Disease", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Sensorimotor Cortex", "Subthalamic Nucleus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019030201", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23768093200": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "23768093200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56009814500": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "56009814500", "AffiliationID": "60032333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Jefferson University Hospitals"}, "8069852700": {"Name": "Behrens T.", "AuthorID": "8069852700", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7004536701": {"Name": "Ashburner J.", "AuthorID": "7004536701", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602508148": {"Name": "De Vita E.", "AuthorID": "6602508148", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
