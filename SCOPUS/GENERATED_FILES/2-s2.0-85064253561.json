One of the most popular approaches proposed this as \"passivated codoping\", whereby an equal number of donor and acceptor dopants are introduced into the lattice, producing a charge neutral system with a reduced band gap. Using the archetypal codoping pairs of [Nb + N]- and [Ta + N]-doped anatase, we demonstrate using hybrid density functional theory that passivated codoping is not achievable in TiO2. Our results indicate that the natural defect chemistry of the host system (in this case n-type anatase TiO2) is dominant, and so concentration parity of dopant types is not achievable under any thermodynamic growth conditions. The implications of passivated codoping for band gap manipulation in general are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Donor and acceptor", "Growth conditions", "Hybrid density functional theory", "Materials scientist", "Natural defect", "Neutral systems", "Photo-catalytic", "Visible-light activity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064253561", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.A.D.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "56736199700": {"Name": "Buckeridge J.", "AuthorID": "56736199700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56524305000": {"Name": "Chadwick N.P.", "AuthorID": "56524305000", "AffiliationID": "60112905", "AffiliationName": "Bio Nano Consulting"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Centre, Chemistry Department, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Centre, Chemistry Department, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Centre, Chemistry Department, University College London"}}}
