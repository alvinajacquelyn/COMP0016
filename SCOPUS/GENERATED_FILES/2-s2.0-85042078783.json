KGaA, WeinheimNeural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing cells that generate the major cell types of the central nervous system, namely neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, during embryonic development and in the adult brain. NSCs reside in a complex niche where they are exposed to a plethora of signals, including both soluble and physical signals such as compressive and shear stresses, but also discontinuities and differences in morphology of the extracellular environment, termed as topographical features. Different approaches that incorporate artificial micro- and nano-scale surface topographical features have been developed aiming to recapitulate the in vivo NSC niche discontinuities and features, particularly for in vitro studies. The present review article aims at reviewing the existing body of literature on the use of artificial micro- and nano-topographical features to control NSCs orientation and differentiation into neuronal and/or neuroglial lineage. The different approaches on the study of the underlying mechanism of the topography-guided NSC responses are additionally revised and discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["differentiation", "micro-/nano-fabrication", "neural stem cells", "orientation", "topography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Nanotechnology", "Neural Stem Cells", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042078783", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55987630400": {"Name": "Simitzi C.", "AuthorID": "55987630400", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)"}, "25639592500": {"Name": "Karali K.", "AuthorID": "25639592500", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)"}, "23010133500": {"Name": "Ranella A.", "AuthorID": "23010133500", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)"}, "56234734200": {"Name": "Stratakis E.", "AuthorID": "56234734200", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)"}}}
