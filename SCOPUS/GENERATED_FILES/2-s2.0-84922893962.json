This accumulation is the histological hallmark of these disorders although the phenotype shows variable overlap. Hepatomegaly, hypoglycaemia, elevated lactate and urate with or without neutrophil dysfunction is the classical presentation for the commonest disorders namely GSD types I a, 1b and III. Elevated creatine kinase, weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with or without rhabdomyolysis represents the commonest muscle subtypes with the best known ones being GSD II, III and V. Control of glucose deficiency by added calories, tube feeding or modified cornstarch is frequently the mainstay of treatment. Supportive therapies are needed to establish near normality. Potential curative therapies are enzyme replacement therapies by mode of liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation or use of recombinant enzyme.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone marrow transplantation", "Cornstarch", "Enzyme replacement therapy", "GSD or glycogen storage disease", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Inborn error of glycogen metabolism", "Liver transplantation", "Rhabdomyolysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922893962", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"55907064300": {"Name": "Hendriksz C.", "AuthorID": "55907064300", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Inst. of Child Health"}}}
