We compared 2 weeks of a gratitude intervention with an active control (everyday events reporting) and no treatment conditions in 119 young women. The treatment elicited increases in hedonic well-being, optimism and sleep quality along with decreases in diastolic blood pressure. Improvements in subjective well-being were correlated with increased sleep quality and reductions in blood pressure, but there were no relationships with cortisol. This brief intervention suggests that subjective well-being may contribute towards lower morbidity and mortality through healthier biological function and restorative health behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biological responses", "gratitude", "intervention", "sleep", "subjective well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Optimism", "Personal Satisfaction", "Psychotherapy", "Sleep", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988699123", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"54782783300": {"Name": "Jackowska M.", "AuthorID": "54782783300", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Whitelands College, University of Roehampton"}, "57030730700": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "57030730700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55926917100": {"Name": "Ronaldson A.", "AuthorID": "55926917100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
