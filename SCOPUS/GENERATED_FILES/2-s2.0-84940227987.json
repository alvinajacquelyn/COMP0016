Methods and results: The present study was an observational cohort study of patients with STEMI treated consecutively with PPCI between 2004 and 2011 at a single centre. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at a median follow-up of 3 years. Among 2727 patients, 1600 (58.7%) underwent PPCI via the femoral route. The femoral group was older (64.7 vs. 61.7 years; P<0.0001), and had higher rates of diabetes (18.6% vs. 16.0%; P<0.0001), previous PCI (11.2 vs. 7.8%; P=0.004), previous myocardial infarction (15.3 vs. 8.3%; P<0.0001) and cardiogenic shock (9.8 vs. 1.3%; P<0.0001). Bleeding complications were more frequent in the femoral group (4.7 vs. 1.2%; P<0.0001). The 5-year death rate was significantly higher in the femoral group than in the radial group (10.4 vs. 3.0%; P<0.0001). After adjustment for confounding variables, bleeding complications [heart rate 2.07 (95% confidence interval 1.05-4.08)] and femoral access [heart rate 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.02-2.53)] were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. After stratification using the propensity score, excess long-term mortality in patients treated via the femoral approach was predominantly in patients with a high baseline risk of death. Conclusion: Patients undergoing PPCI via the femoral route are at a higher risk of adverse short-term and long-term outcomes than patients undergoing PPCI via the radial route. Patients with a high baseline risk may benefit most from radial access, and future outcome studies should focus on the most at-risk patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Access", "Femoral", "Myocardial infarction", "Primary percutaneous coronary intervention", "Radial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Femoral Artery", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Radial Artery", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940227987", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"27867977800": {"Name": "Rathod K.S.", "AuthorID": "27867977800", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "55568508950": {"Name": "Jones D.A.", "AuthorID": "55568508950", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "26641821000": {"Name": "Bromage D.I.", "AuthorID": "26641821000", "AffiliationID": "60011243, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, London Chest Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56895678300": {"Name": "Gallagher S.M.", "AuthorID": "56895678300", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "55969205500": {"Name": "Rathod V.S.", "AuthorID": "55969205500", "AffiliationID": "60011243, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, London Chest Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7004749998": {"Name": "Kennon S.", "AuthorID": "7004749998", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "7202380964": {"Name": "Knight C.", "AuthorID": "7202380964", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "57189045665": {"Name": "Rothman M.T.", "AuthorID": "57189045665", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "7201657327": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "7201657327", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "7408612732": {"Name": "Smith E.", "AuthorID": "7408612732", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "56347651700": {"Name": "Jain A.K.", "AuthorID": "56347651700", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "55905293300": {"Name": "Archbold R.A.", "AuthorID": "55905293300", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}, "7006779954": {"Name": "Wragg A.", "AuthorID": "7006779954", "AffiliationID": "60011243", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, London Chest Hospital"}}}
