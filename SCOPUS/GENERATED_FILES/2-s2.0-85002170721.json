Design: Qualitative semistructured focus groups and interviews with trainees and trainers. Setting: Postgraduate medical training in London, Yorkshire and Humber, Kent, Surrey and Sussex, and Wales during the junior doctor contract dispute at the end of 2015. Part of a larger General Medical Council study about the fairness of postgraduate medical training. Participants: 96 trainees and 41 trainers. Trainees comprised UK graduates and International Medical Graduates, across all stages of training in 6 specialties (General Practice, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Psychiatry, Radiology, Surgery) and Foundation. Results: Postgraduate training was characterised by work-life imbalance. Long hours at work were typically supplemented with revision and completion of the e-portfolio. Trainees regularly moved workplaces which could disrupt their personal lives and sometimes led to separation from friends and family. This made it challenging to cope with personal pressures, the stresses of which could then impinge on learning and training, while also leaving trainees with a lack of social support outside work to buffer against the considerable stresses of training. Low morale and harm to well-being resulted in some trainees feeling dehumanised. Work-life imbalance was particularly severe for those with children and especially women who faced a lack of less-than-full-time positions and discriminatory attitudes. Female trainees frequently talked about having to choose a specialty they felt was more conducive to a work-life balance such as General Practice. The proposed junior doctor contract was felt to exacerbate existing problems. Conclusions: A lack of work-life balance in postgraduate medical training negatively impacted on trainees' learning and well-being. Women with children were particularly affected, suggesting this group would benefit the greatest from changes to improve the work-life balance of trainees.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Medical Staff, Hospital", "Qualitative Research", "Sex Factors", "United Kingdom", "Work-Life Balance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002170721", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57192165072": {"Name": "Rich A.", "AuthorID": "57192165072", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57002953700": {"Name": "Viney R.", "AuthorID": "57002953700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57192161902": {"Name": "Needleman S.", "AuthorID": "57192161902", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "25223923300": {"Name": "Woolf K.", "AuthorID": "25223923300", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16230131500": {"Name": "Griffin A.", "AuthorID": "16230131500", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School"}}}
