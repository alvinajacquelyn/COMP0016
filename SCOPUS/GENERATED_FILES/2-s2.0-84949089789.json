The main cause of the landslides is torrential rain in short period of time. This area experiences several landslides each year, resulting in casualties, property damage, and economic loss. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to produce the Landslide Susceptibility Maps for CMA so that appropriate landslide disaster risk reduction strategies can be developed. In this research, three different Geographic Information System-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis methods\u2014the Artificial Hierarchy Process (AHP), Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), and Ordered Weighted Average (OWA)\u2014were applied to scientifically assess the landslide susceptible areas in CMA. Nine different thematic layers or landslide causative factors were considered. Then, seven different landslide susceptible scenarios were generated based on the three weighted overlay techniques. Later, the performances of the methods were validated using the area under the relative operating characteristic curves. The accuracies of the landslide susceptibility maps produced by the AHP, WLC_1, WLC_2, WLC_3, OWA_1, OWA_2, and OWA_3 methods were found as 89.80, 83.90, 91.10, 88.50, 90.40, 95.10, and 87.10 %, respectively. The verification results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility maps produced and the existing data on the 20 historical landslide locations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial Hierarchy Process (AHP)", "Geographic Information System (GIS)", "Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM)", "Ordered Weighted Average (OWA)", "Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC)", "Weighted Linear Combination (WLC)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hierarchy process", "Landslide susceptibility mapping", "Ordered weighted average", "Relative operating characteristics", "Weighted linear combinations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949089789", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction (IRDR), Department of Earth Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}}}
