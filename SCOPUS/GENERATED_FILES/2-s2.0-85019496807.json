Such data, however, lack semantic information such as the interaction of individuals with the transportation modes available. On the other hand, traditional mobility surveys provide detailed snapshots of the relation between socio-demographic characteristics and choice of transportation modes. Transportation mode detection is currently approached using features such as speed, acceleration and direction either on their own or in combination with GIS data. Combining such information with socio-demographic characteristics of travellers has the potential of offering a richer modelling framework that could facilitate better transportation mode detection using variables such as age and disability. In this paper, we explore the possibility to include both elements of the environment and individual characteristics of travellers in the task of transportation mode detection. Using dynamic Bayesian Networks, we model the transition matrix to account for such auxiliary data by using an informative Dirichlet prior constructed using data from traditional mobility surveys. Results have shown that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy with the most widely used classification algorithms while having a rich modelling framework, even in the case of sparse mobility data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disabilities", "Dynamic Bayesian networks", "Mobility", "Smartphones", "Transportation mode detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disabilities", "Dynamic Bayesian networks", "Environmental characteristic", "Individual characteristics", "Mobile phone applications", "Socio-demographic characteristics", "Spatial and temporal resolutions", "Transportation mode"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019496807", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57193014061": {"Name": "Bantis T.", "AuthorID": "57193014061", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, SpaceTime Lab"}, "37080789000": {"Name": "Haworth J.", "AuthorID": "37080789000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, SpaceTime Lab"}}}
