All rights reserved.Aims: We aimed to examine the prevalence, clinical outcomes and procedural characteristics of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) complicated by coronary artery perforation (CAP) in a contemporary patient population. Methods and results: Procedural records of 39,115 patients undergoing PCI between 2005 and 2016 were reviewed. CAP affected 149 cases (0.37%). The prevalence of CAP increased from 0.31% in 2005 to 0.45% in 2016 (p=0.03), reflecting an increase in more complex PCI (from 14% in 2005 to 21% in 2016; p<0.0001). CAP was associated with increased all-cause mortality (23.1% vs. 9.4% in those without perforation; p=0.0054) and was an independent predictor of mortality (HR 2.55; 95% CI: 1.34-4.78). In-patient mortality was 4% (6/149). In 43 of 149 (28.9%) cases, a significant pericardial effusion ensued and mortality rates were higher in this subgroup. Thirty-one patients had covered stents (CS) inserted and five did not survive to discharge. Of the 26 patients with a CS who survived to hospital discharge, six (23.1%) had definite stent thrombosis, and two (7.7%) had possible/probable stent thrombosis. Conclusions: CAP remains uncommon but the prevalence is increasing. CAP is associated with significant short- and long-term mortality, particularly when there is haemodynamic compromise necessitating pericardiocentesis. Covered stents are a valuable tool but they are associated with a high risk of stent thrombosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Pericardial effusion", "Stent thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Coronary Vessels", "Drug-Eluting Stents", "Female", "Heart Injuries", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Thrombosis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027230561", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"24481305600": {"Name": "Guttmann O.P.", "AuthorID": "24481305600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55568508950": {"Name": "Jones D.A.", "AuthorID": "55568508950", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "20435956700": {"Name": "Gulati A.", "AuthorID": "20435956700", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7003845955": {"Name": "Crake T.", "AuthorID": "7003845955", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6507229201": {"Name": "Ozkor M.", "AuthorID": "6507229201", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7006779954": {"Name": "Wragg A.", "AuthorID": "7006779954", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7408612732": {"Name": "Smith E.J.", "AuthorID": "7408612732", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "36793254500": {"Name": "Weerackody R.", "AuthorID": "36793254500", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7202380964": {"Name": "Knight C.J.", "AuthorID": "7202380964", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7201657327": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "7201657327", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "26644292900": {"Name": "O'Mahony C.", "AuthorID": "26644292900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "38661453500": {"Name": "Kotecha T.", "AuthorID": "38661453500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56950600900": {"Name": "Fayed H.", "AuthorID": "56950600900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212154606": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "57212154606", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
