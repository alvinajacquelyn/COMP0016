A large red-shift of the emission is achieved by capping InAs QDs with a thin GaAsSb layer. Sharp lines, representing emission from single QDs, are observed out to wavelengths as long as 1540 nm. Comparison is made to the optical properties of a nominally identical active region structure grown on a GaAs substrate. Single QD emission from a Si-based system at 1500 nm has the potential for single photon sources compatible with current optical fibers and reduced complexity of integration with drive electronics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-band", "GaAsSb", "III-V semiconductors", "quantum dots", "Si substrate", "single-photon sources"], "IndexKeywords": ["C-bands", "Drive electronics", "GaAs substrates", "GaAsSb", "Reduced complexity", "Si substrates", "Single quantum dot", "Single-photon source"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025069966", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36844401300": {"Name": "Orchard J.", "AuthorID": "36844401300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Sheffield, Hicks Building"}, "7004995703": {"Name": "Mowbray D.", "AuthorID": "7004995703", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Sheffield, Hicks Building"}, "56421974500": {"Name": "Woodhead C.", "AuthorID": "56421974500", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Lancaster"}, "56422168300": {"Name": "Noori Y.", "AuthorID": "56422168300", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Lancaster"}, "24559654500": {"Name": "Young R.", "AuthorID": "24559654500", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Lancaster"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003483616": {"Name": "Beanland R.", "AuthorID": "7003483616", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
