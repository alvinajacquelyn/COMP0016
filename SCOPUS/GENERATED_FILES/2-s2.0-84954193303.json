The conductivity, Seebeck and Hall effect were measured in the basal plane between 200 and 400 K. Distinct differences in electron transport were observed above and below the magnetic transition temperature of hematite at \u223c265 K (the Morin transition, TM). Above 265 K, transport was found to agree with the adiabatic small-polaron model, the conductivity was characterized by an activation energy of \u223c100 meV and the Hall effect was dominated by the weak ferromagnetism of the material. A room temperature electron drift mobility of \u223c10-2 cm2 V-1 s-1 was estimated. Below TM, the activation energy increased to \u223c160 meV and a conventional Hall coefficient could be determined. In this regime, the Hall coefficient was negative and the corresponding Hall mobility was temperature-independent with a value of \u223c10-1 cm2 V-1 s-1. Seebeck coefficient measurements indicated that the silicon donors were fully ionized in the temperature range studied. Finally, we observed a broad infrared absorption upon doping and tentatively assign the feature at \u223c0.8 eV to photon-assisted small-polaron hops. These results are discussed in the context of existing hematite transport studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adiabatic small polaron", "Chemical vapor transport", "Electron drift mobility", "Electronic transport", "Magnetic transition temperature", "Seebeck coefficient measurement", "Temperature independents", "Weak ferromagnetism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954193303", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55201215900": {"Name": "Rettie A.", "AuthorID": "55201215900", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55234573000": {"Name": "Mullins C.", "AuthorID": "55234573000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55053258700": {"Name": "Chemelewski W.", "AuthorID": "55053258700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin"}, "56512635300": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56512635300", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin"}, "8302439800": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "8302439800", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57053259000": {"Name": "Wygant B.", "AuthorID": "57053259000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7003750012": {"Name": "Lindemuth J.", "AuthorID": "7003750012", "AffiliationID": "105712314", "AffiliationName": "Lake Shore Cryotronics"}, "7501722154": {"Name": "Lin J.", "AuthorID": "7501722154", "AffiliationID": "60110749", "AffiliationName": "Center for High Pressure Science and Technology Advanced Research (HPSTAR)"}, "57213371238": {"Name": "Eisenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57213371238", "AffiliationID": "60001109, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "Van't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Amsterdam"}, "8070987300": {"Name": "Brauer C.", "AuthorID": "8070987300", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "7404018901": {"Name": "Johnson T.", "AuthorID": "7404018901", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "57053329500": {"Name": "Beiswenger T.", "AuthorID": "57053329500", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "7101783532": {"Name": "Ash R.", "AuthorID": "7101783532", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Maryland"}}}
