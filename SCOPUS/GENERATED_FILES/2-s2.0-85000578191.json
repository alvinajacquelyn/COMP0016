Despite the importance of this problem, the research community still lacks a comprehensive understanding of what these stolen accounts are used for. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the modus operandi of miscreants accessing stolen Gmail accounts. We developed an infrastructure that is able to monitor the activity performed by users on Gmail accounts, and leaked credentials to 100 accounts under our control through various means, such as having information-stealing malware capture them, leaking them on public paste sites, and posting them on underground forums. We then monitored the activity recorded on these accounts over a period of 7 months. Our observations allowed us to devise a taxonomy of malicious activity performed on stolen Gmail accounts, to identify differences in the behavior of cybercriminals that get access to stolen accounts through different means, and to identify systematic attempts to evade the protection systems in place at Gmail and blend in with the legitimate user activity. This paper gives the research community a better understanding of a so far understudied, yet critical aspect of the cybercrime economy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cybercrime", "Malware", "Underground Economy", "Webmail"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cybercrime", "Legitimate users", "Malicious activities", "Modus operandi", "Protection systems", "Research communities", "Underground Economy", "Webmail"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000578191", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56369054900": {"Name": "Onaolapo J.", "AuthorID": "56369054900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189589235": {"Name": "Mariconti E.", "AuthorID": "57189589235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36810977700": {"Name": "Stringhini G.", "AuthorID": "36810977700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
