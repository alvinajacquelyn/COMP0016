However, we believe that wearable sensing can go beyond the individual and offer insights into social dynamics and interactions with other users by considering multi-user data. In this work, we present a new approach to using wrist-worn wearables for social monitoring and the detection of social interaction features based on interpersonal synchrony - An approach transferable to smartwatches and fitness trackers. We build up on related work in the field of psychology and present a study where we collected wearable sensing data during a social event with 24 participants. Our preliminary results indicate differences in wearable sensing data during a social interaction between two people.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interpersonal synchrony", "Social sensing", "Wearable technology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Health monitoring", "Interpersonal synchrony", "New approaches", "Related works", "Social dynamics", "Social interactions", "Social sensing", "Wearable sensing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055980263", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"57191502201": {"Name": "H\u00e4nsel K.", "AuthorID": "57191502201", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "56380446100": {"Name": "Katevas K.", "AuthorID": "56380446100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "22984162100": {"Name": "Alomainy A.", "AuthorID": "22984162100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "14123619400": {"Name": "Orgs G.", "AuthorID": "14123619400", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths University"}, "7403445239": {"Name": "Richardson D.", "AuthorID": "7403445239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24766186400": {"Name": "Haddadi H.", "AuthorID": "24766186400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}}}
