IPA solvent annealing (IPA SA) of PbI2 films was carried out at different temperatures. The grain size, compactness, roughness and morphology of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films were seriously affected by annealing methods. Similarly, weakly coordinating solvent annealing process was also employed to anneal all inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite in a one-step method. A continuous and dense CsPbI3 film with uniform grain size was obtained. We recognized that weakly coordinating solvent annealing for perovskite could regulate the dissolution-recrystallization process via controlling the volume of residual solvent in perovskite intermediate films. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reached 17.4% and that of CsPbI3 PSCs reached 2.5% based on this sequential IPA SA process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["perovskite solar cells", "recrystallization", "solvent annealing", "weak coordinating solvent"], "IndexKeywords": ["Annealing methods", "Coordinating solvents", "Dissolution-recrystallization process", "Nucleation mechanism", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Sequential deposition", "Solvent annealing", "Uniform grain size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045947313", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57192198429": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57192198429", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56990540700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "56990540700", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57191971496": {"Name": "Ahmad W.", "AuthorID": "57191971496", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56462172600": {"Name": "Ying X.", "AuthorID": "56462172600", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56384018000": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "56384018000", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57196160327": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57196160327", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57201864305": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "57201864305", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Center for Nanoscale Science & Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, and School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
