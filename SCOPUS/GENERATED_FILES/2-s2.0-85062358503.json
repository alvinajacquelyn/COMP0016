While borehole seismometers on land produce seismic waveform data somewhat free of human-induced noise, they might have a drawback of an uncertain orientation. This study calculates a harmonic decomposition of teleseismic receiver functions from the P and PP phases and determines the orientation of a seismometer by minimizing a constant term in a harmonic expansion of tangential receiver functions in backazimuth near and at 0 s. This method normalizes the effect of seismic sources and determines the orientation of a seismometer without having to assume for an isotropic medium. Compared to the method of minimizing the amplitudes of a mean of the tangential receiver functions near and at 0 s, the method yields more accurate orientations in cases where the backazimuthal coverage of earthquake sources (even in the case of ocean bottom seismometers) is uneven and incomplete. We apply this method to data from the Korean seismic network (52 broad-band velocity seismometers, 30 of which are borehole sensors) to estimate the sensor orientation in the period of 2005-2016. We also track temporal changes in the sensor orientation through the change in the polarity and the amplitude of the tangential receiver function. Six borehole stations are confirmed to experience a significant orientation change (10\u00b0-180\u00b0) over the period of 10 yr. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by estimating the orientation of ocean bottom sensors, which are known to have high noise level during the relatively short deployment period.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body waves", "Crustal structure", "Seismic anisotropy", "Seismic instruments", "Wave propagation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Harmonic decomposition", "Harmonic expansion", "Ocean bottom seismometer", "Orientation changes", "Receiver functions", "Seismic anisotropy", "Sensor orientation", "Teleseismic receiver functions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062358503", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56330870100": {"Name": "Lim H.", "AuthorID": "56330870100", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "37028646500": {"Name": "Kim Y.H.", "AuthorID": "37028646500", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "7202363863": {"Name": "Song T.R.A.", "AuthorID": "7202363863", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Seismological Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "24832263700": {"Name": "Shen X.", "AuthorID": "24832263700", "AffiliationID": "60003725", "AffiliationName": "Lanzhou Institute of Seismology, China Earthquake Administration"}}}
