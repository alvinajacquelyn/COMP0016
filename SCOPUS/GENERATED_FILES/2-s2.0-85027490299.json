Nevertheless, so far there is no specific evaluation tool for large-group lectures that is based on these categories. This paper reports the development and psychometric validation of a short German evaluation tool for large-group lectures in medical education (SETMED-L: 'Student Evaluation of Teaching in MEDical Lectures') based on the SFDP-categories. Methods: Data were collected at two German medical schools. In Study 1, a full information factor analysis of the new 14-item questionnaire was performed. In Study 2, following cognitive debriefings and adjustments, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed. The model was tested for invariance across medical schools and student gender. Convergent validity was assessed by comparison with results of the FEVOR questionnaire. Results: Study 1 (n = 922) yielded a three-factor solution with one major (10 items) and two minor factors (2 items each). In Study 2 (n = 2740), this factor structure was confirmed. Scale reliability ranged between \u03b1 = 0.71 and \u03b1 = 0.88. Measurement invariance was given across student gender but not across medical schools. Convergent validity in the subsample tested (n = 246) yielded acceptable results. Conclusion: The SETMED-L showed satisfactory to very good psychometric characteristics. The main advantages are its short yet comprehensive form, the integration of SFDP-categories and its focus on medical education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evaluation", "Lecture", "Medical education", "Psychometrics", "Questionnaire", "SETMED-L"], "IndexKeywords": ["Congresses as Topic", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Faculty, Medical", "Female", "Germany", "Humans", "Male", "Pilot Projects", "Professional Competence", "Program Evaluation", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Students, Medical", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Teaching"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027490299", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57194287332": {"Name": "M\u00fcller T.", "AuthorID": "57194287332", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57200811182": {"Name": "Anders S.", "AuthorID": "57200811182", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "56029231700": {"Name": "Montano D.", "AuthorID": "56029231700", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57133198400": {"Name": "Poinstingl H.", "AuthorID": "57133198400", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen"}, "6602583180": {"Name": "Von Steinb\u00fcchel N.", "AuthorID": "6602583180", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57194271500": {"Name": "Dreiling K.", "AuthorID": "57194271500", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Centre G\u00f6ttingen"}, "23135592200": {"Name": "Raupach T.", "AuthorID": "23135592200", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Education Research and Curriculum Development, G\u00f6ttingen University Medical Centre"}, "57194267369": {"Name": "Schiekirka-Schwake S.", "AuthorID": "57194267369", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Education Research and Curriculum Development, G\u00f6ttingen University Medical Centre"}}}
