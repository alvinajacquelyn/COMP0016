Although area-based foliar N concentrations were typically lower for savanna trees, there was no difference in photosynthetic rates between the two vegetation formation types. Opposite to N, area-based P concentrations were\u2014on average\u2014slightly lower for forest trees; a dependency of photosynthetic characteristics on foliar P was only evident for savanna trees. Thus savanna trees use N more efficiently than their forest counterparts, but only in the presence of relatively high foliar P. Along with some other recent studies, these results suggest that both N and P are important modulators of woody tropical plant photosynthetic capacities, influencing photosynthetic metabolism in different ways that are also biome specific. Attempts to find simple unifying equations to describe woody tropical vegetation photosynthesis-nutrient relationships are likely to meet with failure, with ecophysiological distinctions between forest and savanna requiring acknowledgement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Global change", "Nutrient", "Photosynthesis", "Terrestrial productivity", "Tropical rain forest"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa", "Biodiversity", "Cameroon", "Ecosystem", "Electron Transport", "Forests", "Grassland", "Nitrogen", "Phosphorus", "Photosynthesis", "Plant Leaves", "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase", "Species Specificity", "Trees", "Tropical Climate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931575944", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"6507886390": {"Name": "Ferreira Domingues T.", "AuthorID": "6507886390", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Filosofia Ci\u00eancias e Letras de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "57203104307": {"Name": "Grace J.", "AuthorID": "57203104307", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "6602529747": {"Name": "Meir P.", "AuthorID": "6602529747", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7007019891": {"Name": "Ishida F.Y.", "AuthorID": "7007019891", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Sciences (TESS) and School of Marine and Tropical Biology, James Cook University"}, "7402365467": {"Name": "Lloyd J.", "AuthorID": "7402365467", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55323559100": {"Name": "Feldpausch T.R.", "AuthorID": "55323559100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "20735876100": {"Name": "Schrodt F.", "AuthorID": "20735876100", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "iDiv, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle"}, "56105640400": {"Name": "Lewis S.", "AuthorID": "56105640400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "13410827900": {"Name": "Saiz G.", "AuthorID": "13410827900", "AffiliationID": "60027314, 60102538", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research"}, "6506694260": {"Name": "Sene O.", "AuthorID": "6506694260", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Yaound\u00e9"}, "6602680004": {"Name": "Sonk\u00e9 B.", "AuthorID": "6602680004", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Yaound\u00e9"}, "26321184200": {"Name": "Taedoumg H.", "AuthorID": "26321184200", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Yaound\u00e9"}, "6604003297": {"Name": "Veenendaal E.M.", "AuthorID": "6604003297", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecosystem Studies, University of Wageningen"}}}
