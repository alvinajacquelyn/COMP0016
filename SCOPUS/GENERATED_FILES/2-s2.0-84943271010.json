We highlight the behavioral, neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and computational laws that subtend BSC in humans and non-human primates. We propose that BSC includes body-centered perception (hand, face, and trunk), based on the integration of proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual bodily inputs, and involves spatio-temporal mechanisms integrating multisensory bodily stimuli within peripersonal space (PPS). We develop four major constraints of BSC (proprioception, body-related visual information, PPS, and embodiment) and argue that the fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal processing of trunk-centered multisensory signals in PPS is of particular relevance for theoretical models and simulations of BSC and eventually of self-consciousness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Body Image", "Brain", "Consciousness", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Parietal Lobe", "Perception", "Proprioception", "Self Concept", "Sensation", "Space Perception", "Temporal Lobe", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943271010", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7004111524": {"Name": "Blanke O.", "AuthorID": "7004111524", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Geneva"}, "23390163100": {"Name": "Serino A.", "AuthorID": "23390163100", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, Center for Neuroprosthetics and Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "7202932472": {"Name": "Slater M.", "AuthorID": "7202932472", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
