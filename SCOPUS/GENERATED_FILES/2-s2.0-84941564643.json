Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Anti-angiogenic treatments against \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin fail to block tumour growth in the long term, which suggests that the tumour vasculature escapes from angiogenesis inhibition through \u03b1v\u03b23- integrin-independent mechanisms. Here, we show that suppression of \u03b23-integrin in mice leads to the activation of a neuropilin-1 (NRP1)- dependent cell migration pathway in endothelial cells via amechanism that depends on NRP1's mobilisation away from mature focal adhesions following VEGF-stimulation. The simultaneous genetic targeting of both molecules significantly impairs paxillin-1 activation and focal adhesion remodelling in endothelial cells, and therefore inhibits tumour angiogenesis and the growth of already established tumours. These findings provide a firm foundation for testing drugs against thesemolecules in combination to treat patients with advanced cancers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Focal adhesion", "Integrin", "Neuropilin-1", "Tumour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Adhesion", "Cytoplasm", "Cytoskeleton", "Endothelial Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Focal Adhesions", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Integrin beta3", "Integrins", "Lung", "Melanoma, Experimental", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microcirculation", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Neuropilin-1", "Paxillin", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941564643", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)", "IMMU", "2401"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55883337400": {"Name": "Ellison T.S.", "AuthorID": "55883337400", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "56425224600": {"Name": "Atkinson S.J.", "AuthorID": "56425224600", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "16445201500": {"Name": "Steri V.", "AuthorID": "16445201500", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "56841429900": {"Name": "Kirkup B.M.", "AuthorID": "56841429900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "56841630000": {"Name": "Preedy M.E.J.", "AuthorID": "56841630000", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "57199372880": {"Name": "Johnson R.T.", "AuthorID": "57199372880", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "34971032900": {"Name": "Edwards D.R.", "AuthorID": "34971032900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "35243350400": {"Name": "Robinson S.D.", "AuthorID": "35243350400", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7404423712": {"Name": "Schneider J.G.", "AuthorID": "7404423712", "AffiliationID": "60072562, 60023686", "AffiliationName": "Luxembourg Center for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg and Saarland University Medical Center, Internal Medicine II"}, "57204300774": {"Name": "Weilbaecher K.", "AuthorID": "57204300774", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University in St Louis"}}}
