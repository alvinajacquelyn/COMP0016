The cortical excitability was assessed before and after the intervention measuring the peak-to-peak amplitude of the Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) induced through transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses. Eight healthy subjects participated in the experiments. Results showed an overall and distributed increase in the cortical excitability as a result of the proposed intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055318586", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"15521293100": {"Name": "Resqu\u00edn F.", "AuthorID": "15521293100", "AffiliationID": "60104924", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University of Asunci\u00f3n"}, "7003422871": {"Name": "Brunetti F.", "AuthorID": "7003422871", "AffiliationID": "60104924", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University of Asunci\u00f3n"}, "57212057392": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez J.", "AuthorID": "57212057392", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Deparment, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57201300772": {"Name": "Herrero O.", "AuthorID": "57201300772", "AffiliationID": "60022146", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute"}, "7202123192": {"Name": "Pons J.L.", "AuthorID": "7202123192", "AffiliationID": "60022146", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute"}, "57194759767": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Vargas J.", "AuthorID": "57194759767", "AffiliationID": "60117290", "AffiliationName": "Ottobock Healthcare Gmbh"}}}
