Previous production studies have shown that both Mandarin-speaking adults and Mandarin-speaking children mark focus by prosodic information (Ouyang and Kaiser in Lang Cogn Neurosc 30(1\u20132):57\u201372, 2014; Yang and Chen in Prosodic focus marking in Chinese four-and eight-year-olds, 2014). However, while prosodic focus marking did not seem to affect sentence comprehension in adults Mandarin-speaking children showed enhanced sentence comprehension when the sentence focus was marked by prosodic information in a previous study (Chen in Appl Psycholinguist 19(4):553\u2013582, 1998). The present study revisited this difference between Mandarin speaking adults and children by applying a newly designed task that tested the use of prosodic information to identify the sentence focus. No evidence was obtained that Mandarin-speaking children (as young as 3 years of age) adhered more strongly to prosodic information than adults but that word order was the strongest cue for their focus interpretation. Our findings support the view that children attune to the specific means of information structure marking in their ambient language at an early age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Focus", "Information structure", "Language acquisition", "Mandarin Chinese", "Prosody"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child, Preschool", "Comprehension", "Humans", "Language Development", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Psycholinguistics", "Speech", "Speech Perception", "Taiwan", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045273118", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57201552207": {"Name": "Chen H.C.", "AuthorID": "57201552207", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60187518", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders, Macquarie University"}, "55926508200": {"Name": "H\u00f6hle B.", "AuthorID": "55926508200", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, University of Potsdam"}, "7007177011": {"Name": "Crain S.", "AuthorID": "7007177011", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University"}, "57206181960": {"Name": "Szendr\u0151i K.", "AuthorID": "57206181960", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Research Department of Linguistics, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
