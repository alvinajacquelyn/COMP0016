The extent of the contribution of isotopic fractionation to these variations is, to date, unknown. In this paper, we present a theoretical chemical study of nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies in order to determine the physical conditions that may lead to a spread of the 14N/15N ratio from the solar value of ~440 and hence evaluate the contribution of chemical reactions in the interstellar medium (ISM) to nitrogen fractionation. We find that the main cause of ISM enrichment of nitrogen fractionation is high gas densities, aided by high fluxes of cosmic rays.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: ISM", "ISM: abundances", "ISM: molecules"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067953355", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7003564783": {"Name": "Viti S.", "AuthorID": "7003564783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8866110100": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Serra I.", "AuthorID": "8866110100", "AffiliationID": "60028677", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda (CSIC/INTA)"}, "57140841200": {"Name": "Holdship J.", "AuthorID": "57140841200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8297809500": {"Name": "Fontani F.", "AuthorID": "8297809500", "AffiliationID": "60021729", "AffiliationName": "Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri"}}}
