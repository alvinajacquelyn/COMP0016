In contrast with pre-existing chromophore reconstruction methods, this approach does not require prior knowledge of the characteristic spectra of the absorbers, which is not always available. Numerical experiments performed on anatomically realistic 3D phantoms show that this approach allows for improved recovery of both the optical absorption and scattering with respect to reconstruction-only methods, and accurate classification of chromophores of clinical interest.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chromophores", "image reconstruction", "Quantitative photoacoustic tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption and scatterings", "Classification methods", "Multi-spectral", "Numerical experiments", "Optical energy", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Prior knowledge", "Reconstruction method"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975048542", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56038057300": {"Name": "Malone E.", "AuthorID": "56038057300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}}}
