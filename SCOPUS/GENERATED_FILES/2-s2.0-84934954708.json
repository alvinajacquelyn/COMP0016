The main novelty of this work is the simultaneous management of energy production and energy demand within a reactive scheduling approach to deal with the presence of uncertainty associated to production and consumption. Delays in the nominal energy demands are allowed under associated penalty costs to tackle flexible and fluctuating demand profiles. In this study, the basic microgrid structure consists of renewable energy systems (photovoltaic panels, wind turbines) and energy storage units. Consequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is presented and used within a rolling horizon scheme that periodically updates input data information.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Demand side management", "Energy planning", "Mathematical programming", "Microgrid", "Rolling horizon", "Scheduling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Demand side managements", "Energy planning", "Micro grid", "Mixed-integer linear programming", "Optimization-based scheduling", "Production and consumption", "Rolling horizon", "Rolling horizon optimization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934954708", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55263577300": {"Name": "Silvente J.", "AuthorID": "55263577300", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, ETSEIB, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "56866527000": {"Name": "Espu\u00f1a A.", "AuthorID": "56866527000", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, ETSEIB, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "25029407700": {"Name": "Kopanos G.", "AuthorID": "25029407700", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University, School of Energy, Environment and Agrifood"}, "35589250700": {"Name": "Pistikopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "35589250700", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Texas A andM University, Department of Chemical Engineering"}}}
