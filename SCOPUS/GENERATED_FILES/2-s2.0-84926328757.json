Here, we describe a human condition associated with a rare variant in SYT1. The individual harboring this variant presented with an early onset dyskinetic movement disorder, severe motor delay, and profound cognitive impairment. Structural MRI was normal, but EEG showed extensive neurophysiological disturbances that included the unusual features of low-frequency oscillatory bursts and enhanced paired-pulse depression of visual evoked potentials. Trio analysis of whole-exome sequence identified a de novo SYT1 missense variant (I368T). Expression of rat SYT1 containing the equivalent human variant in WT mouse primary hippocampal cultures revealed that the mutant form of SYT1 correctly localizes to nerve terminals and is expressed at levels that are approximately equal to levels of endogenous WT protein. The presence of the mutant SYT1 slowed synaptic vesicle fusion kinetics, a finding that agrees with the previously demonstrated role for I368 in calciumdependent membrane penetration. Expression of the I368T variant also altered the kinetics of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Together, the clinical features, electrophysiological phenotype, and in vitro neuronal phenotype associated with this dominant negative SYT1 mutation highlight presynaptic mechanisms that mediate human motor control and cognitive development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Calcium", "Cells, Cultured", "Child", "Endocytosis", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Exocytosis", "Genes, Dominant", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Kinetics", "Male", "Membrane Fusion", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Motor Skills Disorders", "Movement Disorders", "Mutation, Missense", "Point Mutation", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Rats", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Synaptic Vesicles", "Synaptotagmin I"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926328757", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57218323619": {"Name": "Baker K.", "AuthorID": "57218323619", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "8609308100": {"Name": "Grozeva D.", "AuthorID": "8609308100", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "55628590611": {"Name": "Roberts N.Y.", "AuthorID": "55628590611", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57216044821": {"Name": "Raymond F.L.", "AuthorID": "57216044821", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "14035388200": {"Name": "Gordon S.L.", "AuthorID": "14035388200", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh, School of Biomedical Sciences"}, "36793903600": {"Name": "Cousin M.A.", "AuthorID": "36793903600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh, School of Biomedical Sciences"}, "16644282200": {"Name": "Van Kogelenberg M.", "AuthorID": "16644282200", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "6603410789": {"Name": "Hurles M.E.", "AuthorID": "6603410789", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "7103159685": {"Name": "Pike M.", "AuthorID": "7103159685", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57206675476": {"Name": "Blair E.", "AuthorID": "57206675476", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57203031127": {"Name": "Chong W.K.", "AuthorID": "57203031127", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003274699": {"Name": "Baldeweg T.", "AuthorID": "7003274699", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neuroscience Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26647482400": {"Name": "Kurian M.A.", "AuthorID": "26647482400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201529100": {"Name": "Boyd S.G.", "AuthorID": "7201529100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neuroscience Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
