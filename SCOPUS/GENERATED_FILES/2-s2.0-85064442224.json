Cobalt oxide (CoOx) is a promising cocatalyst to protect photoelectrodes and accelerate the charge transfer. CoOx is earth-abundant and stable in extremely alkaline conditions and shows high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we demonstrate that CoOx directly deposited onto InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well photoanodes exhibits excellent activity and stability in a strong alkaline electrolyte, 1 M NaOH (pH = 13.7), for water oxidation up to 28 h, while a reference sample without the catalyst degraded rapidly in the alkaline electrolyte. Under simulated solar illumination, the CoOx-modified InGaN/GaN quantum well photoanode showed a high photocurrent density of 1.26 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V and an onset potential of -0.03 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cobalt oxides", "indium gallium nitrides", "photoanodes", "photoelectrochemical water splitting", "quantum wells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline electrolytes", "Cobalt oxides", "Indium gallium nitride", "InGaN/GaN quantum well", "Oxygen evolution reaction", "Photo-anodes", "Photoelectrochemical water splitting", "Reversible hydrogen electrodes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064442224", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57202830100": {"Name": "Alqahtani M.", "AuthorID": "57202830100", "AffiliationID": "60033126", "AffiliationName": "King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology"}, "57200279481": {"Name": "Cui F.", "AuthorID": "57200279481", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191159247": {"Name": "Alhassan A.", "AuthorID": "57191159247", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Materials Department, University of California"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57208446407": {"Name": "Benjaber S.", "AuthorID": "57208446407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57194114920": {"Name": "Nakamura S.", "AuthorID": "57194114920", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Materials Department, University of California"}, "55605768488": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "55605768488", "AffiliationID": "60028797, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55684697600": {"Name": "Qin Y.", "AuthorID": "55684697600", "AffiliationID": "60028797, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
