For each macroeconomic index we estimate cutoff points in the surprise component of the announcement that specify the degree the volatility process is affected. This degree is quantified by jumps of unknown size that occur before and at the time of the announcement and then die out exponentially with unknown rate. We make inferences using a population Markov chain Monte Carlo reversible jump algorithm and illustrate our methodology by predicting exchange rates volatility using 15 U.S. macroeconomic announcements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian methods", "Exchange rates", "GARCH models", "Model selection", "Nonlinear time series", "Nonparametric methods", "Population Markov chain Monte Carlo", "Reversible jump", "Thresholds", "Volatility forecasting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929606573", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"37124762000": {"Name": "Petralias A.", "AuthorID": "37124762000", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "6603986931": {"Name": "Dellaportas P.", "AuthorID": "6603986931", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Athens University of Economics and Business"}}}
