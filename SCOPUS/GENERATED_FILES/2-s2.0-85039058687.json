Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of tests in the absence of a gold standard. The main field diagnostic for Schistosoma mansoni infection, Kato-Katz (KK), is not very sensitive at low infection intensities. A point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) test has been shown to be more sensitive than KK. However, CCA can return an ambiguous \u2018trace\u2019 result between \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019, and much debate has focused on interpretation of traces results. Methodology/Principle findings: We show how LCA can be extended to include ambiguous trace results and analyse S. mansoni studies from both C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (CdI) and Uganda. We compare the diagnostic performance of KK and CCA and the observed results by each test to the estimated infection prevalence in the population. Prevalence by KK was higher in CdI (13.4%) than in Uganda (6.1%), but prevalence by CCA was similar between countries, both when trace was assumed to be negative (CCAtn: 11.7% in CdI and 9.7% in Uganda) and positive (CCAtp: 20.1% in CdI and 22.5% in Uganda). The estimated sensitivity of CCA was more consistent between countries than the estimated sensitivity of KK, and estimated infection prevalence did not significantly differ between CdI (20.5%) and Uganda (19.1%). The prevalence by CCA with trace as positive did not differ significantly from estimates of infection prevalence in either country, whereas both KK and CCA with trace as negative significantly underestimated infection prevalence in both countries. Conclusions: Incorporation of ambiguous results into an LCA enables the effect of different treatment thresholds to be directly assessed and is applicable in many fields. Our results showed that CCA with trace as positive most accurately estimated infection prevalence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, Helminth", "Child", "Cote d'Ivoire", "Feces", "Humans", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic", "Reference Standards", "Schistosoma mansoni", "Schistosomiasis mansoni", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039058687", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191919450": {"Name": "Clements M.", "AuthorID": "57191919450", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "7004545601": {"Name": "Fenwick A.", "AuthorID": "7004545601", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "15846467900": {"Name": "Knowles S.", "AuthorID": "15846467900", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane"}, "57200068252": {"Name": "Nalule Y.", "AuthorID": "57200068252", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "36553081100": {"Name": "Nogaro S.", "AuthorID": "36553081100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "55433761700": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "55433761700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "14022675800": {"Name": "Fleming F.", "AuthorID": "14022675800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "35468127900": {"Name": "Donnelly C.", "AuthorID": "35468127900", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "6701443866": {"Name": "Kabatereine N.", "AuthorID": "6701443866", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College"}, "55043079100": {"Name": "Meit\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "55043079100", "AffiliationID": "119958153", "AffiliationName": "C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Ministry of Health, National Program Against Filariasis, Schistosomiasis and Geohelminths"}, "7003451565": {"Name": "N'Goran E.", "AuthorID": "7003451565", "AffiliationID": "60071952", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de Formation et de Recherche Biosciences, Universit\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny"}, "6603191182": {"Name": "Tukahebwa E.", "AuthorID": "6603191182", "AffiliationID": "60071670", "AffiliationName": "Vector Control Division, Ministry of Health Uganda"}}}
