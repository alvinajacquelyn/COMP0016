Failure of subsea pipelines can cause serious problems, including oil/gas spill, hydrocarbon explosion and fires, production downtime, and maintenance and repair. Hence, it is of paramount importance to prevent failure of subsea pipelines. The aim of the present study is to investigate the residual strength characteristics of corroded subsea pipelines under combined internal pressure and bending moment. ANSYS non-linear finite element method was applied to examine the residual strength characteristics of subsea pipelines by varying the corrosion damage and the loading ratio of internal pressure and bending moment, where the size of the corrosion damage was also varied. The ultimate strength interaction relationships of subsea pipelines between the internal pressure and bending moment with various corrosion damages were also developed. Finally, the insights and conclusions of the present study were summarised.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bending moment", "burst pressure", "corrosion", "subsea pipelines"], "IndexKeywords": ["Burst pressures", "Harsh environment", "Interaction relationship", "Nonlinear finite element method", "Oil and gas production", "Residual strength", "Sub-sea pipelines", "Ultimate strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941169983", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57214933440": {"Name": "Mohd M.H.", "AuthorID": "57214933440", "AffiliationID": "60078085", "AffiliationName": "Maritime Technology Department, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu"}, "56017446500": {"Name": "Lee B.J.", "AuthorID": "56017446500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine, Engineering Co., Ltd."}, "56734003800": {"Name": "Cui Y.", "AuthorID": "56734003800", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
