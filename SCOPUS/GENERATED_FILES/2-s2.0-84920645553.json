Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["discrete spatial choice", "offender mobility", "replication", "residential burglary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920645553", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"]], "AuthorData": {"7006297377": {"Name": "Townsley M.", "AuthorID": "7006297377", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Griffith University"}, "24536924500": {"Name": "Birks D.", "AuthorID": "24536924500", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence in Policing and Security, Griffith University"}, "6602916901": {"Name": "Bernasco W.", "AuthorID": "6602916901", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Spatial Economics, VU University"}, "13906330600": {"Name": "Ruiter S.", "AuthorID": "13906330600", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Utrecht University"}, "8894355600": {"Name": "Johnson S.D.", "AuthorID": "8894355600", "AffiliationID": "60176024, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "36148835200": {"Name": "White G.", "AuthorID": "36148835200", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Queensland University of Technology"}, "57203071093": {"Name": "Baum S.", "AuthorID": "57203071093", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Urban Research Program, Griffith University"}}}
