We generalize the definition of a cosmic shear tomographic bin to be a set of commonly labeled voxels in photometric color space; rather than bins defined directly in redshift. We explore this approach by using a self-organizing map to define the multidimensional color space, and a we define a \"label space\" of connected regions on the self-organizing map using overlapping elliptical disks. This allows us to then find optimal labeling schemes by searching the label space. We use a metric that is the signal-to-noise ratio of a dark energy equation of state measurement, and in this case we find that for up to five tomographic bins the optimal color-space labeling is an approximation of an equally spaced binning in redshift; that is in all cases the best configuration. We also show that such a redefinition is more robust to photometric redshift outliers than a standard tomographic bin selection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064040134", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"8899520500": {"Name": "Kitching T.D.", "AuthorID": "8899520500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57201992390": {"Name": "Taylor P.L.", "AuthorID": "57201992390", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "14919181700": {"Name": "Capak P.", "AuthorID": "14919181700", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, MC 249- 17"}, "37115881200": {"Name": "Masters D.", "AuthorID": "37115881200", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "7102513091": {"Name": "Hoekstra H.", "AuthorID": "7102513091", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}}}
