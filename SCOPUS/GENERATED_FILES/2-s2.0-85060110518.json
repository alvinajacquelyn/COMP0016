MR can be performed using either a whole-hand or a digital approach. MR should be formally taught and trainees should be assessed for competence, and later, performance should ideally be tracked with statistical control charts. There is paucity of robust evidence evaluating MR relative to the other methods of rotational OVD: rotational forceps (RF) and rotational ventouse (RV). Furthermore, there is little evidence concerning long-term maternal outcomes of rotational OVD. A prospective randomised trial of MR versus either RF or RV is clearly needed, along with a core outcome set for OVD to facilitate comprehensive evaluation programmes that focus on aspects pertaining to women.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Birth", "Manual rotation", "Rotational birth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery, Obstetric", "Female", "Humans", "Nurse Midwives", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pregnancy", "Version, Fetal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060110518", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57192808374": {"Name": "O'Brien S.", "AuthorID": "57192808374", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Women's Health, The Chilterns, Southmead Hospital"}, "12040807900": {"Name": "Siassakos D.", "AuthorID": "12040807900", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Women's Health, The Chilterns, Southmead Hospital"}, "57205454722": {"Name": "Jordan S.", "AuthorID": "57205454722", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Women's Health, The Chilterns, Southmead Hospital"}}}
