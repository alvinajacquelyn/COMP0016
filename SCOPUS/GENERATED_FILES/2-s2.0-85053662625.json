The placenta may suffer from several pathologies, which affect this fetal-maternal exchange, thus the flow properties of the placenta are of interest in determining the course of pregnancy. In this work, we propose a new multiparametric model for placental tissue signal in MRI. Methods: We describe a method that separates fetal and maternal flow characteristics of the placenta using a 3-compartment model comprising fast and slowly circulating fluid pools, and a tissue pool is fitted to overlapping multiecho T2 relaxometry and diffusion MRI with low b-values. We implemented the combined model and acquisition on a standard 1.5 Tesla clinical system with acquisition taking less than 20 minutes. Results: We apply this combined acquisition in 6 control singleton placentas. Mean myometrial T2 relaxation time was 123.63 (\u00b16.71) ms. Mean T2 relaxation time of maternal blood was 202.17 (\u00b192.98) ms. In the placenta, mean T2 relaxation time of the fetal blood component was 144.89 (\u00b154.42) ms. Mean ratio of maternal to fetal blood volume was 1.16 (\u00b10.6), and mean fetal blood saturation was 72.93 (\u00b120.11)% across all 6 cases. Conclusion: The novel acquisition in this work allows the measurement of histologically relevant physical parameters, such as the relative proportions of vascular spaces. In the placenta, this may help us to better understand the physiological properties of the tissue in disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chorion", "DECIDE", "diffusion", "flow-matching", "relaxometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["chorion", "Circulating fluids", "DECIDE", "Flow charac-teristics", "Flow matching", "Physical parameters", "Physiological properties", "Relaxometry", "Algorithms", "Female", "Fetal Blood", "Fetus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Maternal-Fetal Exchange", "Models, Theoretical", "Myometrium", "Oxygen", "Placenta", "Placental Circulation", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Umbilical Arteries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053662625", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"22980645100": {"Name": "Melbourne A.", "AuthorID": "22980645100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging, Kings College London"}, "57203243221": {"Name": "Aughwane R.", "AuthorID": "57203243221", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College Hospital,London"}, "57020797300": {"Name": "Owen D.", "AuthorID": "57020797300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging, Kings College London"}, "56850472300": {"Name": "Flouri D.", "AuthorID": "56850472300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging, Kings College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging, Kings College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging, Kings College London"}, "7006008708": {"Name": "Kendall G.", "AuthorID": "7006008708", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College Hospital,London"}, "55981137300": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "55981137300", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital KU Leuven"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "55220094000": {"Name": "Sokolska M.", "AuthorID": "55220094000", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, University College Hospital"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, University College Hospital"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
