British Journal of Pharmacology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The British Pharmacological Society.The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2015/16 provides concise overviews of the key properties of over 1750 human drug targets with their pharmacology, plus links to an open access knowledgebase of drug targets and their ligands (www.guidetopharmacology.org), which provides more detailed views of target and ligand properties. The full contents can be found at http://onlinelibrary.Wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.13349/full. Ligand-gated ion channels are one of the eight major pharmacological targets into which the Guide is divided, with the others being: ligand-gated ion channels, voltage-gated ion channels, other ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors, enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The Concise Guide is published in landscape format in order to facilitate comparison of related targets. It is a condensed version of material contemporary to late 2015, which is presented in greater detail and constantly updated on the website www.guidetopharmacology.org, superseding data presented in the previous Guides to Receptors & Channels and the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2013/14. It is produced in conjunction with NC-IUPHAR and provides the official IUPHAR classification and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate. It consolidates information previously curated and displayed separately in IUPHAR-DB and GRAC and provides a permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Databases, Pharmaceutical", "Humans", "Ligand-Gated Ion Channels", "Ligands"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949894991", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"10539802900": {"Name": "Alexander S.P.H.", "AuthorID": "10539802900", "AffiliationID": "60099153", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham Medical School"}, "7404190088": {"Name": "Peters J.A.", "AuthorID": "7404190088", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Division, Medical Education Institute, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee"}, "16151065100": {"Name": "Kelly E.", "AuthorID": "16151065100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "7003995580": {"Name": "Marrion N.", "AuthorID": "7003995580", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "55372086400": {"Name": "Benson H.E.", "AuthorID": "55372086400", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "6507010871": {"Name": "Faccenda E.", "AuthorID": "6507010871", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "6602157478": {"Name": "Pawson A.J.", "AuthorID": "6602157478", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "18038776000": {"Name": "Sharman J.L.", "AuthorID": "18038776000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004000701": {"Name": "Southan C.", "AuthorID": "7004000701", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7404983017": {"Name": "Davies J.A.", "AuthorID": "7404983017", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}}}
