Although they all convey the same intuitive idea of giving a \u201cdimension\u201d to sets where a quantity scales similarly within a space, they are not necessarily equivalent on a more rigorous level. This review article aims at unifying the multifractal methodology by presenting the multifractal theoretical framework and principal practical methods, namely the moment method, the histogram method, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) and wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM), with a comparative and interpretative eye.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multifractal analysis", "Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis", "Multifractal histogram method", "Multifractal modulus maxima wavelet transform method", "Multifractal moment method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Histogram method", "Modulus maxima", "Multi fractals", "Multifractal analysis", "Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009987890", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"37066522800": {"Name": "Salat H.", "AuthorID": "37066522800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "24066273900": {"Name": "Arcaute E.", "AuthorID": "24066273900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "56013716500": {"Name": "Murcio R.", "AuthorID": "56013716500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175902", "AffiliationName": "Consumer Research Data Centre, University College London"}}}
