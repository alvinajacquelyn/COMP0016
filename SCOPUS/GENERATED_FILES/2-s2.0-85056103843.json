Our primary outcome was to measure the prevalence of MSK symptoms in PLWH in urban West Africa. Our secondary outcomes were to describe the disability, impact on work and treatment use associated with the presence of MSK pain. We conducted an e-questionnaire-based point prevalence study of musculoskeletal symptoms, associated disability and treatment in 292 PLWH attending routine follow-up in Lagos, Nigeria. Seventy-three (25%) patients reported MSK pain; 28 (38%) reported chronic symptoms (> 3 months). HIV suppression rates were high in this population (n = 240, 82%) and comparable between individuals with and without chronic pain. MSK pain was associated with female gender and higher body mass index (BMI). Mechanical pain was the most common pain syndrome identified (n = 34, 47%). Lumbar spine and knee were the most common sites. Chronic pain was associated with increased disability compared with the presence of any MSK pain. High rates of treatment-seeking behaviour were seen in those individuals reporting MSK pain (n = 62, 85%). The majority of these individuals sought traditional treatments (n = 48, 66%). Chronic MSK pain and non-prescribed treatments are common in PLWH established on ART in urban West Africa. Studies are required to measure the long-term impact of these symptoms and medicines on retention in HIV care and ART adherence, besides other long-term health outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "HIV", "Musculoskeletal disease", "Pain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Africa, Western", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Chronic Pain", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Musculoskeletal Pain", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Urban Population", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056103843", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55566896000": {"Name": "Fink D.", "AuthorID": "55566896000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Immunity, Cruciform Building, University College London"}, "36114684500": {"Name": "Oladele D.", "AuthorID": "36114684500", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "57190295499": {"Name": "Wapmuk A.", "AuthorID": "57190295499", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "57204554303": {"Name": "Musari-Martins T.", "AuthorID": "57204554303", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "56711259400": {"Name": "Agahowa E.", "AuthorID": "56711259400", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "55352374000": {"Name": "Ekama S.", "AuthorID": "55352374000", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "57204555516": {"Name": "Okechukwu A.", "AuthorID": "57204555516", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "6603729091": {"Name": "Ezechi O.", "AuthorID": "6603729091", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "57214702906": {"Name": "Salako B.", "AuthorID": "57214702906", "AffiliationID": "60089405", "AffiliationName": "Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR)"}, "56607396300": {"Name": "Etomi O.", "AuthorID": "56607396300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of maternal medicine, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8722893400": {"Name": "Mallen C.", "AuthorID": "8722893400", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Keele University"}}}
