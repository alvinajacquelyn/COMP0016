In addition, we have employed a range of many-body methods; including G0W0, qsGW, EA/IP-EOM-CCSD, and DFT (B3LYP, PBE), to compare the performance and predictions of the different classes of methods. We demonstrate that, for bare clusters, all many-body methods predict the same trend with cluster size. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied DFT orbitals follow the same trends as the electron affinity and ionization potentials predicted by the many-body methods, but are generally far too shallow and deep respectively in absolute terms. In contrast, the \u0394DFT method is found to yield values in the correct energy window. However, its predictions depend upon the functional used and do not necessarily follow trends based on the many-body methods. Adiabatic potentials are predicted to be similar to their vertical counterparts and holes found to be trapped more strongly than excess electrons. The effect of hydroxylation on the clusters is to open up both the optical and fundamental gap. Finally, a simple microscopic explanation for the observed trends with cluster size and upon hydroxylation is proposed in terms of the onsite electrostatic potential.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027000809", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55697801800": {"Name": "Berardo E.", "AuthorID": "55697801800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56957845300": {"Name": "Kaplan F.", "AuthorID": "56957845300", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Campus North"}, "25822426700": {"Name": "Bhaskaran-Nair K.", "AuthorID": "25822426700", "AffiliationID": "60019488, 60007566", "AffiliationName": "Cain Department of Chemical Engineering, Louisiana State University"}, "12802839400": {"Name": "Shelton W.", "AuthorID": "12802839400", "AffiliationID": "60019488, 60007566", "AffiliationName": "Cain Department of Chemical Engineering, Louisiana State University"}, "20434946000": {"Name": "Van Setten M.", "AuthorID": "20434946000", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscopic Physics, Institute of Condensed Matter and Nanosciences, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "7103026909": {"Name": "Kowalski K.", "AuthorID": "7103026909", "AffiliationID": "60015103, 60026097, 60023471", "AffiliationName": "William R.
