It is known that strong social networks facilitate access to psychosocial resources that help people reduce and manage stress. However, little is known about the social networks of same-sex couples, in particular their connections to other same-sex couples, which is important to understand given that the presence of similar others in social networks can ameliorate social stress for stigmatized populations. In this brief report, we present data from a diverse sample of 120 same-sex couples in Atlanta and San Francisco. The median number of other same-sex couples known was 12; couples where one partner was non-Hispanic White and the other a person of color knew relatively few other same-sex couples; and there was a high degree of homophily within the social networks of same-sex couples. These data establish a useful starting point for future investigations of couples\u2019 social networks, especially couples whose relationships are stigmatized or marginalized in some way. Better understandings of the size, composition, and functions of same-sex couples\u2019 social networks are critically needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bisexual", "gay", "lesbian", "same-sex couples", "similar others", "social networks", "social support"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community Networks", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Sexual Minorities", "Sexual Partners", "Social Support", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942194143", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7103232966": {"Name": "LeBlanc A.", "AuthorID": "7103232966", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Health Equity Institute, Department of Sociology, San Francisco State University"}, "12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population and Family Health, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}, "56514168100": {"Name": "Alston-Stepnitz E.", "AuthorID": "56514168100", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of California"}, "57195541085": {"Name": "Bauermeister J.", "AuthorID": "57195541085", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, School of Public Heath, University of Michigan"}, "35514376200": {"Name": "Stephenson R.", "AuthorID": "35514376200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Health Behavior and Biological Sciences, School of Nursing and The Center for Sexuality and Health Disparities, University of Michigan"}, "55207169900": {"Name": "Woodyatt C.", "AuthorID": "55207169900", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Emory University"}, "7101750026": {"Name": "de Vries B.", "AuthorID": "7101750026", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Work and Gerontology, San Francisco State University"}}}
