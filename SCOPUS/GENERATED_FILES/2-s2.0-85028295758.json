In this paper, we report improved environmental stability of ZnO film-based planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells, by suppressing photocatalytic activities induced by the ZnO electron transfer layer. The photovoltaic performance and stability in an ambient environment under continuous illumination are effectively improved by applying an aluminum oxide interlayer on the ZnO film to suppress the photocatalytic degradation of perovskites. The highest efficiency of solar cells has increased from 14.62% to 17.17%, and after 250 h of continuous exposure under full spectrum simulated sunlight in air, the efficiency remains as high as 15.03%. The results suggest that effective suppression of photocatalytic degradation of perovskites with a modified electron transfer layer is a new solution to improve the long-term environmental stability of perovskite solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Effective suppression", "Environmental instability", "Environmental stability", "Photo catalytic degradation", "Photocatalytic activities", "Photocatalytic decomposition", "Photocatalytic effect", "Photovoltaic performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028295758", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57192198429": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57192198429", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36538012200": {"Name": "Sarvari H.", "AuthorID": "36538012200", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky"}}}
