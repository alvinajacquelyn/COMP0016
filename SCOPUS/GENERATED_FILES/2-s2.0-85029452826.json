Neither of these two errors affects the conclusions in any way. The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused. First, when combining the data from the four different conditions we overlooked that some participants had the same participant id. This led us to erroneously reduce our sample size in several cases by treating data from different participants as coming from the same participant. This error affected all results reported in the paper. All tests are in fact more powerful than reported. After correcting this error (updated manuscripts and analyses scripts are available at: https://osf.io/j4swp/) the pattern of significant and non-significant results remained the same with two exceptions. The two exceptions were the follow-up analyses of the relevance by conditional probability interaction for indicatives. The difference between NE and IR at the midpoint and far right end of the scale was now significant, both p = 0.049. In all other cases the pattern stayed the same and the correct p-values were mostly somewhat smaller than reported. In addition, the degrees of freedom reported throughout are too low, but the effect of this on reported parameter estimates is small. Second, instead of a reduced sample of 495 participants we used all 725 participants for our analyses of the pretest (as reported in the supplemental materials). For the full 725 participants the average Delta-p was 0.32 for the positive relevance conditions, \u22120.27 for the negative relevance conditions, and \u22120.01 for our irrelevance conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029452826", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56734446400": {"Name": "Skovgaard-Olsen N.", "AuthorID": "56734446400", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "7006445400": {"Name": "Klauer K.", "AuthorID": "7006445400", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Z\u00fcrich"}}}
