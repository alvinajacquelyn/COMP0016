However, the reliability of these tests has been much criticised and they may mislead. It is now widely accepted that pyuria (\u22651 WBC \u03bcl\u22121) detected by microscopy of a fresh unspun, unstained specimen of urine is the best biological indicator of UTI available. We aimed to scrutinise the greater potential of symptoms analysis in detecting pyuria and UTI. Methods: Lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) descriptions were collected from patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms referred to a tertiary referral unit. The symptoms informed a 39-question inventory, grouped into storage, voiding, stress incontinence and pain symptoms. All questions sought a binary yes or no response. A bespoke software package was developed to collect the data. The study was powered to a sample of at least 1,990 patients, with sufficient power to analyse 39 symptoms in a linear model with an effect size of Cohen\u2019s f2 = 0.02, type 1 error probability = 0.05; and power (1-\u03b2); 95% where \u03b2 is the probability of type 2 error). The inventory was administered to 2,050 female patients between August 2004 and November 2011. The data were collated and the following properties assessed: internal consistency, test\u2013retest reliability, inter-observer reliability, internal responsiveness, external responsiveness, construct validity analysis and a comparison with the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire for female lower urinary tract symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS). The dependent variable used as a surrogate marker of UTI was microscopic pyuria. An MSU sample was sent for routine culture. Results: The symptoms proved reliable predictors of microscopic pyuria. In particular, voiding symptoms correlated well with microscopic pyuria (\u03c72 = 88, df = 1, p < 0.001). The symptom inventory has significant psychometric characteristics as below: test\u2013retest reliability: Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.981; inter-observer reliability, Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.995, internal responsiveness F = 221, p < 0.001, external responsiveness F = 359, df = 5, p < 0.001. The correlation coefficients for the domains of the ICIQ-FLUTS were around R = 0.5, p < 0.001. Conclusion: This symptoms score performed well on the standard, psychometric validation. The score changed in response to treatment and in a direction appropriate to the changes in microscopic pyuria. It correlated with measures of quality of life. It would seem to make a good candidate for monitoring treatment progress in ordinary clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lower urinary tract symptoms", "Microscopy", "Pyuria", "Urinary tract infection", "Validated symptom score"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Infections", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Psychometrics", "Pyuria", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030214237", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"23392797800": {"Name": "Khasriya R.", "AuthorID": "23392797800", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Hornsey Central Neighbourhood Health Centre"}, "57195935257": {"Name": "Swamy S.", "AuthorID": "57195935257", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Hornsey Central Neighbourhood Health Centre"}, "56611436400": {"Name": "Gill K.", "AuthorID": "56611436400", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Hornsey Central Neighbourhood Health Centre"}, "55547210700": {"Name": "Kupelian A.", "AuthorID": "55547210700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Hornsey Central Neighbourhood Health Centre"}, "7003536229": {"Name": "Malone-Lee J.", "AuthorID": "7003536229", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Hornsey Central Neighbourhood Health Centre"}, "56768040900": {"Name": "Barcella W.", "AuthorID": "56768040900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "54790582600": {"Name": "De Iorio M.", "AuthorID": "54790582600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
