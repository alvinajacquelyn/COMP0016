Methods: Ninty-nine consecutive patients with urodynamically proven idiopathic detrusor overactivity (IDO) refractory to medical treatment and opting for Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS), were assessed pre and post FSTLP. Data from 3-day frequency-volume charts, and patient reported (subjective) outcomes were used to assess success or failure after FSTLP. Success was defined as improvement in symptoms >50%. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain whether key parameters at filling cystometrogram were predictors for success prior to FSTLP. Results: Binary logistic regression analysis did not demonstrate any significant relationship between the five parameters at urodynamics and outcome at FSTLP (B < 0.01, P > 0.16) for all parameters. Conclusions: The results from this prospective analysis on patients with IDO refractive to medical therapy referred for SNS would suggest that aside from proving DO at urodynamics as a pre-requisite for intervention as per NICE and EAU guidelines, no parameter is predictive for a successful outcome at FSTLP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FSTLP", "nerve evaluation", "outcome", "overactive bladder", "parameters", "predictive", "sacral neuromodulation", "success", "urodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Sacrum", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder, Overactive", "Urodynamics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045266942", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57201550974": {"Name": "Nobrega R.P.", "AuthorID": "57201550974", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Speciality Registrar in Urological Surgery, Oxford Deanery/Clinical Research Fellow in Urodynamics at University College Hospital"}, "57190621213": {"Name": "Solomon E.", "AuthorID": "57190621213", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "56487346000": {"Name": "Jenks J.", "AuthorID": "56487346000", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Nurse Specialist, University College Hospital"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Urological Surgeon, University College Hospital"}, "6506281538": {"Name": "Ockrim J.", "AuthorID": "6506281538", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Urological Surgeon, University College Hospital"}}}
