Methods: The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-12) was used in a cross-sectional survey to elicit service user reports of anticipated and experienced discrimination by 150 people with a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia and 176 with a diagnosis of first-episode major depressive disorder in seven countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Sweden and Turkey). Results: Participants with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder reported discrimination in a greater number of life areas than those with schizophrenia, as rated by the total DISC-12 score (p = .03). With regard to specific life areas, participants with depression reported more discrimination in regard to neighbours, dating, education, marriage, religious activities, physical health and acting as a parent than participants with schizophrenia. Participants with schizophrenia reported more discrimination with regard to the police compared to participants with depression. Conclusion: Stigma and discrimination because of mental illness change in the course of the mental diseases. Future research may take a longitudinal perspective to better understand the beginnings of stigmatisation and its trajectory through the life course and to identify critical periods at which anti-stigma interventions can most effectively be applied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["depression", "discrimination", "first episode", "schizophrenia", "Stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Austria", "Croatia", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Czech Republic", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Discrimination (Psychology)", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Mental Health", "Poland", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Romania", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Social Stigma", "Sweden", "Turkey"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937899000", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6602695193": {"Name": "Corker E.", "AuthorID": "6602695193", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "7005922805": {"Name": "Thornicroft G.", "AuthorID": "7005922805", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "55343358100": {"Name": "Beldie A.", "AuthorID": "55343358100", "AffiliationID": "60091034", "AffiliationName": "Al.
