These behave superdimensionally, exhibiting a higher local density of resonant frequencies, giant focusing of rays, and stronger concentration of waves than expected from the physical dimension. This sub-Riemannian optics allows planar designs to function effectively as 3- or higher-dimensional media, and bulk material as dimension 4 or higher. Valid for any waves modeled by the Helmholtz equation, including scalar optics and acoustics, and with properties derived from the behavior of waves in sub-Riemannian geometry, these arrays can be assembled from nonresonant metamaterial cells and are potentially broadband. Possible applications include antenna design and energy harvesting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metamaterials", "Sub-Riemannian geometry", "Transformation optics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna design", "Bulk materials", "Higher-dimensional", "Local density", "Physical dimensions", "Sub-riemannian", "Sub-Riemannian geometry", "Transformation optics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043753188", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7005866393": {"Name": "Greenleaf A.", "AuthorID": "7005866393", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Rochester"}, "20734383700": {"Name": "Kettunen H.", "AuthorID": "20734383700", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Helsinki"}, "6604064173": {"Name": "Lassas M.", "AuthorID": "6604064173", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Helsinki"}, "6602606312": {"Name": "Kurylev Y.", "AuthorID": "6602606312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University College London"}, "7004576662": {"Name": "Uhlmann G.", "AuthorID": "7004576662", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Washington"}}}
