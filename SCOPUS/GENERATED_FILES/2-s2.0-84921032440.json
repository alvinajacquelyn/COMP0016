Objectives: The current paper presented two consensus methods, not commonly used in consultation with service users, to develop a peer support intervention for family carers of people with dementia (SHIELD Carer Supporter Programme). Design: Study 1 was a modified Delphi process combined with a consensus conference to explore details of the intervention from the carer and volunteer perspective. Study 2 was an anonymous reader consultation to develop informed consent documents for the intervention trial. Median scores were used to measure and establish consensus. Open-ended responses were thematically analysed. Setting and participants: Study 1: twenty-five delegates participated (eight were current/former carers) in the first round Delphi questionnaire, with 21 attending the conference. Five completed the Round 2 questionnaire. Study 2: six family carers and 11 people with dementia took part in the consultation. Results: Study 1: the role of the peer supporters was developed in terms of relational and practical aspects of the intervention. Study 2: changes were made to the documents, reflecting service user input, but the effectiveness of this less discursive type of service user involvement was unclear. Discussion and conclusions: Study 1 methods allowed for service users to contribute significantly and meaningfully, but maybe limiting some design innovation. Study 2 took a more traditional and less collaborative approach. This has implications for balancing the needs of the research with meaningful service user involvement in research. copy; 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carer", "Consultation methods", "Delphi methods", "Dementia", "Informed consent consultation", "Service user involvement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Consensus Development Conferences as Topic", "Delphi Technique", "Dementia", "Family", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Informed Consent", "Interprofessional Relations", "Pamphlets", "Peer Group", "Program Development", "Social Support", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Volunteers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921032440", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14031205100": {"Name": "Burnell K.J.", "AuthorID": "14031205100", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences and Social Work, University of Portsmouth"}, "55898243300": {"Name": "Selwood A.", "AuthorID": "55898243300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Mental Health Sciences, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57162197100": {"Name": "Sullivan T.", "AuthorID": "57162197100", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.M.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Allied Health Professions, University of East Anglia"}}}
