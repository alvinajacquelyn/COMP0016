A case of a 15-year-old boy is reported who presented with severe systemic inflammation, perimyocarditis and cardiogenic shock, in whom EGPA was initially suspected and later diagnosed with autoimmune adrenalitis with PGA. The severity of the systemic inflammation and perimyocarditis suggests a more widespread autoimmune-mediated process. Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency should be considered in all cases of pericarditis and perimyocarditis, especially when the severity of clinical manifestations exceeds the expected for the severity of the cardiac findings, as timely identification and prompt treatment may be life-saving.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Addison's disease", "eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis", "polyglandular autoimmune syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Addison Disease", "Adolescent", "Humans", "Male", "Myocarditis", "Pericarditis", "Pericardium", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039061181", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57194755732": {"Name": "Lamback E.B.", "AuthorID": "57194755732", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine and Endocrine Unit, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "53984839900": {"Name": "Morandi G.", "AuthorID": "53984839900", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Section, University of Verona"}, "57117949500": {"Name": "Rapti E.", "AuthorID": "57117949500", "AffiliationID": "60026834", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology Section, AHEPA Hospital"}, "55963563800": {"Name": "Christov G.", "AuthorID": "55963563800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Infection Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203616076": {"Name": "Hindmarsh P.", "AuthorID": "57203616076", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
