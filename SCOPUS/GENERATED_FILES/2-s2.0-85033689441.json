In Saccharomyces hybrids, chromosomal missegregation during meiosis I produces gametes with missing or extra chromosomes. Gametes with missing chromosomes are inviable, but we do not understand how extra chromosomes (disomies) influence hybrid gamete inviability. We designed a model predicting rates of missegregation in interspecific hybrid meioses assuming several different mechanisms of disomy tolerance, and compared predictions from the model with observations of sterility in hybrids between Saccharomyces yeast species. Sterility observations were consistent with the hypothesis that chromosomal missegregation causes hybrid sterility, and the model indicated that missegregation probabilities of 13\u201350% per chromosome can cause observed values of 90\u201399% hybrid sterility regardless of how cells tolerate disomies. Missing chromosomes in gametes are responsible for most infertility, but disomies may kill as many as 11% of the gametes produced by hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus.
