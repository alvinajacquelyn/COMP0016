To this end, four groups first practised a three-segment motor sequence task with different KR protocols. Two experimental groups received reduced-frequency KR, one group received high-frequency KR (feedback available on every trial), and one received no-KR. Compared to the no-KR group, the groups that received KR learned the temporal goal of the movement sequence, as evidenced by increased accuracy and consistency across training. Next, all groups learned a single-segment movement that had the same temporal goal as the motor sequence task but required the imitation of biological and nonbiological motion kinematics. Kinematic data showed that whilst all groups imitated biological motion kinematics, the two experimental reduced-frequency KR groups were on average ~800 ms more accurate at imitating movement time than the high-frequency KR and no-KR groups. The interplay between learning biological motion kinematics and the transfer of temporal representation indicates imitation involves distinct, but complementary lower-level sensorimotor and higher-level cognitive processing systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological motion", "Imitation", "Knowledge-of-results", "Motor training", "Transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Knowledge of Results (Psychology)", "Learning", "Male", "Motor Skills", "Movement", "Random Allocation", "Transfer (Psychology)", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958541008", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"54796378200": {"Name": "Andrew M.", "AuthorID": "54796378200", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "7403105607": {"Name": "Bennett S.", "AuthorID": "7403105607", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "55755568100": {"Name": "Elliott D.", "AuthorID": "55755568100", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University"}, "8629701800": {"Name": "Hayes S.", "AuthorID": "8629701800", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}}}
