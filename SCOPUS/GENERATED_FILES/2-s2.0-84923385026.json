All rights reserved.Orthognathic treatment is a process which involves orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery and is used to treat those dento-facial discrepancies which are outside the scope of conventional orthodontic treatment, for example severe Class II or Class III problems, anterior open bites and facial asymmetries. Patients who present with these severe problems may encounter a wide range of different problems ranging from functional problems (for example, difficulties biting and chewing) to self-consciousness in a wide range of work and social situations. This paper discusses the possible indications for orthognathic treatment and looks at the risks and benefits of treatment. The treatment pathway is also described.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Esthetics, Dental", "Facial Asymmetry", "Humans", "Malocclusion", "Malocclusion, Angle Class II", "Malocclusion, Angle Class III", "Open Bite", "Orthodontics", "Orthognathic Surgical Procedures", "Patient Care Team", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923385026", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Orthodontic Department, University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6603836932": {"Name": "Johal A.", "AuthorID": "6603836932", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Oral Growth and Development (Orthodontics), Institute of Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
