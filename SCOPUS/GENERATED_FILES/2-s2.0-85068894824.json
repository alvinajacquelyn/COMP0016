Compared with birth at full term, extremely preterm birth places infants at increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, intellectual impairments, and psychiatric sequelae that persist throughout childhood and adolescence.1 There is increasing interest in the longer-term outcomes for these babies; in particular, whether adverse outcomes persist or increase in adulthood or whether survivors can outgrow earlier problems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Ireland", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068894824", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7406331158": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331158", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "37026799300": {"Name": "O'Reilly H.", "AuthorID": "37026799300", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "University College Dublin"}, "57208840223": {"Name": "Ni Y.", "AuthorID": "57208840223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003469597": {"Name": "Wolke D.", "AuthorID": "7003469597", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}}}
