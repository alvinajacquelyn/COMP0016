While donor electron spins in silicon provide extremely long coherence times and access to the nuclear spin via the hyperfine interaction, quantum dots have the complementary advantages of fast electrical operations, tunability, and scalability. Here, we present an approach to a novel hybrid double quantum dot by coupling a donor to a lithographically patterned artificial atom. Using gate-based rf reflectometry, we probe the charge stability of this double quantum-dot system and the variation of quantum capacitance at the interdot charge transition. Using microwave spectroscopy, we find a tunnel coupling of 2.7 GHz and characterize the charge dynamics, which reveals a charge T *2of 200 ps and a relaxation time T1 of 100 ns. Additionally, we demonstrate a spin blockade at the inderdot transition, opening up the possibility to operate this coupled system as a singlet-triplet qubit or to transfer a coherent spin state between the quantum dot and the donor electron and nucleus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Condensed matter physics", "Nanophysics", "Quantum physics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coherent spin state", "Double quantum dots", "Electron spin qubits", "Hyperfine interactions", "Microelectronics industry", "Nanophysics", "Quantum capacitance", "Quantum physics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944074695", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36706694100": {"Name": "Urdampilleta M.", "AuthorID": "36706694100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56939762900": {"Name": "Chatterjee A.", "AuthorID": "56939762900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "34869932100": {"Name": "Lo C.C.", "AuthorID": "34869932100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56568373600": {"Name": "Mansir J.", "AuthorID": "56568373600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56824677200": {"Name": "Kobayashi T.", "AuthorID": "56824677200", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}, "6701628868": {"Name": "Rogge S.", "AuthorID": "6701628868", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}, "12143356000": {"Name": "Barraud S.", "AuthorID": "12143356000", "AffiliationID": "60011447, 60007823", "AffiliationName": "CEA, LETI"}, "45561096600": {"Name": "Betz A.C.", "AuthorID": "45561096600", "AffiliationID": "60024923", "AffiliationName": "Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory"}, "55355053900": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Zalba M.F.", "AuthorID": "55355053900", "AffiliationID": "60024923", "AffiliationName": "Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory"}}}
