Here, micron-sized plate-like copper-substituted layered P2-type Na0.67CuxMn1-xO2 is demonstrated to rapidly charge and discharge within 5 minutes while giving a capacity of more than 90 mA h g-1, corresponding to a half-cell energy density of 260 W h (kg cathode)-1 at a power density of 3000 W (kg cathode)-1, which is comparable to that of high-power lithium-ion cathodes. The materials show excellent stability, retaining more than 70% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The good cycle and rate performances of the materials are attributed to copper in the lattice, which stabilizes the crystal structure, increases the average discharge potential and improves sodium transport. This makes Na0.67CuxMn1-xO2 an ideal choice as a cathode for high-power sodium-ion batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cath-ode materials", "Charge and discharge", "Discharge potential", "Lithium-ion cathode", "Power densities", "Rate performance", "Sodium ion batteries", "Sodium transport"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946914113", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"35435141000": {"Name": "Kang W.", "AuthorID": "35435141000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "24822626900": {"Name": "Ng T.", "AuthorID": "24822626900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56193117100": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56193117100", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Functional Thin Films Research Center, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "25823954600": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "25823954600", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Functional Thin Films Research Center, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "12804903900": {"Name": "Wai Yu D.", "AuthorID": "12804903900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56957468500": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "56957468500", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong"}}}
