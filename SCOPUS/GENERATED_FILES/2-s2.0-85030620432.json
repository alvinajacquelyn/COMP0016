All rights reserved.Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is rare in children, and evidence-based guidelines are sparse. Consequently, management is mostly based on observational studies and physician's experience, and treatment regimens differ widely. The Single Hub and Access point for paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) initiative was launched to develop diagnostic and management regimens for children and young adults with rheumatic diseases. Here, we developed evidencebased recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of paediatric APS. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the European League Against Rheumatism standard operating procedure. Following a detailed systematic review of the literature, a committee of paediatric rheumatologists and representation of paediatric haematology with expertise in paediatric APS developed recommendations. The literature review yielded 1473 articles, of which 15 were valid and relevant. In total, four recommendations for diagnosis and eight for treatment of paediatric APS (including paediatric Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome) were accepted. Additionally, two recommendations for children born to mothers with APS were accepted. It was agreed that new classification criteria for paediatric APS are necessary, and APS in association with childhoodonset systemic lupus erythematosus should be identified by performing antiphospholipid antibody screening. Treatment recommendations included prevention of thrombotic events, and treatment recommendations for venous and/or arterial thrombotic events. Notably, due to the paucity of studies on paediatric APS, level of evidence and strength of the recommendations is relatively low. The SHARE initiative provides international, evidencebased recommendations for diagnosis and treatment for paediatric APS, facilitating improvement and uniformity of care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030620432", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56022291100": {"Name": "Groot N.", "AuthorID": "56022291100", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Centre"}, "56612053000": {"Name": "De Graeff N.", "AuthorID": "56612053000", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Paediatric Immunology"}, "6602257801": {"Name": "Van Royen-Kerkhof A.", "AuthorID": "6602257801", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Paediatric Immunology"}, "8600420500": {"Name": "Vastert S.J.", "AuthorID": "8600420500", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Paediatric Immunology"}, "8050234100": {"Name": "Wulffraat N.M.", "AuthorID": "8050234100", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Paediatric Immunology"}, "6603169727": {"Name": "Kamphuis S.", "AuthorID": "6603169727", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Centre"}, "6602605283": {"Name": "Avcin T.", "AuthorID": "6602605283", "AffiliationID": "60073906, 60021479", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre"}, "16038475200": {"Name": "Bader-Meunier B.", "AuthorID": "16038475200", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Necker Hospital, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}, "6603422138": {"Name": "Dolezalova P.", "AuthorID": "6603422138", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "General University Hospital, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "7102905951": {"Name": "Feldman B.", "AuthorID": "7102905951", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7004592355": {"Name": "Kenet G.", "AuthorID": "7004592355", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Israel National Hemophilia Centre, Sackler Medical School, Sheba Medical Centre"}, "56284027300": {"Name": "Kon\u00e9-Paut I.", "AuthorID": "56284027300", "AffiliationID": "60013430", "AffiliationName": "Bic\u00eatre University Hospital"}, "7003352837": {"Name": "Lahdenne P.", "AuthorID": "7003352837", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60021365", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004749677": {"Name": "Pilkington C.A.", "AuthorID": "7004749677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12239170000": {"Name": "McCann L.", "AuthorID": "12239170000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "6603662700": {"Name": "Beresford M.W.", "AuthorID": "6603662700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "7006272421": {"Name": "Ravelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006272421", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Genova, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7005824561": {"Name": "Uziel Y.", "AuthorID": "7005824561", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60022851, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Meir Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University"}, "7103280649": {"Name": "Ozen S.", "AuthorID": "7103280649", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University, Medical Faculty"}}}
