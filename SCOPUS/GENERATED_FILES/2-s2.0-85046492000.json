A pure or nearly pure quantum state can be described as a low-rank density matrix, which is a positive semidefinite and unit-trace Hermitian. We consider the problem of recovering such a low-rank density matrix contaminated by sparse components, from a small set of linear measurements. This quantum state estimation task can be formulated as a robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem subject to positive semidefinite and unit-trace Hermitian constraints. We propose an efficient and fast inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (I-ADMM), in which the subproblems are solved inexactly and hence have closed-form solutions. We prove global convergence of the proposed I-ADMM, and the theoretical result provides a guideline for parameter setting. Numerical experiments show that the proposed I-ADMM can recover state density matrices of 5 qubits on a laptop in 0.69 s, with 6 \u00d7 10 -4 accuracy (99.38% fidelity) using 30% compressive sensing measurements, which outperforms existing algorithms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)", "quantum state estimation (QSE)", "robust principal component analysis (RPCA)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)", "Convergence", "Convex functions", "Pollution measurement", "Quantum Computing", "quantum state estimation (QSE)", "Robust principal component analysis", "Sparse matrices", "Task analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046492000", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57194018028": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57194018028", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7005067661": {"Name": "Cong S.", "AuthorID": "7005067661", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "8540706700": {"Name": "Ling Q.", "AuthorID": "8540706700", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55488020900": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55488020900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
