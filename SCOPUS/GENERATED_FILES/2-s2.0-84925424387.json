Methods: MRI scans of 105 patients with CAA pathologic confirmation and MRI were analyzed for CSS (focal, \u22643 sulci; disseminates, \u22654 sulci) and other imaging markers. We compared pathologic, imaging, and APOE genotype data between subjects with vs without ICH, and investigated associations between CSS and APOE genotype. Results: Our cohort consisted of 54 patients with CAA with symptomatic lobar ICH and 51 without ICH. APOE genotype was available in 53 patients. More than 90% of pathology samples in both groups had neuritic plaques, whereas neurofibrillary tangles were more commonly present in the patients without ICH (87% vs 42%, p < 0.0001). There was a trend for patients with CAA with ICH to more commonly have APOE \u03b52 (48.7% vs 21.4%, p 0.075), whereas patients without ICH were more likely to be APOE \u03b54 carriers (85.7% vs 53.9%, p 0.035). Disseminated CSS was considerably commoner in patients with ICH (33.3% vs 5.9%, p < 0.0001). In logistic regression, disseminated CSS was associated with APOE \u03b52 (but not APOE \u03b54) (odds ratio 5.83; 95% confidence interval 1.49-22.82, p 0.011). Conclusions: This neuropathologically defined CAA cohort suggests that CSS and APOE \u03b52 are related to the hemorrhagic expression of the disease; APOE \u03b54 is enriched in nonhemorrhagic CAA. Our study emphasizes the concept of different CAA phenotypes, suggesting divergent pathophysiologic mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Apolipoprotein E2", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Biomarkers", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Female", "Genotype", "Hemosiderosis", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925424387", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36676862000": {"Name": "Charidimou A.", "AuthorID": "36676862000", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "23397962300": {"Name": "Martinez-Ramirez S.", "AuthorID": "23397962300", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "21934879100": {"Name": "Shoamanesh A.", "AuthorID": "21934879100", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "7003775130": {"Name": "Oliveira-Filho J.", "AuthorID": "7003775130", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "55533036000": {"Name": "Vashkevich A.", "AuthorID": "55533036000", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "37030487900": {"Name": "Ayres A.", "AuthorID": "37030487900", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "6701794559": {"Name": "Rosand J.", "AuthorID": "6701794559", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "8084704100": {"Name": "Gurol M.E.", "AuthorID": "8084704100", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "57203056693": {"Name": "Greenberg S.M.", "AuthorID": "57203056693", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "13605493100": {"Name": "Viswanathan A.", "AuthorID": "13605493100", "AffiliationID": "115089572", "AffiliationName": "Hemorrhagic Stroke Research Program, Stroke Research Center, Department of Neurology"}, "7103306284": {"Name": "Frosch M.", "AuthorID": "7103306284", "AffiliationID": "115088855", "AffiliationName": "C.S.
