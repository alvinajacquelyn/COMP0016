Aqueous solutions of polyvinyl alcohol, incorporated with citric acid-coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), are subject to infusion gyration to generate 100-300 nm diameter composite fibers, with controllable MNP loading. The fibers are stable in polar solvents, such as ethanol, and do not show any leaching of MNPs for over 4 weeks. Using acetaminophen as an example, we demonstrate that this material is effective in immobilization and triggered release of drugs, which is achieved by a moving external magnetic field. The remote actuation ability, coupled with biocompatibility and lightweight property, renders enormous potential for these fibers to be used as a smart drug release agent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["controlled drug release", "infusion gyration", "magnetic actuation", "nanofibers", "nanomaterials", "polymer-magnetic composites"], "IndexKeywords": ["Composite fibers", "Controlled drug release", "External magnetic field", "Magnetic actuation", "Magnetic nanoparti cles (MNPs)", "Polymer magnetic", "Remote actuations", "Triggered release", "Drug Liberation", "Magnetics", "Nanoparticles", "Polymers", "Polyvinyl Alcohol"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046807007", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55551220900": {"Name": "Perera A.", "AuthorID": "55551220900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54790515100": {"Name": "Coppens M.", "AuthorID": "54790515100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56666436800": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "56666436800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
