The exact role of these aggregates in the disease pathology is, however, still an open question. Any mechanism by which oligomeric A\u03b2 may cause damage to neuronal cells must, in one way or another, involve interactions with other molecules. Here, we identify proteins in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid that bind to stable protofibrils formed by an engineered variant of A\u03b242 (A\u03b242CC). We find that the protofibrils attract a substantial number of protein binding partners. Many of the 101 identified proteins are involved in lipid transport and metabolism, the complement system, or in hemostasis. Binding of representative proteins from all of these groups with micromolar affinity was confirmed using surface plasmon resonance. In addition, binding of apolipoprotein E to the protofibrils with nanomolar affinity was demonstrated. We also find that aggregation of A\u03b2 enhances protein binding, as lower amounts of proteins bind monomeric A\u03b2. Proteins that bind to A\u03b2 protofibrils might contribute to biological effects in which these aggregates are involved. Our results therefore suggest that an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which A\u03b2 causes cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration might be gained from studies carried out in biologically relevant matrices in which A\u03b2-binding proteins are present.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Blood Proteins", "Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins", "Escherichia coli", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Aggregates", "Protein Binding", "Protein Engineering", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Recombinant Proteins", "Surface Plasmon Resonance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925355903", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"56044771400": {"Name": "Rahman M.", "AuthorID": "56044771400", "AffiliationID": "60027152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU)"}, "6508167343": {"Name": "Lendel C.", "AuthorID": "6508167343", "AffiliationID": "60027152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU)"}, "56266429700": {"Name": "Hard T.", "AuthorID": "56266429700", "AffiliationID": "60027152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU)"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
