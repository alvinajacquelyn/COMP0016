Inflammatory responses to physical or psychological stressors are dependent on immunoregulation, which is indicated by a balanced expansion of effector T-cell populations and regulatory T cells. This balance is in part driven by microbial signals. The hygiene or \u201cold friends\u201d hypothesis posits that exposure to immunoregulation-inducing microorganisms is reduced in modern urban societies, leading to an epidemic of inflammatory disease and increased vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. With the global trend toward urbanization, humans are progressively spending more time in built environments, thereby, experiencing limited exposures to these immunoregulatory \u201cold friends.\u201d Here, we evaluate the implications of the global trend toward urbanization, and how this transition may affect human microbial exposures and human behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior", "Biodiversity hypothesis", "Built environment", "Hygiene hypothesis", "Microbiome", "Microbiome of the built environment", "Urbanization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environment Design", "Environment, Controlled", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Mental Health", "Microbiota"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995390419", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"25631459100": {"Name": "Stamper C.E.", "AuthorID": "25631459100", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience, University of Colorado Boulder"}, "55800632700": {"Name": "Gomez O.M.", "AuthorID": "55800632700", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience, University of Colorado Boulder"}, "57198519777": {"Name": "Smith D.G.", "AuthorID": "57198519777", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience, University of Colorado Boulder"}, "7006035504": {"Name": "Lowry C.A.", "AuthorID": "7006035504", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado"}, "32667820700": {"Name": "Hoisington A.J.", "AuthorID": "32667820700", "AffiliationID": "116069117", "AffiliationName": "Military and Veteran Microbiome Consortium for Research and Education (MVM-CoRE)"}, "57191958856": {"Name": "Bates K.L.", "AuthorID": "57191958856", "AffiliationID": "60022225", "AffiliationName": "US Air Force Academy"}, "7003958250": {"Name": "Kinney K.A.", "AuthorID": "7003958250", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas Austin"}, "6602615506": {"Name": "Postolache T.T.", "AuthorID": "6602615506", "AffiliationID": "112643046", "AffiliationName": "Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center"}, "15829272700": {"Name": "Brenner L.A.", "AuthorID": "15829272700", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado"}, "56708956000": {"Name": "Halweg-Edwards A.L.", "AuthorID": "56708956000", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado Boulder"}, "7102196411": {"Name": "Rook G.A.W.", "AuthorID": "7102196411", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clinical Microbiology, UCL (University College London)"}}}
