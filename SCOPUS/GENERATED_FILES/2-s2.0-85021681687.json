They are direct outcome of the underlying symmetries of a dynamical system and can be tested using data from future surveys such as Euclid. Using techniques from standard perturbation theory (SPT), previous studies of consistency relation have concentrated on continuity-momentum (Euler)-Poisson system of an ideal fluid. We investigate the consistency relations in effective field theory (EFT) which adjusts the SPT predictions to account for the departure from the ideal fluid description on small scales. We provide detailed results for the 3D density contrast \u03b4 as well as the scaled divergence of velocity . Assuming a \u039bCDM background cosmology, we find the correction to SPT results becomes important at k \u2273 0.05 h/Mpc and that the suppression from EFT to SPT results that scales as square of the wave number k, can reach 40% of the total at k \u2248 0.25 h/Mpc at z = 0. We have also investigated whether effective field theory corrections to models of primordial non-Gaussianity can alter the squeezed limit behaviour, finding the results to be rather insensitive to these counterterms. In addition, we present the EFT corrections to the squeezed limit of the bispectrum in redshift space which may be of interest for tests of theories of modified gravity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Modified gravity", "power spectrum", "redshift surveys"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021681687", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"35318355900": {"Name": "Munshi D.", "AuthorID": "35318355900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "36343995700": {"Name": "Regan D.", "AuthorID": "36343995700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}}}
