Using a systems biology approach, metabolomics in umbilical cord blood (UCB) may offer insight into many perinatal disease processes by uniquely detecting rapid biochemical pathway alterations. In vitro haemolysis is a common technical problem affecting UCB sampling in the delivery room, and can hamper metabolomic analysis. The extent of metabolomic alteration which occurs in haemolysed samples is unknown. Design and methods: Visual haemolysis was designated by the laboratory technician using a standardised haemolysis index colour chart. The metabolomic profile of haemolysed and non-haemolysed UCB serum samples from 69 healthy term infants was compared using both 1H-NMR and targeted DI and LC-MS/MS approach. Results: We identified 43 metabolites that are significantly altered in visually haemolysed UCB samples, acylcarnitines (n. =. 2), glycerophospholipids (n. =. 23), sphingolipids (n. =. 7), sugars (n. =. 3), amino acids (n. =. 4) and Krebs cycle intermediates (n. =. 4). Conclusion: This information will be useful for researchers in the field of neonatal metabolomics to avoid false findings in the presence of haemolysis, to ensure reproducible and credible results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biobanking", "Haemolysis", "Hemolysis", "Metabolomics", "Umbilical cord blood"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Fetal Blood", "Hemolysis", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Metabolomics", "Pregnancy", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928742406", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"55955351000": {"Name": "Denihan N.", "AuthorID": "55955351000", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group (NBRG), Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork and Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "36969568200": {"Name": "Walsh B.", "AuthorID": "36969568200", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group (NBRG), Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork and Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group (NBRG), Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork and Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "14058615200": {"Name": "Murray D.", "AuthorID": "14058615200", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group (NBRG), Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork and Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "22136002400": {"Name": "Reinke S.", "AuthorID": "22136002400", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta"}, "7004348557": {"Name": "Broadhurst D.", "AuthorID": "7004348557", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Alberta"}, "57197616373": {"Name": "Sykes B.", "AuthorID": "57197616373", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta"}, "7006113503": {"Name": "Mandal R.", "AuthorID": "7006113503", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Computing Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "7005602630": {"Name": "Wishart D.", "AuthorID": "7005602630", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Computing Sciences, University of Alberta"}}}
