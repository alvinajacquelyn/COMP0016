Here, we reveal an essential role for Ca2+ derived from the endo-lysosomal system in maintaining contact between endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Antagonizing action of the Ca2+-mobilizing messenger NAADP, inhibiting its target endo-lysosomal ion channel, TPC1, and buffering local Ca2+ fluxes all clustered and enlarged late endosomes/lysosomes. We show that TPC1 localizes to ER-endosome contact sites and is required for their formation. Reducing NAADP-dependent contacts delayed EGF receptor de-phosphorylation consistent with close apposition of endocytosed receptors with the ER-localized phosphatase PTP1B. In accord, downstream MAP kinase activation and mobilization of ER Ca2+ stores by EGF were exaggerated upon NAADP blockade. Membrane contact sites between endosomes and the ER thus emerge as Ca2+-dependent hubs for signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acidic Ca2+ stores", "Ca2+", "EGF", "endoplasmic reticulum", "endosomes", "lysosomes", "membrane contact sites", "NAADP", "TPC1", "TPC2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cells, Cultured", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Endosomes", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Lysosomes", "Membranes", "NADP", "Phosphorylation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013213253", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55915788000": {"Name": "Kilpatrick B.", "AuthorID": "55915788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56487542500": {"Name": "Hockey L.", "AuthorID": "56487542500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57191957825": {"Name": "Yates E.", "AuthorID": "57191957825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7004743246": {"Name": "Eden E.", "AuthorID": "7004743246", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8854249500": {"Name": "Futter C.", "AuthorID": "8854249500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
