In this study, the value-adding ego-networks of the business owners in four Chinese construction small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are examined. The relationship between the business owner and six main stakeholder groups was identified, quantified, analyzed, and visualized using SNA. Relationships were measured according to the frequency of communication, the value of favour exchanges, and the amount of emotional investment in the relationship. Comparative SNA studies were conducted, focusing on ego-network density, tie strength, and prominence of key stakeholders. The findings highlighted the high degree of the structural and relational embeddedness in Chinese SMEs with Guanxi ties (both strong and weak) dominating the construction business-owners' network. They also underlined the prominence of the internal markets of multiskilled employees and business-development managers. Transactional ties, albeit a minority, also exist in the business-owners' network, which confirms that both relational and transactional marketing coexist in the Chinese construction industry. The study draws managerial implications for entrepreneurial business owners and managers, and proposes directions for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Construction industry", "Guanxi", "Relationship marketing (RM)", "Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)", "Social-network theory, social-network analysis (SNA)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969920070", "SubjectAreas": [["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"56829337100": {"Name": "Badi S.", "AuthorID": "56829337100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CONA@UCL, The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "57189384045": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57189384045", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CONA@UCL, The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "6603787961": {"Name": "Pryke S.", "AuthorID": "6603787961", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CONA@UCL, The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}}}
