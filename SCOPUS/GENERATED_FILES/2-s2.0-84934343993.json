Consequently, spectrally efficient direct detection transceiver-based solutions are attractive for such applications. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) transmission of 7\u00d7 12 GHz-spaced dispersion pre-compensated Nyquist pulse-shaped 16-QAM subcarrier modulated channels operating at a net bit rate of 24 Gb/s per channel, and achieving a net optical ISD of 2.0 b/s/Hz. The direct detection receiver used in our experiment consisted of a single-ended photodiode and a single analog-to-digital converter. The carrier-to-signal power ratio at different values of optical signal-to-noise ratio was optimized to maximize the receiver sensitivity performance. The transmission experiments were carried out using a recirculating fiber loop with uncompensated standard single-mode fiber and EDFA-only amplification. The maximum achieved transmission distances for single channel and WDM signals were 727 and 323 km below the bit-error ratio of {3.8\\times 10^{-3}}, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest achieved ISD for WDM transmission in direct detection links over such distances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital signal processing", "Direct detection", "Information spectral density", "Nyquist pulse shaping", "Optical fiber communication", "Single sideband signaling", "Subcarrier modulation", "Transceiver design", "Wavelength division multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct detection", "Information spectral density", "Nyquist pulse", "Single side bands", "Sub-carrier modulations", "Transceiver design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934343993", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"37028187400": {"Name": "Erkilinc M.", "AuthorID": "37028187400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602650040": {"Name": "Pachnicke S.", "AuthorID": "6602650040", "AffiliationID": "60113089", "AffiliationName": "ADVA Optical Networking SE"}, "14019344200": {"Name": "Griesser H.", "AuthorID": "14019344200", "AffiliationID": "60113089", "AffiliationName": "ADVA Optical Networking SE"}}}
