This study compares the dose distributions of complex meningioma plans produced by three proton TPSs: Eclipse, Pinnacle3, and XiO. All three systems were commissioned with the same beam data and, as best as possible, matched configuration settings. Proton treatment plans for ten patients were produced on each system with a pencil beam scanning, single-field uniform dose approach, using a fixed horizontal beamline. All 30 plans were subjected to identical dose constraints, both for the target coverage and organ at risk (OAR) sparing, with a consistent order of priority. Beam geometry, lateral field margins, and lateral spot resolutions were made consistent across all systems. Few statistically significant differences were found between the target coverage and OAR sparing of each system, with all optimizers managing to produce plans within clinical tolerances (D2 < 107% of prescribed dose, D5 < 105%, D95 > 95%, D99 > 90%, and OAR maximum doses) despite strict constraints and overlapping structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Particle therapy", "Planning comparison", "Proton therapy", "Treatment planning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Algorithms", "Humans", "Humans", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Meningioma", "Meningioma", "Middle Aged", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Grading", "Proton Therapy", "Proton Therapy", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated", "Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated", "Synchrotrons", "Synchrotrons", "Young Adult", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922900708", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55940973700": {"Name": "Doolan P.J.", "AuthorID": "55940973700", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "56518237000": {"Name": "Alshaikhi J.", "AuthorID": "56518237000", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7202353675": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "7202353675", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7005472272": {"Name": "Royle G.", "AuthorID": "7005472272", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "56517665100": {"Name": "Rosenberg I.", "AuthorID": "56517665100", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "57195021132": {"Name": "Ainsley C.G.", "AuthorID": "57195021132", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7006409607": {"Name": "D'Souza D.", "AuthorID": "7006409607", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "6602447240": {"Name": "Bentefour E.H.", "AuthorID": "6602447240", "AffiliationID": "60081490", "AffiliationName": "Ion Beam Applications"}}}
