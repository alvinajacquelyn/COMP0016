Compared with baseline, participants reported significantly higher quality of life, Mediterranean diet adherence and exercising more, up to 2 months after the groups. Participants valued the groups and felt enabled to improve their well-being.Conclusions Brainfood was acceptable and feasible to implement in an NHS setting.Declaration of interest A.B. and C.C. developed Brainfood - they hold a creative commons license for the manual and make it available to use for free to all.
