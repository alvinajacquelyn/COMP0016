To date, exhaustive algorithms that find the most likely set of ancestral states (joint reconstruction) have running times that scale exponentially with the number of sequences and are thus limited to very few taxa. The time requirement of our new algorithm scales linearly with the number of sequences and is therefore applicable to practically any number of taxa. A detailed description of the new algorithm and an example of its application to cytochrome b sequences are provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ancestral sequences", "Dynamic programming", "Fast algorithm", "Joint reconstruction", "Maximum likelihood", "Molecular evolution"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-0034117082", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"6602122809": {"Name": "Pupko T.", "AuthorID": "6602122809", "AffiliationID": "60072443, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, George S.
