Agents exert effort to develop their solutions, but their outcomes are unknown due to technical uncertainty and/or subjective evaluation criteria. To incentivize agents to make their best effort, the organizer needs to devise a proper award scheme. While extant literature either assumes a winner-take-all scheme a priori or shows its optimality under specific distributions for uncertainty, this paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the winner-take-all scheme is optimal. These conditions are violated when agents perceive it very likely that only few agents receive high evaluation or when a tournament does not require substantial increase in agents' marginal cost of effort to develop high-quality solutions. Yet, the winner-take-all scheme is optimal in many practical situations, especially when agents have symmetric beliefs about their evaluation. In this case, the organizer should offer a larger winner prize when he is interested in obtaining a higher number of good solutions, but interestingly the organizer need not necessarily raise the winner prize when anticipating more participants to a tournament.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Games/group decisions", "Innovation", "Research and development", "Tournament"], "IndexKeywords": ["Games/group decisions", "High-quality solutions", "Independent agents", "Research and development", "Specific distribution", "Subjective evaluations", "Tournament", "Winner take alls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021714887", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"24721201300": {"Name": "Ales L.", "AuthorID": "24721201300", "AffiliationID": "60116234, 60027950", "AffiliationName": "Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "56984278200": {"Name": "Cho S.", "AuthorID": "56984278200", "AffiliationID": "60116234, 60027950", "AffiliationName": "Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "35217727900": {"Name": "K\u00f6rpeo\u01e7lu E.", "AuthorID": "35217727900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}}}
