A deductive-inductive thematic analysis identified three recurring themes in the parent-child talk: realistic fiction, scaffolding variations, and engaged players and objects of 'play'. The themes suggested that Vygotsky's theory has particular relevance in exploring the learning processes facilitated by the iPad app. In addition, however, post-Vygotskian theoretical frameworks were helpful in capturing the dynamic co-construction of the authentic and multimedia stories parents and children shared.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944281508", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}, "9636302500": {"Name": "Sheehy K.", "AuthorID": "9636302500", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}, "7003663130": {"Name": "Messer D.", "AuthorID": "7003663130", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}}}
