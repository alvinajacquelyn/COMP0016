This modulation could underpin well documented changes in EEG/MEG activity indicating the existence of a mirror neuron system in humans. Because the local field potential (LFP) represents an important link between macaque single neuron and human noninvasive studies, we focused on mirror properties of intracortical LFPs recorded in the PMv and M1 hand regions in two macaques while they reached, grasped and held different objects, or observed the same actions performed by an experimenter. Upper limb EMGs were recorded to control for covert muscle activity during observation. The movement-related potential (MRP), investigated as intracortical low-frequency LFP activity (<9 Hz), was modulated in both M1 and PMv, not only during action execution but also during action observation. Moreover, the temporal LFP modulations during execution and observation were highly correlated in both cortical areas. Beta power in both PMv and M1 was clearly modulated in both conditions. Although the MRP was detected only during dynamic periods of the task (reach/grasp/release), beta decreased during dynamic and increased during static periods (hold). Comparison of LFPs for different grasps provided evidence for partially nonoverlapping networks being active during execution and observation, which might be related to different inputs to motor areas during these conditions. We found substantial information about grasp in the MRP corroborating its suitability for brain\u2013machine interfaces, although information about grasp was generally low during action observation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action execution and observation", "Intracortical", "LFP", "Local field potential"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Electroencephalography", "Electromyography", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Hand Strength", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Mirror Neurons", "Motor Cortex", "Movement", "Observation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reaction Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930431166", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56008043500": {"Name": "Waldert S.", "AuthorID": "56008043500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "52664431700": {"Name": "Vigneswaran G.", "AuthorID": "52664431700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "13612111000": {"Name": "Philipp R.", "AuthorID": "13612111000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102027025": {"Name": "Lemon R.N.", "AuthorID": "7102027025", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602907373": {"Name": "Kraskov A.", "AuthorID": "6602907373", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
