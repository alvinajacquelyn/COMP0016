Although seen more commonly in the setting of atrioventricular septal defect, this arrangement can also be found when one of the atrioventricular connections is atretic due to absence of the atrioventricular connection and the other atrioventricular valve straddles the muscular ventricular septum. It is the specific anatomy and connections of the atrioventricular junction that clarifies the situation and distinguishes between these two types of double outlet atrium. In this report, we present a case of double outlet right atrium co-existing with the absence of left atrioventricular connection. We then discuss the morphologic aspects of this interesting anomaly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrioventricular junction", "atrioventricular septal defect", "double outlet atrium", "x plane imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941651617", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57209786155": {"Name": "Gupta S.K.", "AuthorID": "57209786155", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "57217863930": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57217863930", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "57211740315": {"Name": "Ramakrishnan S.", "AuthorID": "57211740315", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, University of Newcastle"}}}
