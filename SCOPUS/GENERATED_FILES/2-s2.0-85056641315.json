This enhanced T-cell reconstitution differs from that seen after stem cell transplant from other stem cell sources, but the mechanism is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription profile of naive CD4+ T cells from cord blood and that of lymphocytes reconstituting after cord blood transplantation is similar to the transcription profile of fetal CD4+ T cells. This profile is distinct to that of naive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and that of lymphocytes reconstituting after T-replete bone marrow transplantation. The transcription profile of reconstituting naive CD4+ T cells from cord blood transplant recipients was upregulated in the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway and its transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Furthermore, a small molecule inhibitor of AP-1 proportionally inhibited cord blood CD4+ T-cell proliferation (P ,<05). Together, these findings suggest that reconstituting cord blood CD4+ T cells reflect the properties of fetal ontogenesis, and enhanced TCR signaling is responsible for the rapid restoration of the unique CD4+ T-cell biased adaptive immunity after cord blood transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056641315", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"6507833168": {"Name": "Hiwarkar P.", "AuthorID": "6507833168", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.J.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57203072549": {"Name": "Hubank M.", "AuthorID": "57203072549", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "55362669500": {"Name": "Chiesa R.", "AuthorID": "55362669500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.C.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7004019930": {"Name": "Saudemont A.", "AuthorID": "7004019930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}}}
