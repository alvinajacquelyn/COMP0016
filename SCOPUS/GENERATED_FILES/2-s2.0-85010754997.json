The excitonic and quasiparticle gaps of the C2/c, Pc, Pbcn, and P63/m structures at pressures of 250, 300, and 350 GPa are calculated using the fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method. The difference between the mean-field and many-body band gaps at the same density is found to be almost independent of system size and can therefore be applied as a scissor correction to the mean-field gap of an infinite system to obtain an estimate of the many-body gap in the thermodynamic limit. By comparing our static-nucleus DMC energy gaps with available experimental results, we demonstrate the important role played by nuclear quantum effects in the electronic structure of solid hydrogen.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010754997", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"14627363100": {"Name": "Azadi S.", "AuthorID": "14627363100", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60175885, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London, Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "7101673327": {"Name": "Foulkes W.M.C.", "AuthorID": "7101673327", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60175885, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London, Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "8241383700": {"Name": "Drummond N.D.", "AuthorID": "8241383700", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}}}
