In contrast, similar reactions using unsaturated Os3(CO)8(\u03bc-dppf)(\u03bc-H)2 (2) [dppf = bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene] afforded only the trinuclear complexes Os3(CO)8(\u03bc-dppf)(\u03bc-\u03b72;\u03b71-RO2CCHCCO2R)(\u03bc-H) (5a, R = Me; 5b, R = Et) and Os3(CO)7(\u03bc-dppf)(\u03bc3-\u03b72;\u03b71;\u03b71-RO2CCCCO2R)(\u03bc-H)2 (6a, R = Me; 6b, R = Et). Control experiments confirm that 5a and 5b decarbonylate at 80 \u00b0C to give 6a and 6b, respectively. Both 5a and 5b exist as a pair of isomers in solution, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations on cluster 5a (as the dppf-Me4 derivative) indicate that the isomeric mixture derives from a torsional motion that promotes the conformational flipping of the cyclopentadienyl groups of the dppf-Me4 ligand relative to the metallic plane. VT NMR measurements on clusters 6a and 6b indicate that while the hydride ligand associated with the dppf-bridged Os-Os bond is nonfluxional at room temperature, the second hydride rapidly oscillates between the two non-dppf-bridged Os-Os edges. DFT examination of this hydride fluxionality confirms a \u201cwindshield wiper\u201d motion for the labile hydride that gives rise to a time-average coupling of this hydride to both phosphorus centers of the dppf ligand. Thermolysis of 6a and 6b in refluxing toluene yielded Os3(CO)7(\u03bc-dppf)(\u03bc-\u03b72;\u03b71;\u043a1-CCHCO2R) (7a, R=Me; 7b, R=Et). The vinylidene moieties in 7a and 7b derive from the carbon-carbon bond cleavage of coordinated alkyne ligands, and these two products exhibit high thermal stability in refluxing toluene.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activated alkynes", "C-C bond scission", "DFT", "Diphosphines", "Reversible C-H bond activation", "Unsaturated osmium clusters"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activated alkynes", "C-C bonds", "CH-bond activation", "Diphosphines", "Osmium cluster"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015022034", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57216229367": {"Name": "Chowdhury M.A.H.", "AuthorID": "57216229367", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "56186166500": {"Name": "Haque M.R.", "AuthorID": "56186166500", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.E.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Georg-August University, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry"}, "6701473214": {"Name": "Mobin S.M.", "AuthorID": "6701473214", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Chemistry, School of Basic Science, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004115416": {"Name": "Hogarth G.", "AuthorID": "7004115416", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "7103239169": {"Name": "Richmond M.G.", "AuthorID": "7103239169", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35569662900": {"Name": "Roesky H.W.", "AuthorID": "35569662900", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Georg-August University, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry"}}}
