We observe that sodiation causes an increase in the Sn anode resistivity by six orders of magnitude. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the Na-Sn alloy system demonstrate that the increased resistivity of the anode is caused by the formation of an electrically resistive amorphous NaSn phase (a-NaSn) with a pseudogap. It is also observed that the formation of a-NaSn is always accompanied by a large volume expansion of \u223c200%, causing the development of residual tensile stress. The residual stress in turn alters the electronic structure of the a-NaSn phase, further increasing the resistivity of a-NaSn and thus decreasing the energy efficiency of the Na-Sn battery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ab initio calculation", "Electrical resistivity", "Phase transition", "Pseudogap", "Sodiation", "Sodium-ion battery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation", "Large volumes", "Orders of magnitude", "Pseudo-gap", "Residual tensile stress", "Situ scanning electron microscopies (SEM)", "Sodiation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010711627", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57147393500": {"Name": "Byeon Y.W.", "AuthorID": "57147393500", "AffiliationID": "60025960", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Analysis Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology"}, "57220741435": {"Name": "Choi Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57220741435", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University"}, "13008893000": {"Name": "Lee J.C.", "AuthorID": "13008893000", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University"}, "7403019705": {"Name": "Ahn J.P.", "AuthorID": "7403019705", "AffiliationID": "60025960", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Analysis Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology"}}}
