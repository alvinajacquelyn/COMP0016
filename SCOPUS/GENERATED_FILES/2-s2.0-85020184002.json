We start by examining the vertical interactions within the Multilayer model framework, and in doing so, we return to hypothesis 3: How can trade be facilitated and investment and growth take place by leveraging transport logistics accessibility as well as the economic and sociological factors of the SPICs? In Chap. 5, we discussed on the basis of hypothesis 3, how to evaluate Port Attractiveness in order to foster economic growth and investment. Thereafter in Chaps. 6 and 7, we analysed the topological structure of the networks and identified the impacts of economies of scale and trade agreements. Our next endeavour is to integrate these different layers by connecting the factors already highlighted in the Port Attractiveness Index, and above all to test the analyses and results obtained in Chaps. 5, 6 and 7 for the networks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020184002", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6603380130": {"Name": "Medda F.", "AuthorID": "6603380130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "36157854300": {"Name": "Caravelli F.", "AuthorID": "36157854300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "36462364400": {"Name": "Caschili S.", "AuthorID": "36462364400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "QASER Laboratory, University College London"}, "7404870460": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "7404870460", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
