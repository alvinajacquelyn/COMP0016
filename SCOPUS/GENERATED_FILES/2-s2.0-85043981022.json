Our aim was therefore to develop a systematic and novel approach to the formulation of a simple drug-in-adhesive ungual patch. Twelve pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs), four backing membranes, two release liners and three drugs were screened for pharmaceutical and mechanical properties. From this initial screening, two PSAs, two drugs, one backing membrane and one release liner were selected for further investigation. Patches were prepared by solvent-casting and characterised. The patches had good uniformity of thickness and of drug content, and showed minimal drug crystallisation during six months of storage. Meanwhile, the drug stability in the patch upon storage and patch adhesion to the nail was influenced by the nature of the drug, the PSA and the backing membrane. The reported methodology paves the way for a systematic formulation of ungual nail patches to add to the armamentarium of nail medicines. Further, from this work, the best patch formulation has been identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nail", "Onychomycosis", "Patch", "Peel tests", "Pressure-sensitive adhesive", "Tack", "Work of adhesion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adhesives", "Administration, Cutaneous", "Administration, Topical", "Antifungal Agents", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Carriers", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Nail Diseases", "Nails", "Onychomycosis", "Permeability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043981022", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"36700218700": {"Name": "Rizi K.", "AuthorID": "36700218700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of PharmaceuticsUCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57201210255": {"Name": "Xu K.", "AuthorID": "57201210255", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of PharmaceuticsUCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55078653600": {"Name": "Murdan S.", "AuthorID": "55078653600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of PharmaceuticsUCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55390077900": {"Name": "Mohammed I.K.", "AuthorID": "55390077900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical EngineeringImperial College London"}, "7006498644": {"Name": "Kinloch A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006498644", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical EngineeringImperial College London"}, "6603770144": {"Name": "Charalambides M.N.", "AuthorID": "6603770144", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical EngineeringImperial College London"}}}
