KGaA, WeinheimThe conversion of ethanol to 1,3-butadiene (1,3-BD) has been investigated over ZrO2- and ZnO-containing magnesia silica oxides prepared by a co-precipitation method at different Mg-to-Si molar ratios. The effect of reaction temperature and ethanol flow rate was investigated. The catalyst acidity was modified through the addition of alkali metals (Na, K and Li) to the final materials. Catalysts were characterised by nitrogen physisorption analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, infrared spectroscopy and 29Si/(7Li) NMR spectroscopy. The catalytic results showed that the controlled reduction of catalyst acidity allows ethanol dehydration to be suppressed, whilst increasing 1,3-BD selectivity. The best catalytic performance achieved 72 mol % for the combined 1,3-BD and acetaldehyde selectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1,3-butadiene", "ethanol", "green chemistry", "heterogeneous catalysis", "silica magnesia catalyst"], "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,3-butadiene", "Catalytic performance", "Controlled reduction", "Coprecipitation method", "Energy dispersive x-ray", "Green chemistry", "Nitrogen physisorption", "Reaction temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977590531", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55626470100": {"Name": "Da Ros S.", "AuthorID": "55626470100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "35465490100": {"Name": "Pinto J.", "AuthorID": "35465490100", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Programa de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica/COPPE, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"}, "35230030600": {"Name": "Jones M.", "AuthorID": "35230030600", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "23991000700": {"Name": "Mattia D.", "AuthorID": "23991000700", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "14033105200": {"Name": "Schwaab M.", "AuthorID": "14033105200", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "7004514118": {"Name": "Noronha F.", "AuthorID": "7004514118", "AffiliationID": "60012366", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Division, National Institute of Technology"}, "7801633326": {"Name": "Kondrat S.", "AuthorID": "7801633326", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University"}, "56184668300": {"Name": "Clarke T.", "AuthorID": "56184668300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University"}, "7404757166": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "7404757166", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University"}}}
