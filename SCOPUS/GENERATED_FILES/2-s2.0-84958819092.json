Within coastal geomorphology, capturing these feedbacks is critically important, especially as the focus of activity shifts from reductionist models founded on sediment transport fundamentals to more synthesist ones intended to resolve emergent behaviours at decadal to centennial scales. This paper addresses the challenge of mapping the feedback structure of processes controlling geomorphic system behaviour with reference to illustrative applications of Causal Loop Analysis at two study cases: (1) the erosion-accretion behaviour of graded (mixed) sediment beds, and (2) the local alongshore sediment fluxes of sand-rich shorelines. These case study examples are chosen on account of their central role in the quantitative modelling of geomorphological futures and as they illustrate different types of causation. Causal loop diagrams, a form of directed graph, are used to distil the feedback structure to reveal, in advance of more quantitative modelling, multi-response pathways and multiple outcomes. In the case of graded sediment bed, up to three different outcomes (no response, and two disequilibrium states) can be derived from a simple qualitative stability analysis. For the sand-rich local shoreline behaviour case, two fundamentally different responses of the shoreline (diffusive and anti-diffusive), triggered by small changes of the shoreline cross-shore position, can be inferred purely through analysis of the causal pathways. Explicit depiction of feedback-structure diagrams is beneficial when developing numerical models to explore coastal morphological futures. By explicitly mapping the feedbacks included and neglected within a model, the modeller can readily assess if critical feedback loops are included.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural model", "Causal loop diagram", "Directed graph", "Emergent behaviour", "Feedback analysis", "High Angle Wave Instability", "Systems analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958819092", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"24802308800": {"Name": "Payo A.", "AuthorID": "24802308800", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Centre for the Environment"}, "57173422400": {"Name": "Hall J.W.", "AuthorID": "57173422400", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Centre for the Environment"}, "55597277200": {"Name": "French J.", "AuthorID": "55597277200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CL Department of Geography, Coastal and Estuarine Research Unit, University College London"}, "7202056229": {"Name": "Sutherland J.", "AuthorID": "7202056229", "AffiliationID": "60025658", "AffiliationName": "HR Wallingford"}, "24391467000": {"Name": "van Maanen B.", "AuthorID": "24391467000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment"}, "35502560300": {"Name": "Nicholls R.J.", "AuthorID": "35502560300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment"}, "7102510774": {"Name": "Reeve D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102510774", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Swansea University, College of Engineering, Singleton Park"}}}
