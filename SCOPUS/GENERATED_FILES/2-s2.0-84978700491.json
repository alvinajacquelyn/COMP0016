Design, setting and participants: Analysis of data provided to the Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES; survey response rate, 37.7%) by 1552 patients with one of 19 cancer types and treated in one of five Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre hospitals, 1 October 2012 - 30 April 2013. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had had three or more GP consultations about cancer-related health problems before being referred to hospital. The secondary outcome was the interval between the patient first suspecting a problem and their seeing a hospital specialist. Results: 34% of the patients included in the final analyses (426 of 1248) had visited a GP at least three times before referral to a hospital doctor. The odds ratios (reference: rectal cancer; adjusted for age, sex, language spoken at home, and socioeconomic disadvantage index score) varied according to cancer type, being highest for pancreatic cancer (3.2; 95% CI, 1.02-9.9), thyroid cancer (2.5; 95% CI, 0.9-6.6), vulval cancer (2.5; 95% CI, 0.7-8.7) and multiple myeloma (2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.5), and lowest for patients with breast cancer (0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8), cervical cancer (0.5; 95% CI, 0.1-2.1), endometrial cancer (0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-1.4) or melanoma (0.7; 95% CI, 0.3-1.5). Cancer type also affected the duration of the interval from symptom onset to seeing a hospital doctor; it took at least 3 months for more than one-third of patients with prostate or colon cancer to see a hospital doctor. Conclusion: Certain cancer types were more frequently associated with multiple GP visits, suggesting they are more challenging to recognise early. In Victoria, longer intervals from the first symptoms to seeing a hospital doctor for colon or prostate cancer may reflect poorer community symptom awareness, later GP referral, or limited access to gastroenterology and urology services.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Female", "General Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Referral and Consultation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Victoria", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978700491", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57190252508": {"Name": "Lacey K.", "AuthorID": "57190252508", "AffiliationID": "112590185", "AffiliationName": "Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre"}, "7402085225": {"Name": "Bishop J.", "AuthorID": "7402085225", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "57190254020": {"Name": "Cross H.", "AuthorID": "57190254020", "AffiliationID": "112590185", "AffiliationName": "Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre"}, "6603349275": {"Name": "Chondros P.", "AuthorID": "6603349275", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "55537174500": {"Name": "Emery J.", "AuthorID": "55537174500", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}}}
