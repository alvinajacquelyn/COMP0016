This is an improvement over the best previously known result by several orders of magnitude, and it shows that spin-glass-like frustration can occur in translationally invariant quantum systems with a local dimension comparable to the smallest-known non-translationally invariant systems with similar behaviour. While previous constructions of such systems rely on standard models of quantum computation, we construct a new model that is particularly well-suited for encoding quantum computation into the ground state of a translationally invariant system. This allows us to shift the proof burden from optimizing the Hamiltonian encoding a standard computational model, to proving universality of a simple model. Previous techniques for encoding quantum computation into the ground state of a local Hamiltonian allow only a linear sequence of gates, hence only a linear (or nearly linear) path in the graph of all computational states. We extend these techniques by allowing significantly more general paths, including branching and cycles, thus enabling a highly efficient encoding of our computational model. However, this requires more sophisticated techniques for analysing the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian. To address this, we introduce a framework of graphs with unitary edge labels. After relating our Hamiltonian to the Laplacian of such a unitary labelled graph, we analyse its spectrum by combining matrix analysis and spectral graph theory techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032491263", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"]], "AuthorData": {"55949605100": {"Name": "Bausch J.", "AuthorID": "55949605100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "6602473220": {"Name": "Ozols M.", "AuthorID": "6602473220", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "23768101300": {"Name": "Cubitt T.", "AuthorID": "23768101300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
