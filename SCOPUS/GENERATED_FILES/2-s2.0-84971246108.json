We measured the P1-N1-P2 acoustic change complex elicited with synthetic overt (second formant, F2\u03b4 = 1000 Hz) and subtle (F2\u03b4 = 100 Hz) diphthongs, while subjects (i) attended to the auditory stimuli, (ii) ignored the auditory stimuli and watched a film, and (iii) diverted their attention to a visual discrimination task. Responses elicited by diphthongs where F2 values rose and fell were found to be different and this precluded their combined analysis. Multivariate analysis of ERP components from the rising F2 changes showed main effects of attention on P2 amplitude and latency, and N1-P2 amplitude. P2 amplitude decreased by 40% between the attend and ignore conditions, and by 60% between the attend and divert conditions. The effect of diphthong magnitude was significant for components from a broader temporal window which included P1 latency and N1 amplitude. N1 latency did not vary between attention conditions, a finding that may be related to stimulation with a continuous vowel. These data show that a discernible P1-N1-P2 response can be observed to subtle vowel quality transitions, even when the attention of a subject is diverted to an unrelated visual task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic change complex", "Attention", "ERP", "N1", "P2", "Vowel perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Attention", "Cerebral Cortex", "Discrimination (Psychology)", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Speech Perception", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971246108", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56816205300": {"Name": "Morris D.", "AuthorID": "56816205300", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics, University of Copenhagen"}, "14018705700": {"Name": "T\u00f8ndering J.", "AuthorID": "14018705700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics, University of Copenhagen"}, "57000454800": {"Name": "Steinmetzger K.", "AuthorID": "57000454800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}}}
