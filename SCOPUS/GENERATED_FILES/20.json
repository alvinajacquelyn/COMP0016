The sparse structure of the Robin coefficient \u03b3 is understood as a small perturbation of a reference profile \u03b30 in the sense that their difference \u03b3\u2212\u03b30 has a small support. This problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with an L1-regularization term. An iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm with an inner semismooth Newton iteration is employed to solve the resulting optimization problem, and the convergence of the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm is established. Numerical results for two-dimensional problems are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inverse Robin problem", "Iteratively reweighted least squares method", "Semismooth Newton method", "Sparsity regularization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84897353014", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56091189900": {"Name": "Sun Z.", "AuthorID": "56091189900", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University"}, "55885381100": {"Name": "Jiao Y.", "AuthorID": "55885381100", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University"}, "24468723000": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "24468723000", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of California, Riverside"}}}
