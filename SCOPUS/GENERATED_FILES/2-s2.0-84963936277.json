A proposed radio over fiber topology for beyond 4G deployment is addressed and a proof-of-concept SEFDM long term evolution (LTE) type radio over multimode fiber transmission is successfully demonstrated at 36Mb/s.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5G communications", "LTE", "non-orthogonal", "OFDM", "radio over fiber", "SEFDM", "spectral efficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fiber transmissions", "Non-orthogonal", "Proof of concept", "Radio over fiber system", "Radio over fiber technologies (RoF)", "SEFDM", "Spectral efficiencies", "Wireless data"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963936277", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7801636324": {"Name": "Mikroulis S.", "AuthorID": "7801636324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "55846144300": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "55846144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "8207205100": {"Name": "Mitchell J.", "AuthorID": "8207205100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
