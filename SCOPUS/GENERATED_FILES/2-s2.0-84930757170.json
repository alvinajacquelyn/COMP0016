When cardiovascular complications e.g., collateral vessel formation occur during the inter-stage periods, further treatments are required. An 8-month-old patient, who underwent second stage (i.e., bi-directional Glenn, BDG) surgery at 4 months, was diagnosed with a major veno-venous collateral vessel (VVC) which was endovascularly occluded to improve blood oxygen saturations. Few clinical data were collected at 8 months, whereas at 4 months a more detailed data set was available. The aim of this study is threefold: (i) to show how to build a patient-specific model describing the hemodynamics in the presence of VVC, using patient-specific clinical data collected at different times; (ii) to use this model to perform virtual VVC occlusion for quantitative hemodynamics prediction; and (iii) to compare predicted hemodynamics with post-operative measurements. The three-dimensional BDG geometry, resulting from the virtual surgery on the first stage model, was coupled with a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the 8-month patient\u2019s circulation. The latter was developed by scaling the 4-month LPM to account for changes in vascular impedances due to growth and adaptation. After virtual VVC closure, the model confirmed the 2 mmHg BDG pressure increase, as clinically observed, suggesting the importance of modeling vascular adaptation following the BDG procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Cardiovascular", "Congenital heart disease", "Finite volume method", "Lumped parameter model", "Multi-domain model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Cardiovascular", "Congenital heart disease", "Lumped parameter modeling", "Multi-domain modeling", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Models, Cardiovascular", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930757170", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"54882677100": {"Name": "Corsini C.", "AuthorID": "54882677100", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "54408092100": {"Name": "Baretta A.", "AuthorID": "54408092100", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "7005337879": {"Name": "Migliavacca F.", "AuthorID": "7005337879", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "7004162794": {"Name": "Pennati G.", "AuthorID": "7004162794", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering \u2018Giulio Natta\u2019, Politecnico di Milano"}, "57198875486": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "57198875486", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23099141600": {"Name": "Biglino G.", "AuthorID": "23099141600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54883432300": {"Name": "Hsia T.Y.", "AuthorID": "54883432300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12770860700": {"Name": "Hlavacek A.M.", "AuthorID": "12770860700", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina"}, "55479818600": {"Name": "Kung E.", "AuthorID": "55479818600", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California San Diego"}, "7006851741": {"Name": "Marsden A.", "AuthorID": "7006851741", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California San Diego"}, "13004394100": {"Name": "Vignon-Clementel I.", "AuthorID": "13004394100", "AffiliationID": "60072945, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 6"}}}
