We used criteria taken from the \u2018cognitive dimensions\u2019 literature and an exercise of typical geometric operations in ascending order of complexity. For each system the cognitive barriers associated with the sequence of operations were plotted to create a \u2018learning curve\u2019. Different parametric systems presented distinctly different learning curves. The test exercise had to be completed in its entirety to assess the potential challenges which students with different educational levels, skills and abilities might encounter, so a single expert user conducted the tests. This research is intended to develop methods, both design exercises and evaluative criteria that could be used in future empirical studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["architectural design", "design education", "evaluation", "human\u2013computer interaction", "parametric design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive dimensions", "Comparative evaluations", "Design Education", "Evaluation", "Geometric operations", "Parametric design", "Parametric design systems", "Undergraduate teaching"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026306926", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"6603318201": {"Name": "Aish R.", "AuthorID": "6603318201", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "8524984200": {"Name": "Hanna S.", "AuthorID": "8524984200", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}}}
