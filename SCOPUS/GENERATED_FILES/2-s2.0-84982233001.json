Building on this, within digital humanities there have been attempts to crowdsource more complex tasks traditionally assumed to be carried out by academic scholars, such as the accurate transcription of manuscript material. This chapter surveys the growth and uptake of crowdsourcing within digital humanities, raising issues which emerge when building projects for and with a wide online audience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Citizen science", "Crowdsourcing", "Digitization", "Online participation", "Public engagement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982233001", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"23568761100": {"Name": "Terras M.", "AuthorID": "23568761100", "AffiliationID": "124982375", "AffiliationName": "UCL's Department of Information Studies"}}}
