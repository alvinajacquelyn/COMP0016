Design: A systematic review of layperson perspectives of SA was conducted across MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, EMBASE and ISI Web of Knowledge. Participants: Peer-reviewed studies conducting qualitative investigations of lay perspectives of SA were included. Included studies were coded and analysed using NVivo V.9 to examine underlying themes of SA. Results: The search strategy identified 7285 articles; 26 articles met the inclusion criteria. Laypersons identified psychosocial components, notably engagement (eg, social engagement), and personal resources (eg, attitude) as integral components of SA more often than 'physiological' components, such as longevity or physical functioning. These results also highlight the profound under-representation of non-Western countries and the cultural homogeneity of research participants. Conclusions: The current study reveals the importance laypersons place on incorporating psychosocial components into multidimensional models of SA, as well as highlighting the need for increased research with under-represented populations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84878752337", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55948960700": {"Name": "Cosco T.D.", "AuthorID": "55948960700", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "57207840403": {"Name": "Prina A.M.", "AuthorID": "57207840403", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "57210386759": {"Name": "Brayne C.", "AuthorID": "57210386759", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "55326453200": {"Name": "Perales J.", "AuthorID": "55326453200", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "22136848800": {"Name": "Stephan B.C.M.", "AuthorID": "22136848800", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}}}
