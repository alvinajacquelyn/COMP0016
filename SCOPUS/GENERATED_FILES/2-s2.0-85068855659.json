To address this gap in the literature, this study aims to explore the journeys of sexual assault survivors with the use of narrative interviews to retain the richness of the data. This study reports the findings of a narrative analysis of the accounts of six female sexual assault survivors aged between 20 and 38. The analysis provides an individual case profile for each participant, the core aspects and tone of each narrative, and a cross-case analysis. The cross-case analysis reveals an overarching theme of \u201cthe bumpy journey\u201d within which the individual difficulties encountered are examined. The analysis also reveals the two main factors that motivated the participant to strive to make a difference for other sexual violence survivors and to improve their mental health through talking about their experiences. The implications for services providing continuous and long-term support to sexual assault survivors and clinical practices are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult survivors", "female", "mental health", "narrative analysis", "qualitative", "sexual assault", "trauma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068855659", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"57209826559": {"Name": "Yuen B.", "AuthorID": "57209826559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190061236": {"Name": "Billings J.", "AuthorID": "57190061236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603484587": {"Name": "Morant N.", "AuthorID": "6603484587", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
