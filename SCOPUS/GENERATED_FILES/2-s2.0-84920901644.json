They include Alzheimer disease, tangle-only dementia, Pick disease, argyrophilic grain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. Tau pathology appears to spread through intercellular propagation, requiring the formation of assembled \"prion-like\" species. Several cell and animal models have been described that recapitulate aspects of this phenomenon. However, the molecular characteristics of seed-competent Tau remain unclear. Here, we have used a cell model to understand the relationships between Tau structure/phosphorylation and seeding by aggregated Tau species from the brains of mice transgenic for human mutant P301S Tau and full-length aggregated recombinant P301S Tau. Deletion of motifs 275VQIINK280 and 306VQIVYK311 abolished the seeding activity of recombinant full-length Tau, suggesting that its aggregation was necessary for seeding. We describe conformational differences between native and synthetic Tau aggregates that may account for the higher seeding activity of native assembled Tau. When added to aggregated Tau seeds from the brains of mice transgenic for P301S Tau, soluble recombinant Tau aggregated and acquired the molecular properties of aggregated Tau from transgenic mouse brain. We show that seeding is conferred by aggregated Tau that enters cells through macropinocytosis and seeds the assembly of endogenous Tau into filaments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Animal model", "Conformational differences", "Inter-cellular propagation", "Molecular characteristics", "Molecular properties", "Tau pathology", "Transgenic mice", "Animals", "Brain", "Cytoskeleton", "Disease Models, Animal", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Aggregates", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Protein Conformation", "tau Proteins", "Tauopathies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920901644", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55652697600": {"Name": "Falcon B.", "AuthorID": "55652697600", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "10939507500": {"Name": "Angers R.", "AuthorID": "10939507500", "AffiliationID": "114887351", "AffiliationName": "N30 Pharmaceuticals, Inc."}, "7102098944": {"Name": "Goedert M.", "AuthorID": "7102098944", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "55819033800": {"Name": "Cavallini A.", "AuthorID": "55819033800", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "55820056100": {"Name": "Glover S.", "AuthorID": "55820056100", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "7401956361": {"Name": "Murray T.", "AuthorID": "7401956361", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "56480735800": {"Name": "Barnham L.", "AuthorID": "56480735800", "AffiliationID": "60072269", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research and Development"}, "57189632031": {"Name": "Jackson S.", "AuthorID": "57189632031", "AffiliationID": "60113760", "AffiliationName": "NC3Rs, Gibbs Bldg."}, "55663806500": {"Name": "O'Neill M.", "AuthorID": "55663806500", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "7103091119": {"Name": "Hutton M.", "AuthorID": "7103091119", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "7004237231": {"Name": "Szekeres P.", "AuthorID": "7004237231", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "7401626500": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626500", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co, Erl Wood Manor"}, "7005469062": {"Name": "Isaacs A.", "AuthorID": "7005469062", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}}}
