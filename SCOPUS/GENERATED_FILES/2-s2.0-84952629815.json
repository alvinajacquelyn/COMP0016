Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are regions where the membranes of two organelles come into close apposition allowing exchange of small molecules and ions including Ca2+. The ER, the cell's major Ca2+ store, forms an extensive and dynamic network of contacts with multiple organelles. Here we review established and emerging roles of ER contacts as platforms for Ca2+ exchange and further consider a potential role for Ca2+ in the regulation of MCS formation. We additionally discuss the challenges associated with the study of MCS biology and highlight advances in microscopy-based solutions.
