VESUVIO is equipped with yttrium-aluminium-perovskite gamma-sensitive detectors that can be used to record the Doppler-broadened line shape from a neutron-induced resonance in the neutron-energy range between 1 and 100 eV. The measurement of nuclear momentum distributions for heavy atoms using deep inelastic neutron scattering, the traditional technique for light-weight nuclei from hydrogen to fluorine, is currently severely limited by the resolution of the instrument. On the other hand, gamma-Dopplerimetry studies as the one presented here on gold allow for exquisite precision and short data-collection measurements, of the order of one hour, for the measurements, rendering the technique ideal for high-throughput investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Deep inelastic neutron scattering", "High-throughput materials", "Momentum distributions", "Neutron energy range", "Nuclear quantum effects", "Sensitive detector", "Traditional techniques", "VESUVIO spectrometer"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051713482", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54684802600": {"Name": "Romanelli G.", "AuthorID": "54684802600", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "9532905200": {"Name": "Krzystyniak M.", "AuthorID": "9532905200", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Campus"}, "55924594300": {"Name": "Fernandez-Alonso F.", "AuthorID": "55924594300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
