In particular, the new modelling approach combines the advantages of the classical zone method of radiation analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in a robust manner, and overcomes the difficulties of incorporating three-dimensional flow field within a zone method based model. The developed model has been validated with comprehensive experimental data collected during an instrumented bloom trial period that includes a long production delay. The results suggest that the model predictions were in good agreement with the actual measurements, and that the model was able to respond correctly with respect to the encountered production delay during the trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic flow pattern", "Isothermal CFD", "Reheating furnace", "Zone methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actual measurements", "Dynamic flows", "Model prediction", "Radiation analysis", "Reheating furnaces", "Thermal Performance", "Three dimensional flow field", "Zone method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963753642", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56116162600": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "56116162600", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "57193305182": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57193305182", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "7101866572": {"Name": "Roach P.", "AuthorID": "7101866572", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "16424733400": {"Name": "Broughton J.", "AuthorID": "16424733400", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel RandD Swinden Technology Centre"}}}
