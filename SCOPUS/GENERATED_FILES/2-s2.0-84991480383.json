EFT performance of 51 adults with ADHD was compared to the performance o 52 matched healthy individuals, as well as to 268 undergraduate students who were randoml allocated in a simulation design to one of four experimental conditions, i.e. a contro group, a na\u00efve simulation group, a symptom-coached simulation group or a test-coache simulation group. Furthermore, an independent sample of 11 adults with ADHD as well as sample of 17 clinicians experienced in the work with adults with ADHD were assessed fo further validation of the EFT Result The EFT was relatively easy to perform for both patients with ADHD and healthy comparison as shown by low error rates and non-significant group differences. However, simulatio groups differed from patients with ADHD by significant and large effects. An EFT inde for the prediction of feigned ADHD was derived based on logistic regression coefficients Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) demonstrated good classification accuracy o feigned ADHD relative to ADHD (AUC = 94.8%), i.e. high sensitivity (88%) and specificit (90%) ConclusionsThis study supports the utility of the EFT for the detection of feigned adult ADHD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Cognition", "Humans", "Intelligence Tests", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prognosis", "ROC Curve", "Self Report", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991480383", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55352593800": {"Name": "Fuermaier A.", "AuthorID": "55352593800", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen"}, "6603920871": {"Name": "Tucha O.", "AuthorID": "6603920871", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen"}, "36952656200": {"Name": "Koerts J.", "AuthorID": "36952656200", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen"}, "57191545291": {"Name": "Grabski M.", "AuthorID": "57191545291", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen"}, "23393588400": {"Name": "Tucha L.", "AuthorID": "23393588400", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen"}, "7202647336": {"Name": "Lange K.", "AuthorID": "7202647336", "AffiliationID": "60030807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Regensburg"}, "7003679476": {"Name": "Weisbrod M.", "AuthorID": "7003679476", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Section for Experimental Psychopathology and Neurophysiology, Centre for Psychosocial Medicine, University of Heidelberg"}, "6507518566": {"Name": "Aschenbrenner S.", "AuthorID": "6507518566", "AffiliationID": "60030356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology and Neuropsychology, SRH Clinic Karlsbad-Langensteinbach"}}}
