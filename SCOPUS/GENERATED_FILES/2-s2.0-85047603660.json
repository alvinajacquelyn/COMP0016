Here we demonstrate that distinct ON and OFF frequency tuning is largely absent in immature mouse auditory cortex and is thus a consequence of cortical development. Simulations using a novel implementation of a standard Hebbian plasticity model show that the natural alternation of sound onset and offset is sufficient for the formation of non-overlapping adjacent ON and OFF RFs in cortical neurons. Our model predicts that ON/OFF RF arrangement contributes towards direction selectivity to frequency-modulated tone sweeps, which we confirm by neuronal recordings. These data reveal that a simple and universally accepted learning rule can explain the organisation of ON and OFF RFs and direction selectivity in the developing auditory cortex.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Action Potentials", "Animals", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Perception", "Brain Mapping", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Learning", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Reaction Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047603660", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55308098400": {"Name": "Sollini J.", "AuthorID": "55308098400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57200090334": {"Name": "Chapuis G.", "AuthorID": "57200090334", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "16241056400": {"Name": "Clopath C.", "AuthorID": "16241056400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "6507025257": {"Name": "Chadderton P.", "AuthorID": "6507025257", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Bristol"}}}
