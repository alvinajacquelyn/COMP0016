The current study relates PSM to decisions on whether or not to collaborate, while controlling for the Big Six personality traits. Empirical evidence is gathered by means of an experimental design based on three different prisoner's dilemma games. Results indicate that PSM affects collaboration when the individual decides to collaborate or not as a first mover, before knowing what the counterpart decides, and as a second player provided that the counterpart has decided not to collaborate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931426814", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"54899511900": {"Name": "Esteve M.", "AuthorID": "54899511900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603825267": {"Name": "van Witteloostuijn A.", "AuthorID": "6603825267", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "University of Antwerp"}, "7004356569": {"Name": "Boyne G.", "AuthorID": "7004356569", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University"}}}
