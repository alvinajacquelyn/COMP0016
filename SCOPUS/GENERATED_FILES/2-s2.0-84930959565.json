We show here that inactivating mutations decouple this proton transfer step from the phosphate cleavage reaction in dUTPase. Homotrimeric dUTPase enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, using largely similar structural and functional groups as most AAA+ enzymes. dUTPases typically use a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion as a cofactor in the active site that is formed by direct protein-protein contacts including all three protomers. Here we focus on the C-terminal arm structural motif, which has sequence and functional similarities to P-loop motifs and is required for catalysis. In this work, we have studied the functional roles of the C-terminal arm in ligand binding and catalysis by using QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis experiments. We also present a new method to assess the metal ion coordination symmetry during the catalytic reaction. Using this new implementation, we identified that the coordination symmetry follows a consistent pattern in the three systems studied, reaching the most symmetrical state near the transition states. We found that the phosphate cleavage proceeds with a concerted bimolecular (A<inf>N</inf>D<inf>N</inf>) mechanism with a loose dissociative transition state and that it is coupled with a proton transfer step involving a unanimously conserved Asp residue. We show that the main mechanistic effect of the lack of the C-terminal arm is to decouple the phosphate cleavage from the subsequent proton transfer step, resulting in a high-barrier altered reaction pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ab initio", "continuous symmetry measure", "coupled proton transfer", "DFT (density functional theory)", "dUTPase", "one-metal ion catalytic mechanism", "QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio", "Catalytic mechanisms", "Continuous symmetry", "DFT (density functional theory)", "dUTPase", "Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930959565", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36150950700": {"Name": "Lopata A.", "AuthorID": "36150950700", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60001296, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "35386742300": {"Name": "Toth J.", "AuthorID": "35386742300", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60001296, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7004513602": {"Name": "Vertessy B.G.", "AuthorID": "7004513602", "AffiliationID": "60030035", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biotechnology and Food Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics"}, "26022381300": {"Name": "Jambrina P.G.", "AuthorID": "26022381300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kings College London"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kings College London"}, "8664891400": {"Name": "Sharma P.K.", "AuthorID": "8664891400", "AffiliationID": "60001018", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University"}, "7201573094": {"Name": "Brooks B.R.", "AuthorID": "7201573094", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Computational Biology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}}}
