Here, we induce Gaucher disease (GD), a rare inherited metabolic disorder, by injecting 15 inbred mouse strains with a low dose of a chemical inhibitor of acid \u03b2-glucosidase, the enzyme defective in GD. Different mouse strains exhibit widely different lifespans, which is unrelated to levels of acid \u03b2-glucosidase's substrate accumulation. Genome-wide association reveals a number of candidate risk loci, including a marker within Grin2b, which in combination with another marker allows us to predict the lifespan of additional mouse strains. An antagonist of the NMDA receptor (encoded by Grin2b) significantly increases the lifespan of GD mice that would otherwise have lived for a short time. Our data identify putative modifier genes that may be involved in determining GD severity, which might help elucidate phenotypic variability between patients with similar GD mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gaucher Disease", "Genes, Modifier", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Injections", "Inositol", "Longevity", "Mice, Inbred Strains", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006401138", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"46062217700": {"Name": "Klein A.", "AuthorID": "46062217700", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57188956827": {"Name": "Ferreira N.", "AuthorID": "57188956827", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "7005993343": {"Name": "Futerman A.", "AuthorID": "7005993343", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "22233392600": {"Name": "Ben-Dor S.", "AuthorID": "22233392600", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Services, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "36101138500": {"Name": "Duan J.", "AuthorID": "36101138500", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology and Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "7101966373": {"Name": "Merrill A.", "AuthorID": "7101966373", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology and Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "56577375300": {"Name": "Cox T.", "AuthorID": "56577375300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
