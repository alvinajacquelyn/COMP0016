The approach is that of translanguaging, which seeks to push the boundaries not only between different named languages but also between different modalities and across language scripts and writing systems. We base our arguments on a study of self-directed learning of Chinese via online platforms in the context of mobility and aim to demonstrate the transformative capacity of translanguaging. In doing so, we highlight the need for a transdisciplinary approach to language learning that transcends the boundaries between linguistics, psychology, and education, and in particular, the need to go beyond the artificial divides of the different modalities of language learning to strengthen the connections between research on bilingualism and multilingualism and research on language teaching and learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinese", "mobility", "multimodality", "online learning", "translanguaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054374682", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"7402951126": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "7402951126", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203042515": {"Name": "Ho W.", "AuthorID": "57203042515", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "City University of Hong Kong"}}}
