Having the possibility to recover geometrically consistent, volumetric images from scans acquired decades ago will enable more comprehensive, longitudinal studies to understand disease progressions. In this paper, we propose a consistent framework to reconstruct a volumetric representation from printed films holding thick single-slice brain MR image acquisitions dating back to the 1980's. We introduce a flexible framework based on semi-automatic slice extraction, followed by automated slice-to-volume registration with inter-slice transformation regularisation and slice intensity correction. Our algorithm is robust against numerous detrimental effects being present in archaic films. A subsequent, isotropic total variation deconvolution technique revitalises the visual appearance of the obtained volumes. We assess the accuracy and perform the validation of our reconstruction framework on a uniquely long-term MRI dataset where a ground-truth is available. This method will be used to facilitate a robust longitudinal analysis spanning 30 years of MRI scans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain MRI", "Historical MR film data", "Longitudinal analysis", "Regularized image registration", "Total variation reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Brain", "Datasets as Topic", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "X-Ray Film"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032334363", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57193152354": {"Name": "Ebner M.", "AuthorID": "57193152354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group (TIG), Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group (TIG), Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "57196236511": {"Name": "Chung K.K.", "AuthorID": "57196236511", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC)"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.T.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC)"}}}
