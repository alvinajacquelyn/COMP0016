Objectives: To assess the probability of prodromal PD in an older population and investigate its possible association with Mediterranean diet adherence. Methods: Data from a population-based cohort study of older adults (HEllenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet) in Greece were used. Probability of prodromal PD was calculated according to International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society research criteria. A detailed food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate dietary intake and calculate Mediterranean diet adherence score, ranging from 0 to 55, with higher scores indicating higher adherence. Results: Median probability of prodromal PD was 1.9%, ranging from 0.2 to 96.7% in 1,731 PD-free individuals aged \u2265 65 (41% male). Lower probability for prodromal PD (P < 0.001) in the higher Mediterranean diet adherence groups was noted, driven mostly by nonmotor markers of prodromal PD, depression, constipation, urinary dysfunction, and daytime somnolence. Each unit increase in Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 2% decreased probability for prodromal PD (P < 0.001). Compared to participants in the lowest quartile of Mediterranean diet adherence, those in the highest quartile were associated with a \u223c21% lower probability for prodromal PD. Conclusions: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower probability of prodromal PD in older people. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential causality of this association, potential relation of the Mediterranean diet to delayed onset or lower incidence of PD, as well as the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elderly", "Mediterranean", "neurodegeneration", "nutrition", "prodromal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Constipation", "Depression", "Diet, Mediterranean", "Female", "Greece", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Treatment Adherence and Compliance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054700425", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26645069400": {"Name": "Maraki M.", "AuthorID": "26645069400", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Harokopio University"}, "6602908270": {"Name": "Yannakoulia M.", "AuthorID": "6602908270", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Harokopio University"}, "8666179700": {"Name": "Anastasiou C.", "AuthorID": "8666179700", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Aiginition Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Aiginition Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "6701754861": {"Name": "Scarmeas N.", "AuthorID": "6701754861", "AffiliationID": "60014211, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, The Gertrude H.
