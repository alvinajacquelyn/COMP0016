Today there are three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid-\u03b2 consisting of 42 amino acids (A\u03b242), total-tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), which combined have sensitivity and specificity figures around 80%. However, pathological studies have shown that comorbidity is a common feature in AD and that the three currently used CSF biomarkers do not optimally reflect the activity of the disease process. Thus, additional markers are needed. Areas covered: In the present review, we screened PubMed for articles published the last five years (2012\u20132017) for proteomic studies in CSF with the criteria that AD had to be included as one of the diagnostic groups. Based on inclusion criteria, 28 papers were included reporting in total 224 biomarker-data that were altered in AD compared to control. Both mass spectrometry and multi-panel immunoassays were considered as proteomic studies. Expert commentary: A large number of pilot studies have been reported but so far there is a lack of replicated findings and to date no CSF biomarker discovered in proteomic studies has reached the clinic to aid in the diagnostic work-up of patients with cognitive impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Biomarker", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Immunoassays", "Mass spectrometry", "Proteomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Mass Spectrometry", "Proteomics", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045832484", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6602971570": {"Name": "Brinkmalm G.", "AuthorID": "6602971570", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "36574061600": {"Name": "Pannee J.", "AuthorID": "36574061600", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "55835183800": {"Name": "Dahl\u00e9n R.", "AuthorID": "55835183800", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6603361018": {"Name": "Brinkmalm A.", "AuthorID": "6603361018", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6603847526": {"Name": "Gobom J.", "AuthorID": "6603847526", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
