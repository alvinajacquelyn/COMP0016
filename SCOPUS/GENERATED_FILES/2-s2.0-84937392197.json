In other forms of hypersensitivity, HLA risk alleles have not been identified and T cells are activated in an allele unrestricted manner. Chemically reactive drug metabolites bind to multiple proteins; thus, it is assumed that the derived peptide antigens interact with a number of HLA molecules to activate T cells; however, HLA restriction of the drug metabolite-specific T-cell response has not been studied. Objective: To utilize T cells from sulfamethoxazole (SMX) hypersensitive patients with cystic fibrosis to examine the HLA molecules that interact with nitroso SMX (SMX-NO)-derived antigens. Methods: T-cell clones were generated from 4 hypersensitive patients. Drug-specific proliferative responses and cytokine secretion were measured. Anti-human class I and class II antibodies were used to analyse HLA restriction. Antigen-presenting cells expressing different HLA molecules were used to determine the alleles involved in the presentation of SMX-NO-derived antigens to T cells. Results: A total of 976 clones were tested for SMX-NO reactivity. Thirty-nine CD4+ clones were activated with SMX-NO and found to proliferate and secrete cytokines. The SMX-NO-specific response was blocked with an antibody against HLA-DQ. SMX-NO-specific responses were detected with antigen-presenting cells expressing HLA-DQB1*05:01 (patient 1) and HLA-DQB1*02:01 (patient 2), but not other HLA-DQB1 alleles. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: HLA-DQ plays an important role in the activation of SMX-NO-specific CD4+ T cells. Detection of HLA-DQ allele-restricted responses suggests that T cells are activated by a limited repertoire of SMX-NO-modified peptides.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug hypersensitivity", "HLA-DQ", "Sulfamethoxazole", "T-cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Drug Hypersensitivity", "Female", "HLA-DQ beta-Chains", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Sulfamethoxazole"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937392197", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55389933200": {"Name": "Ogese M.O.", "AuthorID": "55389933200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "56097639000": {"Name": "Saide K.", "AuthorID": "56097639000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "7103404706": {"Name": "Faulkner L.", "AuthorID": "7103404706", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "6508330042": {"Name": "Alfirevic A.", "AuthorID": "6508330042", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.K.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "6603779088": {"Name": "Naisbitt D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603779088", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "26634614800": {"Name": "Whitaker P.", "AuthorID": "26634614800", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Regional Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit, St James's Hospital"}, "7005935206": {"Name": "Peckham D.", "AuthorID": "7005935206", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Regional Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit, St James's Hospital"}, "56603607200": {"Name": "Baker D.M.", "AuthorID": "56603607200", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla"}, "35418504700": {"Name": "Sette A.", "AuthorID": "35418504700", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla"}}}
