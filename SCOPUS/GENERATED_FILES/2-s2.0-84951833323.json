As lithium is inserted into the nanosized particles within the cathode, the electrochemical reaction can be largely affected by the interfacial chemistry at the nanoparticle surface. We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using both soft (XPS) and hard (HAXPES) X-rays to chemically distinguish and depth-resolve the interfacial phase transitions in \u03b5-VOPO4 electrodes as a function of electrochemical discharge. Our analysis shows that the second lithium reaction begins before the full incorporation of the first lithium. This results in a pronounced lithium gradient within the nanoparticles, with the \u03b5-Li2VOPO4 phase only forming near the surface. These results indicate that a disruption of the kinetics are limiting the realized capacity in our hydrothermally synthesized \u03b5-VOPO4. Moreover, from inspection of the valence band region, we were able to monitor the evolution of \u03b5-VOPO4 to \u03b5-Li2VOPO4 at the surface of our nanoparticles. These assignments are confirmed by hybrid density functional theory of the three end phases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cath-ode materials", "Electrochemical discharge", "Electrochemical reactions", "Hybrid density functional theory", "Hydrothermally synthesized", "Interfacial effects", "Nano-sized particles", "Nanoparticle surface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951833323", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55746184600": {"Name": "Quackenbush N.", "AuthorID": "55746184600", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Binghamton University"}, "56157335100": {"Name": "Wangoh L.", "AuthorID": "56157335100", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Binghamton University"}, "55509844500": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "55509844500", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Binghamton University"}, "8861646500": {"Name": "Piper L.", "AuthorID": "8861646500", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Binghamton University"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57194687922": {"Name": "Chung Y.", "AuthorID": "57194687922", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Northeast Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES), State University of New York at Binghamton"}, "57188839651": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57188839651", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University"}, "7005286854": {"Name": "Chernova N.", "AuthorID": "7005286854", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Northeast Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES), State University of New York at Binghamton"}, "8348104500": {"Name": "Whittingham M.", "AuthorID": "8348104500", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Northeast Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES), State University of New York at Binghamton"}, "55855803400": {"Name": "Wen B.", "AuthorID": "55855803400", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry and Materials, State University of New York at Binghamton"}, "57020102100": {"Name": "Lin Y.", "AuthorID": "57020102100", "AffiliationID": "60121662, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of NanoEngineering, University of California"}, "57203196608": {"Name": "Ong S.", "AuthorID": "57203196608", "AffiliationID": "60121662, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of NanoEngineering, University of California"}, "7003496332": {"Name": "Woicik J.", "AuthorID": "7003496332", "AffiliationID": "60007532, 60023053", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}}}
