The End-TB Strategy launched by the World Health Organization in the context of the post-2015 agenda aims to markedly abate the scourge of TB towards global elimination, by improving current diagnostic and therapeutic practices, promoting preventative interventions, stimulating government commitment and increased financing, and intensifying research and innovation. The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains is currently among the greatest concerns, which may hinder the achievement of future goals. It is crucial that primary healthcare providers are sufficiently familiar with the basic principles of TB diagnosis and care, to ensure early case detection and prompt referral to specialised centres for treatment initiation and follow-up. Given their special relationship with patients, they are in the best position to promote educational interventions and identify at-risk individuals as well as to improve adherence to treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Tuberculin Test", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994336806", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6507327565": {"Name": "Sulis G.", "AuthorID": "6507327565", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, WHO Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "7006442223": {"Name": "Matteelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006442223", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, WHO Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "6506479049": {"Name": "Centis R.", "AuthorID": "6506479049", "AffiliationID": "122071988", "AffiliationName": "WHO Collaborating Centre for TB and Lung Diseases, Maugeri Institute, IRCCS"}, "56582629500": {"Name": "D'Ambrosio L.", "AuthorID": "56582629500", "AffiliationID": "115748855", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Consulting Group"}, "7005608870": {"Name": "Migliori G.B.", "AuthorID": "7005608870", "AffiliationID": "122071988", "AffiliationName": "WHO Collaborating Centre for TB and Lung Diseases, Maugeri Institute, IRCCS"}, "57195236771": {"Name": "Sotgiu G.", "AuthorID": "57195236771", "AffiliationID": "60010110, 60108815", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Statistics Unit, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari - Research, Medical Education and Professional Development Unit, AOU Sassari"}, "57192934758": {"Name": "Pontali E.", "AuthorID": "57192934758", "AffiliationID": "60018618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Galliera Hospital"}, "6603926482": {"Name": "Spanevello A.", "AuthorID": "6603926482", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Insubria"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
