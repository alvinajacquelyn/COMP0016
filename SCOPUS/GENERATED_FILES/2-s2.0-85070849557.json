The extent to which this is justifiable is explored via a thorough X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis: spanning core levels, ionization potential, work function, surface contamination, cleaning, band alignment, and valence-band density of states. The XPS analysis overcomes and addresses the shortcomings of prior XPS studies of this material. Temperature-dependent absorption spectra determine a 1.2 eV direct band gap at room temperature; the widely reported 1.4-1.5 eV band gap is attributed to weak transitions from the low density of states of the topmost valence band previously being undetected. Density functional theory HSE06 + SOC calculations determine the band structure, optical transitions, and well-fitted absorption and Raman spectra. Valence band XPS spectra and model calculations find the CBS bonding to be superficially similar to CIGS and CZTS, but the Bi3+ cations (and formally occupied Bi 6s orbital) have fundamental impacts: giving a low ionization potential (4.98 eV), suggesting that the CdS window layer favored for CIGS and CZTS gives detrimental band alignment and should be rejected in favor of a better aligned material in order for CBS devices to progress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["band gap", "Cu3BiS3", "density functional theory", "ionization potential", "photoemission", "XPS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Copper indium gallium diselenide", "Copper zinc tin sulfides", "Cu3BiS3", "Photovoltaic property", "Surface contaminations", "Temperature dependent", "Valence-band densities", "X ray photoemission spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070849557", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56429533600": {"Name": "Whittles T.J.", "AuthorID": "56429533600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "6603739582": {"Name": "Veal T.D.", "AuthorID": "6603739582", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56973545700": {"Name": "Yates P.J.", "AuthorID": "56973545700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "57191377780": {"Name": "Murgatroyd P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57191377780", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "57193028021": {"Name": "Gibbon J.T.", "AuthorID": "57193028021", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56311857400": {"Name": "Birkett M.", "AuthorID": "56311857400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "16239220700": {"Name": "Major J.D.", "AuthorID": "16239220700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56216953800": {"Name": "Durose K.", "AuthorID": "56216953800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "7005578699": {"Name": "Dhanak V.R.", "AuthorID": "7005578699", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.N.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "7202993130": {"Name": "Potter R.J.", "AuthorID": "7202993130", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}}}
