This extends our previous work for N = 2 (Cotar etal. in Commun Pure Appl Math 66:548\u2013599, 2013). The correct limit problem has been derived in the physics literature by Seidl (Phys Rev A 60 4387\u20134395, 1999) and Seidl, Gorigiorgi and Savin (Phys Rev A 75:042511 1-12, 2007); in these papers the lack of a rigorous proofwas pointed out.We also give amathematical counterexample to this type of result, by replacing the constraint of given one-body density\u2014an infinite dimensional quadratic expression in the wavefunction\u2014by an infinite-dimensional quadratic expression in the wavefunction and its gradient.
