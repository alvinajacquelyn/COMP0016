Children born prior to 29 weeks of gestational age had been entered into a randomised trial of two methods of neonatal ventilation (United Kingdom Oscillation Study). They had comprehensive lung function measurements at 11 to 14 years of age. One hundred and seventy-nine children born at a mean gestational age of 26.9 (range 23\u201328) weeks were assessed at 11 to 14 years; 50 had received postnatal dexamethasone. Forced expiratory flow at 75% (FEF75), 50%, 25% and 25\u201375% of the expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity and lung volumes including total lung capacity and residual volume were assessed. Lung function outcomes were compared between children who had and had not been exposed to dexamethasone after adjustment for neonatal factors using linear mixed effects regression. After adjustment for confounders all the mean spirometry results were between 0.38 and 0.87 standard deviations lower in those exposed to dexamethasone compared to the unexposed. For example, the mean FEF75 z-score was 0.53 lower (95% CI 0.21 to 0.85). The mean lung function was lower as the number of courses of dexamethasone increased. In conclusion, postnatal dexamethasone exposure was associated with lower mean lung function at school age in children born extremely prematurely. Our results suggest the larger the cumulative dose the greater the adverse effect on lung function at follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia", "Child", "Dexamethasone", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Lung", "Male", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Treatment Outcome", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049564865", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57190223661": {"Name": "Harris C.", "AuthorID": "57190223661", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women and Children\u2019s Health, School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "56073692600": {"Name": "Zivanovic S.", "AuthorID": "56073692600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women and Children\u2019s Health, School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "26027067200": {"Name": "Lunt A.", "AuthorID": "26027067200", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women and Children\u2019s Health, School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "55085707900": {"Name": "Greenough A.", "AuthorID": "55085707900", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "34067584300": {"Name": "Crichton S.", "AuthorID": "34067584300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "35548124700": {"Name": "Peacock J.L.", "AuthorID": "35548124700", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "57213449631": {"Name": "Calvert S.", "AuthorID": "57213449631", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Health, St George\u2019s Hospital"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Medicine, University College"}}}
