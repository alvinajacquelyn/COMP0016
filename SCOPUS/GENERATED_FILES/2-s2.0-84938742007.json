On the basis of the most up-to-date meta-analysis of experimental studies indicating that media-idealized images have the most harmful and substantial impact on vulnerable individuals regardless of gender (i.e., \u201cinternalizers\u201d and \u201cself-objectifiers\u201d), the current longitudinal study examined the direct and mediated links posited in objectification theory among media-ideal internalization, self-objectification, shame and anxiety surrounding the body and appearance, dietary restraint, and binge eating. Data collected from 685 adolescents aged between 14 and 15 at baseline (47 % males), who were interviewed and completed standardized measures annually over a 3-year period, were analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach. Results indicated that media-ideal internalization predicted later thinking and scrutinizing of one\u2019s body from an external observer\u2019s standpoint (or self-objectification), which then predicted later negative emotional experiences related to one\u2019s body and appearance. In turn, these negative emotional experiences predicted subsequent dietary restraint and binge eating, and each of these core features of eating disorders influenced each other. Differences in the strength of these associations across gender were not observed, and all indirect effects were significant. The study provides valuable information about how the cultural values embodied by gendered beauty ideals negatively influence adolescents\u2019 feelings, thoughts and behaviors regarding their own body, and on the complex processes involved in disordered eating. Practical implications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Binge eating", "Body image", "Media-ideal internalization", "Objectification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Advertising as Topic", "Binge-Eating Disorder", "Body Image", "Bulimia", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Gender Identity", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mass Media", "Self Concept", "Shame", "Social Values", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938742007", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55366742000": {"Name": "Dakanalis A.", "AuthorID": "55366742000", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "56470353500": {"Name": "Zanetti M.A.", "AuthorID": "56470353500", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College"}, "14059513700": {"Name": "Calogero R.", "AuthorID": "14059513700", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "23469112400": {"Name": "Fida R.", "AuthorID": "23469112400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Biomedical Technologies, University of Milano-Bicocca, Medical School"}, "56962750600": {"Name": "Riva G.", "AuthorID": "56962750600", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Applied Technology for Neuro-Psychology Laboratory, Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS"}}}
