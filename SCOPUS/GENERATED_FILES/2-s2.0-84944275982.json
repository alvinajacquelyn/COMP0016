However, most research on how attention is deployed is conducted with two dimensional (2D) computer displays, leaving a large gap in our understanding about the deployment of attention in 3D space. We report how each of four parameters of 3D visual space influence visual search: 3D display volume, distance in depth, number of depth planes, and relative target position in depth. Using a search task, we find that visual search performance depends on 3D volume, relative target position in depth, and number of depth planes. Our results demonstrate an asymmetrical preference for targets in the front of a display unique to 3D search and show that arranging items into more depth planes reduces search efficiency. Consistent with research using 2D displays, we found slower response times to find targets in displays with larger 3D volumes compared with smaller 3D volumes. Finally, in contrast to the importance of target depth relative to other distractors, target depth relative to the fixation point did not affect response times or search efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D attention", "Depth", "Feature-based attention", "Search efficiency", "Spatial attention", "Visual search"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Depth Perception", "Humans", "Reaction Time", "Spatial Processing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944275982", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"55354190100": {"Name": "Finlayson N.", "AuthorID": "55354190100", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University"}, "6701491981": {"Name": "Grove P.", "AuthorID": "6701491981", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}}}
