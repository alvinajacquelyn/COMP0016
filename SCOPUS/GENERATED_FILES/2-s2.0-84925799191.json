All rights reserved.The structure of messenger RNA is important for post-transcriptional regulation, mainly because it affects binding of trans-acting factors. However, little is known about the in vivo structure of full-length mRNAs. Here we present hiCLIP, a biochemical technique for transcriptome-wide identification of RNA secondary structures interacting with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Using this technique to investigate RNA structures bound by Staufen 1 (STAU1) in human cells, we uncover a dominance of intra-molecular RNA duplexes, a depletion of duplexes from coding regions of highly translated mRNAs, an unexpected prevalence of long-range duplexes in 3'2 untranslated regions (UTRs), and a decreased incidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in duplex-forming regions. We also discover a duplex spanning 858 nucleotides in the 3'2 UTR of the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA that regulates its cytoplasmic splicing and stability. Our study reveals the fundamental role of mRNA secondary structures in gene expression and introduces hiCLIP as a widely applicable method for discovering new, especially long-range, RNA duplexes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Base Sequence", "Cytoplasm", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors", "RNA Splicing", "RNA Stability", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "X-Box Binding Protein 1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925799191", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55792988600": {"Name": "Sugimoto Y.", "AuthorID": "55792988600", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "36911077800": {"Name": "D'Ambrogio A.", "AuthorID": "36911077800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55032344700": {"Name": "Zirra A.", "AuthorID": "55032344700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "23987569100": {"Name": "Militti C.", "AuthorID": "23987569100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "23986539100": {"Name": "Vigilante A.", "AuthorID": "23986539100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "24343757900": {"Name": "Darbo E.", "AuthorID": "24343757900", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK London Research Institute"}, "6701608432": {"Name": "Luscombe N.", "AuthorID": "6701608432", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"}}}
