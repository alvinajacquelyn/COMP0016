All rights reserved.When faced with high frequency streams of data, clustering raises theoretical and algorithmic pitfalls. We introduce a new and adaptive online clustering algorithm relying on a quasi-Bayesian approach, with a dynamic (i.e., time-dependent) estimation of the (unknown and changing) number of clusters. We prove that our approach is supported by minimax regret bounds. We also provide an RJMCMC-flavored implementation (called PACBO, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PACBO/index.html) for which we give a convergence guarantee. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate the potential of our procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Minimax regret bounds", "Online clustering", "Quasi-Bayesian learning", "Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053883800", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"57221561273": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "57221561273", "AffiliationID": "60012772", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Angers and iAdvize"}, "23388770500": {"Name": "Guedj B.", "AuthorID": "23388770500", "AffiliationID": "60013373", "AffiliationName": "Inria, Lille - Nord Europe research center"}, "24503273900": {"Name": "Loustau S.", "AuthorID": "24503273900", "AffiliationID": "121390341", "AffiliationName": "LumenAI"}}}
