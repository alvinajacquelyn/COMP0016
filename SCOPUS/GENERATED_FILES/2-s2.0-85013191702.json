These studies have increased our understanding of epigenetic events underlying carcinogenesis and have enabled the discovery of cancer-specific methylation biomarkers. In this mini-review, we have focused on the state of the art in EWAS applied to cell-free circulating DNA for epigenetic biomarker discovery in cancer and discussed associated technical advances and challenges, and our expectations for the future of the field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Cell-Free Nucleic Acids", "Epigenomics", "Genome, Human", "Genomics", "Humans", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013191702", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"54584546700": {"Name": "Tani\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "54584546700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
