This is a much richer representation than a single image, and has many applications in cultural heritage for the digitising and display of objects that are flattish with surface relief, such as coins, medals, fossils, rock art, incised tablets, bas reliefs, engravings, canvas paintings, etc. The image sets can be used in three ways: (1) visualisation by interactive movement of a virtual light source over the enclosing hemisphere; (2) 3D reconstruction of the object surface; (3) modelling of the specular highlights from the surface and hence realistic rendering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Illumination", "Specular model", "Surface normals"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Canvas paintings", "Cultural heritages", "Illumination system", "Realistic rendering", "Specular highlight", "Surface normals", "Surface reliefs"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923558991", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"7103387453": {"Name": "MacDonald L.", "AuthorID": "7103387453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "3D Impact Research Group, University College London"}}}
