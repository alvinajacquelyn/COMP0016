The mechanisms that regulate this spatiotemporal pattern are unknown. In vivo imaging in zebrafish reveals that differentiating spinal neurons transiently extend two long protrusions along the basal surface of the spinal cord before axon initiation. These protrusions express Delta protein, consistent with the hypothesis they influence Notch signaling at a distance of several cell diameters. Experimental reduction of Laminin expression leads to smaller protrusions and shorter distances between differentiating neurons. The experimental data and a theoretical model support the proposal that neuronal differentiation pattern is regulated by transient basal protrusions that deliver temporally controlled lateral inhibition mediated at a distance. This work uncovers a stereotyped protrusive activity of newborn neurons that organize long-distance spatiotemporal patterning of differentiation. Lateral inhibition mediated by Delta-Notch signaling is thought to operate at short range between neighboring cells. Hadjivasiliou et al. show that transient protrusions up to 100 \u03bcm long from differentiating neurons extend the range of lateral inhibition and regulate spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal differentiation along the spinal cord.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basal protrusions", "lateral inhibition", "live imaging", "neuronal differentiation", "spatiotemporal pattern", "spinal cord", "zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Body Patterning", "Cell Communication", "Cell Differentiation", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Laminin", "Membrane Proteins", "Motor Neurons", "Neurogenesis", "Signal Transduction", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis", "Spinal Cord", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066785517", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55130612500": {"Name": "Hadjivasiliou Z.", "AuthorID": "55130612500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "57199008759": {"Name": "Moore R.", "AuthorID": "57199008759", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57193570383": {"Name": "McIntosh R.", "AuthorID": "57193570383", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "7403197213": {"Name": "Clarke J.", "AuthorID": "7403197213", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "37026041900": {"Name": "Galea G.", "AuthorID": "37026041900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "14324228500": {"Name": "Alexandre P.", "AuthorID": "14324228500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}}}
