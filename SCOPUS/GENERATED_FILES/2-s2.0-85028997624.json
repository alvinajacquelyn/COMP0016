Methods: Data came from the U.K. Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development, with prospective childhood social risk factor data collected in 1950 to 1957 and retrospectively in 1989. Physical capability and common affective symptom data were collected in 2006 to 2011. Results: The cumulative risk approach and factor analysis provided evidence that children who were exposed to multiple social risk factors had lower levels of physical capability and more symptoms of common affective symptoms in later life. Discussion: The cumulative social risk approach and the use of factor analysis to identify contexts of social risk, may offer viable methods for linking multiple childhood social risk exposure to aging outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["childhood social risk factors", "common affective symptoms", "life course", "physical capability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events", "Adverse Childhood Experiences", "Affective Symptoms", "Aged", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Life History Traits", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028997624", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"55421334900": {"Name": "Caleyachetty R.", "AuthorID": "55421334900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "35354537000": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "35354537000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7005374676": {"Name": "Stafford M.", "AuthorID": "7005374676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "14630195700": {"Name": "Howe L.D.", "AuthorID": "14630195700", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "55576669200": {"Name": "Anderson E.", "AuthorID": "55576669200", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}}}
