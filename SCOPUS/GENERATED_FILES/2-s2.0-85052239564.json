Drawing on a life course approach that considers stability and change in employment patterns, this study examines the relationship between long-term labour market involvement in later life and self-rated health. Methods: Our data are from the Health and Retirement Study (1992\u20132012) for the cohort born 1931\u20131941 (N = 6522). We used optimal matching analysis to map employment trajectories from ages 52\u201369, and then logistic regression to examine associations between these trajectories and self-rated health in the early 70s, net of socio-demographics, household resources and prior health. Findings: Women prevail in groups characterized by a weak(er) attachment to the labour market and men, in groups signifying a strong(er) attachment. Men who downshifted from full-time to part-time work around age 65 were the least likely to report poor health in their early 70s.Women had the best health if they remained employed, either full-time or part-time. However, unlike men, they appeared to benefit most in health terms when part-time hours were part of a longer-term pattern. Conclusion: While our study findings show that continuing to work in later life may be positively associated with health, they also suggest the need for flexible employment policies that foster opportunities to work part-time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Employment trajectories", "Gender", "Life course", "Optimal matching", "Self-rated health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052239564", "SubjectAreas": [["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"7202803142": {"Name": "McDonough P.", "AuthorID": "7202803142", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "57203548208": {"Name": "Worts D.", "AuthorID": "57203548208", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "10241341900": {"Name": "Corna L.", "AuthorID": "10241341900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Health & Medicine, Institute of Gerontology, King's College London"}, "6507035657": {"Name": "McMunn A.", "AuthorID": "6507035657", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099295, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London, ESRC International Centre for Life Course Studies in Society & Health"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099295, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London, ESRC International Centre for Life Course Studies in Society & Health"}}}
