Drawing on fieldwork in Delhi and Mumbai, this paper explores how police investigations unfolded in the specific context of women's deaths by burning in India. In particular, it focuses on the use of discretion despite its denial by those exercising it. In India, there are distinctive statutes relating to women's suspicious deaths, reflecting the widespread expectation that the bride's family will pay a dowry to the groom's family and the tensions to which this may on occasion give rise in the early years of a marriage. Often, there are conflicting claims influencing how the woman's death is classified. These in turn affect police investigation. The nature and direction of police discretion in investigating women's deaths by burning reflect in part the unique nature of the legislation and the particular sensitivities in relation to these types of death. They also highlight processes that are liable to be at work in any crime investigation. It was found that police officers exercised unacknowledged discretion at seven specific points in the investigative process, with potentially significant consequences for the achievement of just outcomes: first response, recording the victim's \u2018dying declaration\u2019, inquest, registering of the \u2018First Information Report\u2019, collecting evidence, arrest and framing of the charges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["burns", "dowry death", "India", "medico-legal", "police discretion", "police investigation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938416120", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"26532370500": {"Name": "Belur J.", "AuthorID": "26532370500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "6602765847": {"Name": "Tilley N.", "AuthorID": "6602765847", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "30267514600": {"Name": "Daruwalla N.", "AuthorID": "30267514600", "AffiliationID": "108109655", "AffiliationName": "Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action, Urban Health Centre"}, "14041918600": {"Name": "Kumar M.", "AuthorID": "14041918600", "AffiliationID": "60001139", "AffiliationName": "Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital"}, "35476754400": {"Name": "Tiwari V.", "AuthorID": "35476754400", "AffiliationID": "60016396", "AffiliationName": "Department of Burns, Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, VM Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital"}}}
