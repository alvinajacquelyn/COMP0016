Health Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This paper investigates the economic impact of health shocks on working-age adults in Vietnam during 2004-2008, using a fixed effects specification. Health shocks cover disability and morbidity and are measured by 'days unable to carry out regular activity', 'days in bed due to illness/injury', and 'hospitalization'. Overall, Vietnamese households are able to smooth total non-health expenditures in the short run in the face of a significant rise in out-of-pocket health expenditures. However, this is accomplished through vulnerability-enhancing mechanisms, especially in rural areas, including increased loans and asset sales and decreased education expenditures. Female-headed and rural households are found to be the least able to protect consumption. Results highlight the need to extend and deepen social protection and universal health coverage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coping mechanisms", "disability", "expenditures", "health shocks", "morbidity", "Vietnam"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Cost of Illness", "Disabled Persons", "Empirical Research", "Employment", "Family Characteristics", "Financing, Personal", "Health Expenditures", "Health Status", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Mortality", "Poverty", "Rural Population", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vietnam"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930319735", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"15027137800": {"Name": "Mitra S.", "AuthorID": "15027137800", "AffiliationID": "60015095", "AffiliationName": "Fordham University"}, "36915641500": {"Name": "Palmer M.", "AuthorID": "36915641500", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "57203015771": {"Name": "Mont D.", "AuthorID": "57203015771", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London"}, "57204340273": {"Name": "Groce N.", "AuthorID": "57204340273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London"}}}
