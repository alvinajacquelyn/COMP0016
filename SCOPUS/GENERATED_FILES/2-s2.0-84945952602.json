This is inspired by the relation R=-T+B between the Ricci scalar of general relativity and the torsion of teleparallel gravity. This theory in suitable limits incorporates both the nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to torsion, and the nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to the Ricci scalar. We analyze the cosmology of such models, and we perform a dynamical systems analysis on the case when we have only a pure coupling to the boundary term. It is found that the system generically evolves to a late time accelerating attractor solution without requiring any fine-tuning of the parameters. A dynamical crossing of the phantom barrier is also shown to be possible.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945952602", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
