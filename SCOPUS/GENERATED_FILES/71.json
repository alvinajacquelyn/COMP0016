    "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2014.Background. Schizotypy is a complex concept, commonly defined as a genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia that falls on a continuum between healthy variation and severe mental illness. There is a growing body of evidence supporting an association between childhood trauma and increased psychotic experiences and disorders. However, the evidence as to whether there is a similar association with schizotypy has yet to be systematically synthesized and assessed. Method. We conducted a systematic search of published articles on the association between childhood trauma and schizotypy in four major databases. The search covered articles from 1806 to 1 March 2013 and resulted in 17 003 articles in total. Twenty-five original research studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Results. All 25 studies supported the association between at least one type of trauma and schizotypy, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging between 2.01 and 4.15. There was evidence supporting the association for all types of trauma, with no differential effects. However, there was some variability in the quality of the studies, with most using cross-sectional designs. Individuals who reported adverse experiences in childhood scored significantly higher on positive and negative/disorganized schizotypy compared to those who did not report such experiences. Conclusions. All forms of childhood trauma and other stressful events (e.g. bullying) were found to be associated with schizotypy, with especially strong associations with positive schizotypy. However, because of the methodological limitations of several studies and a lack of further exploration of different possible mechanistic pathways underlying this association, more research is required.",
