The problem of proactive content replication in hierarchical cache networks, which consist of both network edge and core network caches, is considered in this paper. This problem arises because network service providers wish to efficiently distribute content so that user-perceived performance is maximized. Nevertheless, current high-complexity replication algorithms are impractical due to the vast number of involved content items. Clustering algorithms inspired from machine learning can be leveraged to simplify content replication and reduce its complexity. Specifically, similar items could be clustered together, e.g., according to their popularity in space and time. Replication on a cluster-level is a problem of substantially smaller dimensionality, but it may result in suboptimal decisions compared to item-level replication. The factors that cause performance loss are identified and a clustering scheme that addresses the specific challenges of content replication is devised. Extensive numerical evaluations, based on realistic traffic data, demonstrate that for reasonable cluster sizes the impact on actual performance is negligible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cache", "clustering", "content replication", "Radio Access Network"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953791921", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35172812900": {"Name": "Gkatzikis L.", "AuthorID": "35172812900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Huawei"}, "15726695000": {"Name": "Sourlas V.", "AuthorID": "15726695000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "55957727100": {"Name": "Fischione C.", "AuthorID": "55957727100", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "KTH"}, "8868585200": {"Name": "Dan G.", "AuthorID": "8868585200", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "KTH"}, "6603369548": {"Name": "Koutsopoulos I.", "AuthorID": "6603369548", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "AUEB and CERTH"}}}
