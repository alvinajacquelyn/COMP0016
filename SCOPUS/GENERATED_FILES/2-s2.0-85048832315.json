Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) via a double cone coil over the tibialis anterior (TA) motor area during weak isometric dorsiflexion of the foot was used on two different days in random order; pre/post spinal manipulation (in eighteen subjects) and pre/post a control (in twelve subjects) condition. TA electromyography (EMG) was recorded with surface and intramuscular fine wire electrodes. Three subjects also received sham double cone coil TMS pre and post a spinal manipulation intervention. From the averaged surface EMG data cortical silent periods (CSP) were constructed and analysed. Twenty-one single motor units were identified for the spinal manipulation intervention and twelve single motor units were identified for the control intervention. Following spinal manipulations there was a shortening of the silent period and an increase in the single unit I-wave amplitude. No changes were observed following the control condition. The results provide evidence that spinal manipulation reduces the TMS-induced cortical silent period and increases low threshold motoneurone excitability in the lower limb muscle. These finding may have important clinical implications as they provide support that spinal manipulation can be used to strengthen muscles. This could be followed up on populations that have reduced muscle strength, such as stroke victims.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chiropractic", "Cortical silent period", "Motor cortex", "Sensorimotor integration", "Single motor unit", "Spinal manipulation", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Manipulation, Chiropractic", "Manipulation, Spinal", "Motor Cortex", "Motor Neurons", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048832315", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36991856100": {"Name": "Haavik H.", "AuthorID": "36991856100", "AffiliationID": "100438644", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chiropractic Research, New Zealand College of Chiropractic"}, "56658453700": {"Name": "Niazi I.", "AuthorID": "56658453700", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Health & Rehabilitation Research Institute, Auckland University of Technology"}, "56562921900": {"Name": "Navid M.", "AuthorID": "56562921900", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "SMI, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University"}, "55540332200": {"Name": "Jochumsen M.", "AuthorID": "55540332200", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "SMI, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University"}, "14820153100": {"Name": "Ugin\u010dius P.", "AuthorID": "14820153100", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "55413634800": {"Name": "Sebik O.", "AuthorID": "55413634800", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "56267470600": {"Name": "Y\u0131lmaz G.", "AuthorID": "56267470600", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "56529237700": {"Name": "\u00d6zyurt M.", "AuthorID": "56529237700", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "7005874092": {"Name": "T\u00fcrker K.", "AuthorID": "7005874092", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Ko\u00e7 University"}}}
