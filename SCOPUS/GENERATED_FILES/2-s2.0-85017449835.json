We defined the compensating variation (CV) of child disability as the amount of additional income a family with a disabled child would require to achieve the same living standards as a similar family without a disabled child. The aims of this study were to estimate the CV for child disability and to explore how this varied for different levels of disability and reference levels of living standards. Using data on 54,641 families from the Family Resources Survey (2004\u20132012), we matched families with (cases) and without (controls) a disabled child on family and child characteristics plus living standards and calculated the income difference inclusive of disability benefits. Our findings suggest that across families with the most disabled children, a compensating variation equal to an extra \u00a356\u2013\u00a379 a week was required to achieve the same living standards as matched families without a disabled child compared with the mean level of state disability benefit \u00a347\u2013\u00a371 a week in this group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child disability", "Compensating variation", "Living standards", "Matching"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "Disabled Children", "Disabled Persons", "Family Health", "Humans", "Income", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017449835", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57192157442": {"Name": "Melnychuk M.", "AuthorID": "57192157442", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "55263597100": {"Name": "Solmi F.", "AuthorID": "55263597100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
