It is to convince the scientific community to adopt and implement a new philosophy of science that does better justice to the deeply problematic basic intellectual aims of science than that which we have at present. Problematic aims evolve with evolving knowledge, that part of philosophy of science concerned with aims and methods thus becoming an integral part of science itself. The outcome of putting this new philosophy into scientific practice would be a new kind of science, both more intellectually rigorous and one that does better justice to the best interests of humanity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aim-oriented empiricism", "metaphysics of science", "natural philosophy", "philosophy of science", "physicalism", "physics", "problematic aims of science", "revolution for philosophy of science", "revolution for science", "scientific progress", "standard empiricism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062791290", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"7004686297": {"Name": "Maxwell N.", "AuthorID": "7004686297", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
