Drawing on recent work by Wilson and Sperber (Explaining irony: 123-145, 2012a) and Wilson (J Pragmat 59: 40-56, 2013), I will argue that these phenomena are not inherently ironical, display none of the distinctive features of irony in most of their uses, and should not be seen as falling within the scope of an explanatory theory of irony.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Banter", "Echoing", "Hyperbole", "Irony", "Jokes", "Pretence", "Relevance theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034256362", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"14066846800": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "14066846800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Linguistics"}}}
