Here, we seek to explain a long-wavelength pattern of shear wave anisotropy observed in anisotropic tomography where vertically polarised shear waves travel faster than horizontally polarised shear waves in the central Pacific and under Africa but this pattern is reversed elsewhere. In particular, we test an explanation derived from experiments on analogues, which suggest that texture may be inherited during phase transitions between bridgmanite (perovskite structured MgSiO3) and post-perovskite, and that such texture inheritance may yield the long-wavelength pattern of anisotropy. We find that models that include this effect correlate better with tomographic models than those that assume deformation due to a single phase in the lowermost mantle, supporting the idea that texture inheritance is an important factor in understanding lowermost mantle anisotropy. It is possible that anisotropy could be used to map the post-perovskite stability field in the lowermost mantle, and thus place constraints on the temperature structure above the core-mantle boundary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lowermost mantle", "Mantle convection", "Phase transition", "Post-perovskite", "Seismic anisotropy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Core-mantle boundary", "Lowermost mantle", "Mantle convection", "Post perovskite", "Seismic anisotropy", "Shear-wave anisotropy", "Temperature structure", "Texture inheritance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019878946", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56962719700": {"Name": "Walker A.", "AuthorID": "56962719700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "36608824100": {"Name": "Nowacki A.", "AuthorID": "36608824100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "8614941400": {"Name": "Wookey J.", "AuthorID": "8614941400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7006319791": {"Name": "Dobson D.", "AuthorID": "7006319791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7005495866": {"Name": "Forte A.", "AuthorID": "7005495866", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, University of Florida"}}}
