Methods: In this prospective longitudinal study, repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections and cognitive evaluations were performed in cognitively healthy elderly individuals during a 9-year period. Results: Low CSF \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2)42 levels predicted subsequent development of clinical AD 9 years later. Noteworthy, one-third of individuals with pathologically low baseline A\u03b242 levels remained cognitively intact during follow-up. No further decrease in A\u03b242 was seen in those with low levels already at baseline. Discussion: CSF A\u03b242 predicts sporadic AD at least 9 years before dementia onset and has plateaued already at this time. However, many individuals can harbor brain amyloid accumulation over a decade without signs of cognitive deterioration, which could implicate how CSF biomarkers are used to identify preclinical AD in future interventional therapeutic trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Cognitive aging", "Cohort studies", "Dementia", "Tau protein", "\u03b2-Amyloid1-42"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946087516", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"17343064300": {"Name": "Stomrud E.", "AuthorID": "17343064300", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7003614157": {"Name": "Minthon L.", "AuthorID": "7003614157", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
