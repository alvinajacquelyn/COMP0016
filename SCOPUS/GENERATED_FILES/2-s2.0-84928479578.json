Here, we examine the association between biomarkers of superficial and profound endothelial damage (syndecan-1 and soluble thrombomodulin [sTM], respectively), organ failure, and death in sepsis. The data from a clinical trial, including critically ill patients predominantly suffering sepsis (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00271752) were studied. Syndecan-1 and sTM levels at the time of study enrollment were determined. The predictive ability of biomarker levels on death and organ failures during follow-up were assessed in Cox models adjusted for potential confounders including key organ dysfunction measures assessed at enrollment. Of the 1,103 included patients, 418 died. sTM levels at the time of enrollment independently predicted risk of death in adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR] [highest quartile > 14 ng/mL vs. lowest quartile < 7 ng/mL] 2.2 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-4.0], p = 0.02, respectively). Conversely, syndecan-1 levels failed to predict death (adjusted HR [> 240 vs. < 70 ng/mL] 1.0 [95% CI: 0.6-1.5], p = 0.67). sTM but not syndecan-1 levels at enrollment predicted risk of multiple organ failure during follow-up (HR [> 14 ng/mL vs. < 7 ng/mL] 3.5 [95% CI: 1.5-8.3], p = 0.005 and 2.0 [95% CI: 0.8-5.0], p = 0.1321, respectively). Profound damage to the endothelium independently predicts risk of multiple organ failure and death in septic patients. Our findings also suggest that the detrimental effect of profound endothelial damage on risk of death operates via mechanisms other than causing organ failures per se. Therefore, damage to the endothelium appears centrally involved in the pathogenesis of death in sepsis and could be a target for intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["endothelial damage", "sepsis", "syndecan-1", "thrombomodulin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biological Markers", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Multiple Organ Failure", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Sepsis", "Syndecan-1", "Thrombomodulin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928479578", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55168171500": {"Name": "Johansen M.E.", "AuthorID": "55168171500", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free and University College Medical School London"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "14622583000": {"Name": "Jensen J.U.", "AuthorID": "14622583000", "AffiliationID": "60002327", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"}, "8683869300": {"Name": "Johansson P.I.", "AuthorID": "8683869300", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Section for Transfusion Medicine, Capital Region Blood Bank, Rigshospitalet"}, "7006413776": {"Name": "Ostrowski S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006413776", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Section for Transfusion Medicine, Capital Region Blood Bank, Rigshospitalet"}, "6602955356": {"Name": "Bestle M.H.", "AuthorID": "6602955356", "AffiliationID": "60022645", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Nordsjaellands Hospital"}, "24491751500": {"Name": "Hein L.", "AuthorID": "24491751500", "AffiliationID": "60022645", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Nordsjaellands Hospital"}, "56606661200": {"Name": "Jensen A.L.G.", "AuthorID": "56606661200", "AffiliationID": "60004829", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Glostrup"}, "6603234330": {"Name": "Soe-Jensen P.", "AuthorID": "6603234330", "AffiliationID": "60017814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Herlev"}, "22940481700": {"Name": "Andersen M.H.", "AuthorID": "22940481700", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Aarhus"}, "24492631600": {"Name": "Steensen M.", "AuthorID": "24492631600", "AffiliationID": "60002327", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Hvidovre"}, "39762368600": {"Name": "Mohr T.", "AuthorID": "39762368600", "AffiliationID": "60014959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Gentofte"}, "24492377500": {"Name": "Thormar K.", "AuthorID": "24492377500", "AffiliationID": "60025840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Bispebjerg"}, "7103191104": {"Name": "Lundgren B.", "AuthorID": "7103191104", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Diagnostic Investigations, Rigshospitalet"}}}
