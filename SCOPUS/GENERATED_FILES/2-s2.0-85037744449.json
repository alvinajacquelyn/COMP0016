So far, our understanding of CIE carrier formation has lagged behind that of clathrin-coated vesicles. Impediments have been the imprecise definition of some CIE pathways, the lack of specific cargoes being transported and of exclusive cytosolic markers and regulators. Notwithstanding these limitations, three distinct molecular mechanisms by which CIE carriers form can be defined. Cargo capture by cytosolic proteins is the main mechanism used by fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME) and interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) endocytosis. Acute signaling-induced membrane remodeling drives macropinocytosis. Finally, extracellular lipid or cargo clustering by the glycolipid-lectin (GL-Lect) hypothesis mediates the uptake of Shiga and cholera toxins and receptors by the CLIC/GEEC pathway. Here, we review these mechanisms and highlight current gaps in knowledge that will need to be addressed to complete our understanding of CIE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caveolae", "clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched endocytic compartments (CLIC/GEEC)", "clathrin-independent endocytosis", "fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME)", "glycolipid-lectin (GL-Lect) hypothesis", "glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins", "macropinocytosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Transport", "Clathrin", "Clathrin-Coated Vesicles", "Endocytosis", "Humans", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037744449", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56463384000": {"Name": "Ferreira A.", "AuthorID": "56463384000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "13612788600": {"Name": "Boucrot E.", "AuthorID": "13612788600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College"}}}
