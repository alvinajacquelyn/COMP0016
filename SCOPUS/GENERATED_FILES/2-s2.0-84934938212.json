Specifically, we use density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT to calculate the nanoparticle thermodynamic driving force for the water splitting half-reactions and identify in the process the crucial role of self-trapping of the free charge carriers responsible for proton reduction and water oxidation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Free charge carriers", "Photocatalytic water splitting", "Proton reduction", "Quantum chemistry calculations", "Thermodynamic driving forces", "Time-dependent DFT", "Water oxidation", "Water splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934938212", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55697801800": {"Name": "Berardo E.", "AuthorID": "55697801800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
