The shortage of such studies will confuse some CCHP designers when a CCHP system is designed. Therefore, in this research, theoretical discussions have been undertaken about the energy mismatch issue between CCHP systems and their users as well as the multiple effects of ESUs on CCHP systems. An improved calculational method of energy storage rate (ESR) has been adopted to evaluate the energy savings performance of CCHP systems. Two general heat-to-electricity ratios (Ruser for CCHP users and RCCHP for CCHP systems) have been used to quantify the energy mismatch between CCHP systems and their users. In the regime of 'priority of providing cooling', the ESR reaches its maximum when Ruser is equal to RCCHP. Otherwise, the ESR tends to decrease rapidly, especially when the electrical demand must be supplemented from the grid. Furthermore, when the CCHP system produces more electricity than required, the payment mode of extra electricity from the CCHP system will significantly affect the ESR. Therefore, it is imperative to reach an international consensus regarding the dispose of extra CCHP products. The theoretical analyses also corroborate the advantages of incorporating an ESU into a CCHP system. The ESU enables the CCHP system components to operate at their optimal working conditions. Meanwhile, the power generation unit and the absorption refrigerator capacities can then be reduced. Moreover, the ESU also promotes the productivity of electricity and ensures an undiminished ESR regardless of what extra electricity payment mode is adopted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP)", "Energy mismatch", "Energy saving rate", "Energy storage unit", "General heat-to-electricity ratio"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combined cooling , heating and power (CCHP)", "Energy mismatch", "Energy storage unit", "Energy-saving rates", "General heat-to-electricity ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964048420", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57188682262": {"Name": "Jiang X.Z.", "AuthorID": "57188682262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "54894671400": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "54894671400", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "57008637200": {"Name": "Zeng G.", "AuthorID": "57008637200", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7401640904": {"Name": "Shi L.", "AuthorID": "7401640904", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"}}}
