Helpdesk logs record password change events and support requests, but overlook the impact of compliance upon end-user productivity. System managers are not incentivised to investigate these impacts, so productivity costs remain with the end-user. We investigate how helpdesk log data can be analysed and augmented to expose the user\u2019s personal costs. Here we describe exploratory analysis of a university\u2019s helpdesk log data, spanning 30 months and 500,000 system events for approximately 10,000 staff and 20,000-plus students. The scale of end-user costs was identified in log data, where follow-on exploratory interviews and NASA-RTLX assessments with 20 students exposed issues which log data did not adequately represent. The majority of users reset passwords before expiration. Log analysis indicated that the online selfservice system was vastly preferred to the helpdesk, but that there was a 4:1 ratio of failed to successful attempts to recover account access. Log data did not capture the effort in managing passwords, where interviews exposed points of frustration. Participants saw the need for security but voiced a lack of understanding of the numerous restrictions on passwords. Frustrations led to adoption of diverse coping strategies, for example deliberately waiting to reset a password after reaching the post-expiry grace period. We propose ways to improve support, including real-time communication of reasons for failed password creation attempts, and measurement of timing for both successful and failed login attempts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coping strategies", "Exploratory analysis", "Password changes", "Password creation", "Password reset", "Real-time communication", "Self-service systems", "User experience"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961143991", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"19640579100": {"Name": "Parkin S.", "AuthorID": "19640579100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57184201500": {"Name": "Driss S.", "AuthorID": "57184201500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55549394300": {"Name": "Krol K.", "AuthorID": "55549394300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003530277": {"Name": "Angela Sasse M.", "AuthorID": "7003530277", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
