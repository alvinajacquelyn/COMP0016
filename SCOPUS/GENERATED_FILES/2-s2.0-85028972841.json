To this aim, named data networking (NDN) has been proposed as a future Internet architecture that enables ubiquitous in-network caching and naturally supports multipath data delivery. Particular attention has been given to using dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP to enable video streaming in NDN as in both schemes data transmission is triggered and controlled by the clients. However, state-of-the-art works do not consider the multipath capabilities of NDN and the potential improvements that multipath communication brings, such as increased throughput and reliability, which are fundamental for video streaming systems. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for dynamic adaptive streaming over network coding enabled NDN. In comparison to previous works proposing dynamic adaptive streaming over NDN, our architecture exploits network coding to efficiently use the multiple paths connecting the clients to the sources. Moreover, our architecture enables efficient multisource video streaming and improves resiliency to Data packet losses. The experimental evaluation shows that our architecture leads to reduced data traffic load on the sources, increased cache-hit rate at the in-network caches and faster adaptation of the requested video quality by the clients. The performance gains are verified through simulations in a Netflix-like scenario.", "AuthorKeywords": ["content distribution networks", "multimedia communication", "Network coding", "next generation networking", "streaming media"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive video streaming", "Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP", "Experimental evaluation", "Future internet architecture", "Multipath communications", "Named data networkings", "Quality assessment", "Streaming media"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028972841", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"53985251500": {"Name": "Saltarin J.", "AuthorID": "53985251500", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "University of Bern"}, "53983624200": {"Name": "Bourtsoulatze E.", "AuthorID": "53983624200", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "University of Bern"}, "7202108111": {"Name": "Braun T.", "AuthorID": "7202108111", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "University of Bern"}, "13309300400": {"Name": "Thomos N.", "AuthorID": "13309300400", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex"}}}
