The present study is a qualitative exploration of the views of young people, mothers, and clinicians on PROMs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of n = 10 participants (6 young people, 4 clinicians) from mental health services and n = 14 participants (4 young people, 7 mothers, 3 clinicians) from a diabetes service. For different reasons, young people, mothers, and clinicians saw feedback from PROMs as having the potential to alter the scope of clinical discussions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Mental health", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)", "Qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Attitude to Health", "Child", "Child Health Services", "Child, Preschool", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Mothers", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963731903", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families, Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families, Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "56624607400": {"Name": "Curtis-Tyler K.", "AuthorID": "56624607400", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University"}}}
