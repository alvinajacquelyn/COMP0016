We found that a lack of synaptic integration of GlyRs, together with disrupted receptor function is responsible for a lethal startle phenotype in a novel spontaneous mouse mutant shaky, caused by a missense mutation, Q177K, located in the extracellular \u03b28-\u03b29 loop of the GlyR \u03b11 subunit. Recently, structural data provided evidence that the flexibility of the \u03b28-\u03b29 loop is crucial for conformational transitions during opening and closing of the ion channel and represents a novel allosteric binding site in Cys-loop receptors. We identified the underlying neuropathological mechanisms in male and female shaky mice through a combination of protein biochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and both in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology. Increased expression of the mutant GlyR \u03b11Q177K subunit in vivo was not sufficient to compensate for a decrease in synaptic integration of \u03b11Q177K\u03b2 GlyRs. The remaining synaptic heteromeric \u03b11Q177K\u03b2 GlyRs had decreased current amplitudes with significantly faster decay times. This functional disruption reveals an important role for the GlyR \u03b11 subunit \u03b28-\u03b29 loop in initiating rearrangements within the extracellular-transmembrane GlyR interface and that this structural element is vital for inhibitory GlyR function, signaling, and synaptic clustering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fast decay", "Glycine receptor", "Hydrogen bond network", "Shaky", "Startle disease", "\u03b28-\u03b29 loop"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Extracellular Fluid", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Ion Channel Gating", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation, Missense", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Receptors, Glycine", "Severity of Illness Index", "Spinal Cord", "Stiff-Person Syndrome", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027997521", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55420655000": {"Name": "Schaefer N.", "AuthorID": "55420655000", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "57195424273": {"Name": "Littau L.", "AuthorID": "57195424273", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "7004462900": {"Name": "Jablonka S.", "AuthorID": "7004462900", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "55561798600": {"Name": "Davydova D.", "AuthorID": "55561798600", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "6603164094": {"Name": "Villmann C.", "AuthorID": "6603164094", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "7402970504": {"Name": "Berger A.", "AuthorID": "7402970504", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "7006277578": {"Name": "Paige C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006277578", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "7004292958": {"Name": "Van Brederode J.", "AuthorID": "7004292958", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "37021903300": {"Name": "Zheng F.", "AuthorID": "37021903300", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "15030878900": {"Name": "Alzheimer C.", "AuthorID": "15030878900", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "57195418484": {"Name": "Winter F.", "AuthorID": "57195418484", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "56448541900": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56448541900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}, "7403675133": {"Name": "Lynch J.W.", "AuthorID": "7403675133", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}, "55848440600": {"Name": "Leacock S.", "AuthorID": "55848440600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60032607", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Sport Sciences, University of the Sunshine Coast"}, "55413517300": {"Name": "Malhotra S.", "AuthorID": "55413517300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7006421825": {"Name": "Topf M.", "AuthorID": "7006421825", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL Birkbeck College"}}}
