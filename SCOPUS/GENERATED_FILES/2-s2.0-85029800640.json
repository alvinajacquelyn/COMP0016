Pre-training on large data sets and subsequent transfer learning to specific tasks with limited labelled training data has proved a successful strategy in other domains. Here, we implement and test this idea for detecting and classifying nuclei in histology, important tasks that enable quantifiable characterisation of prostate cancer. We pre-train a convolutional neural network for nucleus detection on a large colon histology dataset, and examine the effects of fine-tuning this network with different amounts of prostate histology data. Results show promise for clinical translation. However, we find that transfer learning is not always a viable option when training deep neural networks for nucleus classification. As such, we also demonstrate that semi-supervised ladder networks are a suitable alternative for learning a nucleus classifier with limited data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical translation", "Convolutional neural network", "Large datasets", "Prostate cancers", "Semi-supervised", "Specific tasks", "Training sample", "Transfer learning"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029800640", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56493882400": {"Name": "Jacobs J.G.", "AuthorID": "56493882400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36026988600": {"Name": "Panagiotaki E.", "AuthorID": "36026988600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "15135206900": {"Name": "Brostow G.J.", "AuthorID": "15135206900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}}}
