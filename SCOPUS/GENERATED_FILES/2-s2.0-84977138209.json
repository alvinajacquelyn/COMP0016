By combining fast volumetric image acquisition with controlled indentation of the organism using a high sensitivity force transducer, we are able to simultaneously measure activity in multiple touch receptor neurons expressing the calcium ion indicator GCaMP6s. By varying the applied mechanical stimulus we show how this method can be used to quantify touch sensitivity in C. elegans. We describe some of the challenges of performing light field calcium imaging in moving samples and demonstrate that they can be overcome by simple data processing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium imaging", "Experimental approaches", "Force transducers", "High sensitivity", "Mechanical stimulus", "Mechanosensation", "Model organisms", "Touch sensitivity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977138209", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57169472300": {"Name": "Shaw M.", "AuthorID": "57169472300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Touchlab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6506149530": {"Name": "Elmi M.", "AuthorID": "6506149530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Touchlab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "13607280000": {"Name": "Pawar V.", "AuthorID": "13607280000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Touchlab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7203044605": {"Name": "Srinivasan M.", "AuthorID": "7203044605", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "MIT Touchlab, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
