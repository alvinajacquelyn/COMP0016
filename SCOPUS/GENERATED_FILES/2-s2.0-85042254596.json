Mycobacterium tuberculosis curli pili (MTP), a virulence factor, is a potential biomarker for a reliable point of care (POC) test and was evaluated for its ability to react with Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in TB patients. An MTP synthetic peptide in a slot blot assay was used to screen serum/plasma samples (n = 65) in 3 separate cohorts, including 40 TB positive (16 HIV co-infected), 20 TB negative/HIV negative patients and 5 healthy volunteers. Forty samples were true positives (HIV positive, n = 16), 23 true negatives (HIV negative) and 2 false positives (HIV negative). The McNemar test demonstrated a 3.08% accuracy estimate (CI: \u22122.1% - 3.08%). This confirms that MTP is expressed during infection, including HIV-TB co-infection, is likely to be suitable for the design of a POC test and supports the validation of MTP for TB detection in larger patient populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Curli pili", "M. tuberculosis", "MTB", "MTP", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Bacterial", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Case-Control Studies", "Fimbriae, Bacterial", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Immunoglobulin G", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Peptide Fragments", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042254596", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57210075109": {"Name": "Naidoo N.", "AuthorID": "57210075109", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Medical Microbiology, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7007031207": {"Name": "Pillay M.", "AuthorID": "7007031207", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Medical Microbiology, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7004188159": {"Name": "Pillay B.", "AuthorID": "7004188159", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Microbiology, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "25930834900": {"Name": "Chiliza T.", "AuthorID": "25930834900", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Microbiology, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "57204998842": {"Name": "Bubb M.", "AuthorID": "57204998842", "AffiliationID": "60009169", "AffiliationName": "National Bioproducts Institute"}, "57200265521": {"Name": "Pym A.", "AuthorID": "57200265521", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "15055863700": {"Name": "Kasprowicz V.O.", "AuthorID": "15055863700", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "35325100900": {"Name": "Naidoo K.", "AuthorID": "35325100900", "AffiliationID": "60094841, 60010499, 60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council HIV-TB Pathogenesis and Treatment Research Unit, Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
