Methods: PEGylated liposomes composed of several synthetic lipids were tested for their ability to preserve Wnt3A activity in reporter and differentiation assays. Single-molecule microspectroscopy was used to test for direct association of protein with liposomes. Results: Labeled Wnt3A protein directly associated with all tested liposome preparations. However, Wnt3A activity was preserved or enhanced in PEGylated 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) liposomes but not in PEGylated 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes. PEGylated Wnt3A liposomes associated with skeletal stem cell populations in human bone marrow and promoted osteogenesis. Conclusion: Active Wnt protein-containing PEGylated liposomes may have utility for systemic administration for bone repair.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fracture repair", "liposomes", "marrow stromal cells", "mesenchymal stem cells", "osteoprogenitors", "PEGylated liposomes", "regenerative medicine", "skeletal stem cells", "Wnt"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Differentiation", "Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine", "Humans", "Liposomes", "Osteogenesis", "Phosphatidylcholines", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Stem Cells", "Wnt3A Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017341307", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"36113590200": {"Name": "Janeczek A.", "AuthorID": "36113590200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Human Development and Health Academic Unit, Centre for Human Development, University of Southampton"}, "57190968757": {"Name": "Scarpa E.", "AuthorID": "57190968757", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Human Development and Health Academic Unit, Centre for Human Development, University of Southampton"}, "6602961278": {"Name": "Tare R.", "AuthorID": "6602961278", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Human Development and Health Academic Unit, Centre for Human Development, University of Southampton"}, "7004135804": {"Name": "Oreffo R.", "AuthorID": "7004135804", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Human Development and Health Academic Unit, Centre for Human Development, University of Southampton"}, "57214563117": {"Name": "Evans N.", "AuthorID": "57214563117", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Human Development and Health Academic Unit, Centre for Human Development, University of Southampton"}, "7103016685": {"Name": "Newman T.", "AuthorID": "7103016685", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "36793842600": {"Name": "Rowland C.", "AuthorID": "36793842600", "AffiliationID": "60022652", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Group, Chemical, Biological and Radiological Division"}, "7003351179": {"Name": "Jenner D.", "AuthorID": "7003351179", "AffiliationID": "60022652", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Group, Chemical, Biological and Radiological Division"}, "54882520800": {"Name": "Horrocks M.", "AuthorID": "54882520800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56965835700": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "56965835700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
