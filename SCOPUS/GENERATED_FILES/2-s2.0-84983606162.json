Adoption of the S-ICD requires implanters to learn a new implantation technique. The aim of this study was to assess the learning curve for S-ICD implanters with respect to implant-related complications, procedure time, and inappropriate shocks (IASs). Methods and results: In a pooled cohort from two clinical S-ICD databases, the IDE Trial and the EFFORTLESS Registry, complications, IASs at 180 days follow-up and implant procedure duration were assessed. Patients were grouped in quartiles based on experience of the implanter and Kaplan-Meier estimates of complication and IAS rates were calculated. A total of 882 patients implanted in 61 centres by 107 implanters with a median of 4 implants (IQR 1,8) were analysed. There were a total of 59 patients with complications and 48 patients with IAS. The complication rate decreased significantly from 9.8% in Quartile 1 (least experience) to 5.4% in Quartile 4 (most experience) (P = 0.02) and non-significantly for IAS from 7.9 to 4.8% (P = 0.10). Multivariable analysis demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.78 (P = 0.045) for complications and 1.01 (P = 0.958) for IAS. Dual-zone programming increased with experience of the individual implanter (P < 0.001), which reduced IAS significantly in the multivariable model (HR 0.44, P = 0.01). Procedure time decreased from 75 to 65 min (P < 0.001). The complication rate and procedure time stabilized after Quartile 2 (>13 implants). Conclusion: There is a short and significant learning curve associated with physicians adopting the S-ICD. Performance stabilizes after 13 implants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complications", "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator", "Inappropriate shock", "Learning curve", "S-ICD", "Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Databases, Factual", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electric Countershock", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Learning Curve", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prosthesis Implantation", "Registries", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983606162", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"36473286400": {"Name": "Knops R.E.", "AuthorID": "36473286400", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}, "56730642700": {"Name": "Brouwer T.F.", "AuthorID": "56730642700", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center"}, "26421288800": {"Name": "Olde Nordkamp L.R.A.", "AuthorID": "26421288800", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}, "7101663676": {"Name": "Barr C.S.", "AuthorID": "7101663676", "AffiliationID": "60026570", "AffiliationName": "Russells Hall Hospital"}, "6603638449": {"Name": "Theuns D.A.", "AuthorID": "6603638449", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus Medical Center"}, "7004921270": {"Name": "Boersma L.", "AuthorID": "7004921270", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "St. Antonius Ziekenhuis"}, "7404027538": {"Name": "Weiss R.", "AuthorID": "7404027538", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Ohio State University"}, "7004119966": {"Name": "Neuzil P.", "AuthorID": "7004119966", "AffiliationID": "60010760", "AffiliationName": "Na Homolce Hospital"}, "7006805807": {"Name": "Scholten M.", "AuthorID": "7006805807", "AffiliationID": "60005675", "AffiliationName": "Medisch Spectrum Twente"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "26642924200": {"Name": "Leon A.R.", "AuthorID": "26642924200", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Emory University"}, "7006920090": {"Name": "Hood M.", "AuthorID": "7006920090", "AffiliationID": "60011750", "AffiliationName": "Auckland City Hospital"}, "57193501125": {"Name": "Jones P.W.", "AuthorID": "57193501125", "AffiliationID": "101895676", "AffiliationName": "Boston Scientific"}, "23976930200": {"Name": "Wold N.", "AuthorID": "23976930200", "AffiliationID": "101895676", "AffiliationName": "Boston Scientific"}, "7102284681": {"Name": "Grace A.A.", "AuthorID": "7102284681", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402868775": {"Name": "Burke M.C.", "AuthorID": "7402868775", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "University of Chicago"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
