The aim of this study was to identify systemic alterations in lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a, heatshock cognate-70, and glucocerebrosidase levels/activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients. Methods: Protein/mRNA levels were assessed in PD patients from genetically undetermined background, alpha-synuclein (G209A/A53T), or glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers and age-/sex-matched controls. Results: Heatshock cognate 70 protein levels were reduced in all PD groups, whereas its mRNA levels were decreased only in the genetically undetermined group. Glucocerebrosidase protein levels were decreased only in the genetic PD groups, whereas increased mRNA levels and decreased activity were detected only in the glucocerebrosidase mutation group. Conclusions: Reduced heatshock cognate-70 levels are suggestive of an apparent systemic chaperone-mediated autophagy dysfunction irrespective of genetic background. Glucocerebrosidase activity may serve as a screening tool to identify glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers with PD. \u00a9 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alpha-synuclein", "chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)", "glucocerebrosidase (GCase)", "Hsc70", "lysosome", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978500934", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School"}, "12781377100": {"Name": "Xilouri M.", "AuthorID": "12781377100", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "12790281200": {"Name": "Maniati M.", "AuthorID": "12790281200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School"}, "42261006800": {"Name": "Antonelou R.", "AuthorID": "42261006800", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School"}, "56430631100": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "56430631100", "AffiliationID": "100405850", "AffiliationName": "Dynan Hospital"}, "6603497576": {"Name": "Moraitou M.", "AuthorID": "6603497576", "AffiliationID": "108218279", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}, "7003963499": {"Name": "Michelakakis H.", "AuthorID": "7003963499", "AffiliationID": "108218279", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}}}
