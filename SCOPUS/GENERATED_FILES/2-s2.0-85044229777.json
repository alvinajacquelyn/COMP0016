Methods: A prospective trial investigated the feasibility of adaptive intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)\u202f\u00b1 concomitant cetuximab in 10 patients. The primary endpoint was achieving a 2-year survival free of grade >3 toxicity in \u226530% of patients. Three treatment plans based on 3 PET/CT scans were consecutively delivered in 6 weeks. The range of dose painting was 66.0\u201385.0\u202fGy in the dose-painted tumoral volumes in 30 fractions. Results: Two-year locoregional and distant control rates were 38 and 76%, respectively. Overall and disease-free survival at 2 years was 20%. No grade 4 or 5 acute toxicity was observed in any of the patients, except for arterial mucosal hemorrhage in 1 patient. Three months after radiotherapy, grade 4 dysphagia and mucosal wound healing problems were observed in 1/7 and 1/6 of patients, respectively. Grade 5 toxicity (fatal bleeding) was seen in 2 patients, at 3.8 and 4.1 months of follow-up. Data on 2\u2011year toxicity could only be assessed in 1 of the 2 surviving patients, in whom grade 4 mucosal wound healing problems were observed; no other grade >3 toxicity was observed. In this respect, a 30% 2\u2011year survival free of grade >3 toxicity will not be achieved. Conclusions: Adaptive PET-guided reirradiation is feasible. However, due to slow accrual and treatment results that seemed inconsistent with achieving the primary endpoint, the trial was stopped early.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-FDG-PET", "Adaptive radiotherapy", "Dose painting", "Head and neck tumors", "Reirradiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cetuximab", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced", "Neoplasms, Second Primary", "Otorhinolaryngologic Neoplasms", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prospective Studies", "Radiation Injuries", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Radiotherapy, Image-Guided", "Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044229777", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56801883200": {"Name": "Schatteman J.", "AuthorID": "56801883200", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ghent University Hospital"}, "51763197900": {"Name": "Berwouts D.", "AuthorID": "51763197900", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7003403866": {"Name": "Goethals I.", "AuthorID": "7003403866", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ghent University Hospital"}, "22942607400": {"Name": "Van Gestel D.", "AuthorID": "22942607400", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "55776237500": {"Name": "De Kerf G.", "AuthorID": "55776237500", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "7801344174": {"Name": "De Ost B.", "AuthorID": "7801344174", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "6603613896": {"Name": "De Gersem W.", "AuthorID": "6603613896", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7005851613": {"Name": "De Neve W.", "AuthorID": "7005851613", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "21234238200": {"Name": "Olteanu A.", "AuthorID": "21234238200", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "55801285800": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "55801285800", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "24832579700": {"Name": "Duprez F.", "AuthorID": "24832579700", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "19837586200": {"Name": "Rottey S.", "AuthorID": "19837586200", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}}}
