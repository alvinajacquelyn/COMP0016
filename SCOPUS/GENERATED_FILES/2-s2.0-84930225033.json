In particular, partition coefficients of the substrate and product, mass-transfer coefficients of the substrate, product and oxygen, as well as the deactivation parameters related to the loss of cell viability, owing to the presence of the IL, were determined. To the best of our knowledge, cell viability was described, for the first time, using a power law equation model. The operation of the biphasic system without inhibitory conditions led to a substrate conversion of 100%, whereas the conversion was approximately 25% under inhibitory conditions. Besides, when the IL was used as the dispersed phase in the TPPB, the substrate conversion under inhibitory conditions was between 20% and 85%. All evaluated ILs were thermodynamically suitable for use as the dispersed phase; however, all of them provoked a loss in cell viability. When trioctylmethylammonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [OMA][BTA] was used in the three-phase system, the highest substrate conversion (ca. 85%) and the lowest loss of cell viability (ca. 55%) were observed, even though this IL presented lower partition coefficients for the substrate and product as well as the lowest oxygen, substrate and product mass-transfer coefficients compared to the other ILs under the studied operating conditions. These results indicate that the effect of the IL on the cell viability is an essential parameter that must be considered before the application of an IL in TPPB technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ionic liquids", "Loss of cell viability", "Partitioning bioreactor", "Power law equation model", "Production of lactones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell viability", "Ionic liquid (ils)", "Operating condition", "Partition coefficient", "Partitioning bioreactors", "Power law equation", "Substrate conversion", "Three-phase partitioning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930225033", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"26538839100": {"Name": "Melgarejo-Torres R.", "AuthorID": "26538839100", "AffiliationID": "60028381", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"}, "55964965200": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Ordaz P.", "AuthorID": "55964965200", "AffiliationID": "60028381", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"}, "12144465900": {"Name": "Huerta-Ochoa S.", "AuthorID": "12144465900", "AffiliationID": "60028381", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"}, "23007559200": {"Name": "Castillo-Araiza C.O.", "AuthorID": "23007559200", "AffiliationID": "60028381", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de Procesos de Transporte y Reacci\u00f3n en Sistemas Multif\u00e1sicos, Departamento de IPH, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"}, "56663280600": {"Name": "Calleja-Casta\u00f1eda N.V.", "AuthorID": "56663280600", "AffiliationID": "60002604", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica, Universidad del Valle de M\u00e9xico-Coyoacan"}, "55619907500": {"Name": "Cano-Velasco J.L.", "AuthorID": "55619907500", "AffiliationID": "60002604", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica, Universidad del Valle de M\u00e9xico-Coyoacan"}, "7005843750": {"Name": "Camacho-Ru\u00edz R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005843750", "AffiliationID": "60069653", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Asistencia en Tecnolog\u00eda y Diseno del Estado de Jalisco"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
