Method: In a cross-sectional study among patients with somatoform disorder, self-report data were obtained using measures for alexithymia (Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire), attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire), personality pathology (Inventory of Personality Organization), and negative affectivity (Dutch Short Form of the MMPI). We used hierarchical regression analyses to test main effects of attachment deactivation and hyperactivation strategies in the prediction of both cognitive and affective alexithymia, while controlling for the levels of negative affectivity and personality pathology. Results: Only cognitive alexithymia, i.e., the inability to analyze, identify, and verbalize emotions, was associated with personality dysfunction, in particular insecure attachment strategies. Affective alexithymia, i.e., the inability to fantasize and to experience emotions, was associated (negatively) with negative affectivity but not with the personality variables. Conclusions: This study, therefore, indicates that both types of alexithymia are relevant for the assessment and treatment of severe somatoform disorder, yet each type may tap into different features of somatoform disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective alexithymia", "Attachment strategies", "Cognitive alexithymia", "Insecure attachment", "Negative affectivity", "Personality pathology", "Somatoform disorders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affective Symptoms", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Object Attachment", "Personality Disorders", "Severity of Illness Index", "Somatoform Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940998688", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"23975852300": {"Name": "Koelen J.", "AuthorID": "23975852300", "AffiliationID": "116578366", "AffiliationName": "Altrecht Psychosomatic Medicine"}, "6602194681": {"Name": "Eurelings-Bontekoe E.", "AuthorID": "6602194681", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, Leiden University"}, "56823641700": {"Name": "Stuke F.", "AuthorID": "56823641700", "AffiliationID": "109682107", "AffiliationName": "Psychologische Hochschule Berlin"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
