All rights reserved.We would like to report the first case in English literature, to the best of our knowledge, of a synchronous hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as to address the current trends and challenges in the management of HEHE. An otherwise well 58-year-old man was referred to his local hepatology service with elevated serum \u03b3-GT levels. Imaging revealed bilobar liver lesions consistent with HEHE, a discrete left lobe lesion suspected as HCC, and multiple pulmonary nodules. Biopsies confirmed HEHE with pulmonary metastases. After multidisciplinary team discussions, the patient was admitted under our team and underwent an uneventful laparoscopic left lateral hepatectomy for suspected HCC, which was confirmed histologically. As part of a watch-and-wait approach to metastatic HEHE, in the first follow-up (3 months postoperatively) the patient was clinically fine and the surveillance CT scan did not show recurrent disease. By presenting this case, we aim to raise awareness that this rare entity can coexist with others, potentially complicating their management.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid", "Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Liver Function Tests", "Liver Neoplasms", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Pulmonary Nodules", "Treatment Outcome", "Watchful Waiting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944895464", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"29067568400": {"Name": "Athanasopoulos P.G.", "AuthorID": "29067568400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Transplantation and Immunology, Royal Free London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "55209956700": {"Name": "Hadjittofi C.", "AuthorID": "55209956700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Transplantation and Immunology, Royal Free London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "54916621100": {"Name": "Luong T.V.", "AuthorID": "54916621100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6701855309": {"Name": "O'Beirne J.", "AuthorID": "6701855309", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Transplant, Hepatology, Gastroenterology and HPB Surgery, Division of Transplantation and Immunology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57189238897": {"Name": "Sharma D.", "AuthorID": "57189238897", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Transplant, Hepatology, Gastroenterology and HPB Surgery, Division of Transplantation and Immunology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
