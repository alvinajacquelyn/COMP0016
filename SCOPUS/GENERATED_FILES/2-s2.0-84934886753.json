However, evidence from randomized placebo-controlled trials is inconclusive. Aims: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on cognition in healthy populations and those with ADHD and related disorders (RDs). Methods: Databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and school-aged children (who were healthy and typically developing (TD) or had ADHD or a related-neurodevelopmental disorder (ADHD+RD) which assessed the effects of n-3 PUFA on cognition. Results: In the 24 included studies n-3 PUFA supplementation, in the whole sample and the TD and ADHD+RD subgroup, did not show improvements in any of the cognitive performance measures. In those with low n-3 PUFA status, supplementation improved short-term memory. Conclusions: There is marginal evidence that n-3 PUFA supplementation effects cognition in those who are n-3 PUFA deficient. However, there is no evidence of an effect in the general population or those with neurodevelopmental disorders. This has important implications given the widespread advertisement and consumption of n-3 PUFA; claims of cognitive benefit should be narrowed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "cognition", "meta-analysis", "omega-3", "randomised controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Cognition", "Dietary Supplements", "Fatty Acids, Omega-3", "Humans", "Memory, Short-Term", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934886753", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56054697200": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "56054697200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "40561848200": {"Name": "Tye C.", "AuthorID": "40561848200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "6603162889": {"Name": "Kuntsi J.", "AuthorID": "6603162889", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "55961024500": {"Name": "Vassos E.", "AuthorID": "55961024500", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "35402700900": {"Name": "Asherson P.", "AuthorID": "35402700900", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}}}
