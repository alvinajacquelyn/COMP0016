Weshow here that the absence of neuropathic pain response in infant male rats and mice following nerve injury is due to an active, constitutive immune suppression of dorsal horn pain activity. In contrast to adult nerve injury, which triggers a proin flammatoryimmune response in the spinal dorsal horn, infant nerve injury triggers an anti-inflammatory immune response, characterized by significant increases in IL-4 and IL-10. This immediate anti-inflammatory response can also be evoked by direct C-fiber nerve stimulation in infant, but not adult, mice. Blockade of the anti-inflammatory activity with intrathecal anti-IL10 unmasks neuropathic pain behavior in infant nerve injured mice, showing that pain hypersensitivity in young mice is actively suppressed by a dominant anti-inflammatory neuroimmune response. As infant nerve injured mice reach adolescence (postnatal day 25\u201330), the dorsal horn immune profile switches from an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory response characterized by significant increases in TNF and BDNF, and this is accompanied by a late onset neuropathic pain behavior and increased dorsal horn cell sensitivity to cutaneous mechanical and cold stimuli. These findings show that neuropathic pain following early life nerve injury is not absent but suppressed by neuroimmune activity and that \u201clatent\u201d pain can still emerge at adolescence, when the neuroimmune profile changes. The data may explain why neuropathic pain is rare in young children and also why it can emerge, for no observable reason, in adolescent patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-inflammatory", "Development", "Dorsal horn", "Infant", "Neuropathic", "Pain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Hyperalgesia", "Interleukin-10", "Interleukin-4", "Male", "Mice", "Neuralgia", "Neuroimmunomodulation", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920997919", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55611879900": {"Name": "McKelvey R.", "AuthorID": "55611879900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7402773525": {"Name": "Fitzgerald M.", "AuthorID": "7402773525", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "9433011700": {"Name": "Berta T.", "AuthorID": "9433011700", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Anesthesiology and Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center"}, "34975075500": {"Name": "Ji R.", "AuthorID": "34975075500", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Anesthesiology and Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center"}, "53980267700": {"Name": "Old E.", "AuthorID": "53980267700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age Related Diseases, King\u2019s College London"}}}
