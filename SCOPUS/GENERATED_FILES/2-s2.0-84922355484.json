More recently, there has been considerable interest in compounds, such as positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs), that are able to modulate nAChR function by binding to distinct allosteric sites. Here we examined a series of compounds differing only in methyl substitution of a single aromatic ring. This series of compounds includes a previously described \u03b17-selective allosteric agonist, cis-cis-4-p-tolyl-3a, 4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide (4MP-TQS), together with all other possible combinations of methyl substitution at a phenyl ring (18 additional compounds). Studies conducted with this series of compounds have revealed five distinct pharmacological effects on \u03b17 nAChRs. These five effects can be summarized as: 1) nondesensitizing activation (allosteric agonists), 2) potentiation associated with minimal effects on receptor desensitization (type I PAMs), 3) potentiation associated with reduced desensitization (type II PAMs), 4) noncompetitive antagonism (NAMs), and 5) compounds that have no effect on orthosteric agonist responses but block allosteric modulation (silent allosteric modulators (SAMs)). Several lines of experimental evidence are consistent with all of these compounds acting at a common, transmembrane allosteric site. Notably, all of these chemically similar compounds that have been classified as nondesensitizing allosteric agonists or as nondesensitizing (type II) PAMs are cis-cis-diastereoisomers, whereas all of the NAMs, SAMs, and type I PAMs are cis-trans-diastereoisomers. Our data illustrate the remarkable pharmacological diversity of allosteric modulators acting on nAChRs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Allosteric modulation", "Allosteric modulators", "Diastereoisomers", "Experimental evidence", "Minimal effects", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)", "Pharmacological effects", "Allosteric Site", "alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor", "Animals", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Nicotinic Agonists", "Nicotinic Antagonists", "Quinolines", "Sulfonamides", "Xenopus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922355484", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56507333000": {"Name": "Gill-Thind J.", "AuthorID": "56507333000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006347978": {"Name": "Millar N.", "AuthorID": "7006347978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55193569000": {"Name": "Dhankher P.", "AuthorID": "55193569000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35299034100": {"Name": "D'Oyley J.", "AuthorID": "35299034100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
