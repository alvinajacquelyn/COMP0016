The Doehlert matrix (DM) statistical model was utilized to probe the synthetic parameters of mesoporous titanosilicate microspheres (MTSM), in order to increase their catalytic activity with a minimal number of experiments. Synthesis optimization was carried out by varying two parameters simultaneously: homogenizing temperature and surfactant weight. Thirteen different MTSM samples were synthesized in two sequential \u2018matrices\u2019 according to Doehlert conditions and were used to catalyse the epoxidation of cyclohexene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The samples (and the corresponding synthesis conditions) with superior catalytic activity in terms of product yield and selectivity were identified. In addition, this approach revealed the limiting values of each synthesis parameter, beyond which the material becomes catalytically ineffective. This study demonstrates that the DM approach can be broadly used as a powerful and time-efficient tool for investigating the optimal synthesis conditions of heterogeneous catalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cyclohexene epoxidation", "Heterogeneous catalyst", "Mesoporous titanosilicates", "Synthesis conditions", "Synthesis optimization", "Synthesis parameters", "Synthetic parameters", "Tert-butylhydroperoxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041109771", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55551220900": {"Name": "Perera A.", "AuthorID": "55551220900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "22954519900": {"Name": "Trogadas P.", "AuthorID": "22954519900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54790515100": {"Name": "Coppens M.", "AuthorID": "54790515100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "12803447700": {"Name": "Nigra M.", "AuthorID": "12803447700", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Utah"}, "57207247553": {"Name": "Yu H.", "AuthorID": "57207247553", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
