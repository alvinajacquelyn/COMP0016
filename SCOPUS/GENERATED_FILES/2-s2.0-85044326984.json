Here, we use two-color confocal microscopy to investigate the dynamics of charge in type 1b diamond hosting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers. By examining the nonlocal fluorescence patterns emerging from local laser excitation, we show that, in the simultaneous presence of photogenerated electrons and holes, SiV (NV) centers selectively transform into the negative (neutral) charge state. Unlike NVs, 532 nm illumination ionizes SiV- via a single-photon process, thus hinting at a comparatively shallower ground state. In particular, slower ionization rates at longer wavelengths suggest the latter lies approximately \u223c1.9 eV below the conduction band minimum. Building on the above observations, we demonstrate on-demand SiV and NV charge initialization over large areas via green laser illumination of variable intensity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conduction-band minimum", "Fluorescence patterns", "Negatively charged", "Nitrogen vacancies", "Photogenerated electrons", "Photoionization dynamics", "Quantum information science", "Single photon process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044326984", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55240156600": {"Name": "Dhomkar S.", "AuthorID": "55240156600", "AffiliationID": "60028458, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, CUNY-City College of New York"}, "52365448600": {"Name": "Zangara P.R.", "AuthorID": "52365448600", "AffiliationID": "60028458, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, CUNY-City College of New York"}, "56450464100": {"Name": "Henshaw J.", "AuthorID": "56450464100", "AffiliationID": "60032373, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "CUNY-Graduate Center"}, "57219105881": {"Name": "Meriles C.A.", "AuthorID": "57219105881", "AffiliationID": "60032373, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "CUNY-Graduate Center"}}}
