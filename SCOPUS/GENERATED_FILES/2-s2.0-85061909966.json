Methods: A total of 152 IPF patients had vessel volume, density, tortuosity and heterogeneity quantified from computed tomography (CT) images by a fully automated algorithm. Separate quantitation of vessel metrics in pulmonary arteries and veins was performed in 106 patients. Results were evaluated against readouts from lung function tests. Results: Normalized vessel volume expressed as a percentage of total lung volume was moderately correlated with functional indices on univariable linear regression analysis: forced vital capacity (R 2 = 0.27, P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DL CO ; R 2 = 0.12, P = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), total lung capacity (TLC; R 2 = 0.45, P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) and composite physiologic index (CPI; R 2 = 0.28, P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). Normalized vessel volume was correlated with vessel density but not with vessel heterogeneity. Quantitatively derived vessel metrics (and artery and vein subdivision scores) were not significantly linked with the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (K CO ), and only weakly with DL CO . On multivariable linear regression analysis, normalized vessel volume and vessel heterogeneity were independently linked with DL CO , TLC and CPI indicating that they capture different aspects of lung damage. Artery\u2013vein separation provided no additional information beyond that captured in the whole vasculature. Conclusion: Our study confirms previous observations of links between vessel volume and functional measures of disease severity in IPF using a new vessel quantitation tool. Additionally, the new tool shows independent linkages of normalized vessel volume and vessel heterogeneity with functional indices. Quantitative vessel metrics do not appear to reflect vasculopathic damage in IPF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["interstitial lung disease", "lung fibrosis", "radiology and other imaging", "respiratory structure and function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Algorithms", "Carbon Monoxide", "Female", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Artery", "Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity", "Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tidal Volume", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061909966", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57202517377": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57202517377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55826324100": {"Name": "Pienn M.", "AuthorID": "55826324100", "AffiliationID": "60005035", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research"}, "55256835200": {"Name": "Olschewski H.", "AuthorID": "55256835200", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz"}, "57015281500": {"Name": "Payer C.", "AuthorID": "57015281500", "AffiliationID": "60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz University of Technology"}, "8554711200": {"Name": "Urschler M.", "AuthorID": "8554711200", "AffiliationID": "60005035", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Clinical-Forensic Imaging"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "22955579800": {"Name": "Devaraj A.", "AuthorID": "22955579800", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}}}
