The methodology, involving the adaptive partition of the domain into uniformly discretised regions, is extended to systems of equations without increase in algorithmic complexity. By application first to the simpler case of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, the technique is shown to handle shocks without loss of accuracy and to result in significant CPU runtime reductions of over 90%. Application to more complex two-phase flow problems, including the flashing flow during the decompression of a pipeline, also show dramatic increase in computational performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive Mesh Refinement", "Carbon Capture and Storage", "Multi-phase flow", "Pipeline decompression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive mesh refinement", "Adaptive partitions", "Algorithmic complexity", "Carbon capture and storage", "Computational performance", "Equations of gas dynamics", "Loss of accuracy", "Systems of equations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933530995", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57214631878": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "57214631878", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.S.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003505415": {"Name": "Mahgerefteh H.", "AuthorID": "7003505415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "26531554000": {"Name": "Martynov S.", "AuthorID": "26531554000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
