We use the Vote-with-the-Wallet Game, (VWG), a version of a repeated multiplayer prisoner\u2019s dilemma that mimics the characteristics of the choice between a conventional and a socially responsible product. More precisely we test the effect of three factors: two different frames and an ex-post redistribution mechanism that transfers resources from purely self-interested consumers to responsible ones. We find that women remain significantly more cooperative (choosing more often the responsible good) when the redistribution mechanism is interrupted and are significantly less satisfied about the behaviour of the other players in that treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gender differences", "lab experiment", "Responsible consumption", "social preferences"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041550924", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7004109622": {"Name": "Becchetti L.", "AuthorID": "7004109622", "AffiliationID": "60103891", "AffiliationName": "Professorial Research Associate at SOAS, University of London, School of Finance and Management"}, "57191057859": {"Name": "Salustri F.", "AuthorID": "57191057859", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Finance, University of Rome"}, "24081211700": {"Name": "Pelligra V.", "AuthorID": "24081211700", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Business, University of Cagliari"}, "57200526077": {"Name": "V\u00e1squez A.", "AuthorID": "57200526077", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Business, University of Cagliari"}}}
