A systematic method was developed for definition of a boost target volume prior to a formal phase-I study. Material and methods Reference structures were defined by two oncologists and one radiologist, target structures were submitted by eight oncologist investigators and compared using conformity indices. Resultant risk of duodenal bleed (NTCP) was modelled. Results For GTV, reference volume was 2.1 cm3 and investigator mean was 6.03 cm3 (95% CI 3.92\u20138.13 cm3), for boost volume 1.1 cm3 and 1.25 cm3 (1.02\u20131.48 cm3). Mean Dice conformity coefficient for GTV was 0.47 (0.38\u20130.56), and for boost volume was significantly higher at 0.61 (0.52\u20130.70, p = 0.01). Discordance index (DI) for GTV was 0.65 (0.56\u20130.75) and for boost volume was significantly lower at 0.39 (0.28\u20130.49, p = 0.001). NTCP using reference contours was 2.95%, with mean for investigator contour plans 3.93% (3.63\u20134.22%). Correlations were seen between NTCP and GTV volume (p = 0.02) and NTCP and DI (correlation coefficient 0.83 (0.29\u20130.97), p = 0.01). Conclusions Better conformity with reference was shown for boost volume compared with GTV. Investigator GTV volumes were larger than reference, had higher DI scores and modelled toxicity risk. A consistent method of target structure definition for margin-directed pancreatic radiotherapy is demonstrated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borderline-resectable", "Pancreatic cancer", "Radiation therapy quality assurance", "SBRT", "Target volume definition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiosurgery", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992623487", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57191157403": {"Name": "Holyoake D.L.P.", "AuthorID": "57191157403", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "The Churchill Hospital"}, "57203905198": {"Name": "Robinson M.", "AuthorID": "57203905198", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "The Churchill Hospital"}, "57206379006": {"Name": "Partridge M.", "AuthorID": "57206379006", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "12902771600": {"Name": "Mukherjee S.", "AuthorID": "12902771600", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "The Churchill Hospital"}, "9275515900": {"Name": "Hawkins M.A.", "AuthorID": "9275515900", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "The Churchill Hospital"}, "26030375800": {"Name": "Grose D.", "AuthorID": "26030375800", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "56679362400": {"Name": "McIntosh D.", "AuthorID": "56679362400", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "6701695217": {"Name": "Sebag-Montefiore D.", "AuthorID": "6701695217", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Cancer Centre, St James's University Hospital"}, "25630849800": {"Name": "Radhakrishna G.", "AuthorID": "25630849800", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Cancer Centre, St James's University Hospital"}, "35217989500": {"Name": "Patel N.", "AuthorID": "35217989500", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "The Churchill Hospital"}}}
