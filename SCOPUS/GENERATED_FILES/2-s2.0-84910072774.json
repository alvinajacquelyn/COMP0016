In recent years, a variety of biophysical models have been proposed to associate particular patterns observed in the measured signal with specific microstructural properties of the neuronal tissue, such as axon diameter and fiber density. Despite very appealing results showing that the estimated microstructure indices agree very well with histological examinations, existing techniques require computationally very expensive non-linear procedures to fit the models to the data which, in practice, demand the use of powerful computer clusters for large-scale applications. In this work, we present a general framework for Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization (AMICO) and show how to re-formulate this class of techniques as convenient linear systems which, then, can be efficiently solved using very fast algorithms. We demonstrate this linearization of the fitting problem for two specific models, i.e. ActiveAx and NODDI, providing a very attractive alternative for parameter estimation in those techniques; however, the AMICO framework is general and flexible enough to work also for the wider space of microstructure imaging methods. Results demonstrate that AMICO represents an effective means to accelerate the fit of existing techniques drastically (up to four orders of magnitude faster) while preserving accuracy and precision in the estimated model parameters (correlation above 0.9). We believe that the availability of such ultrafast algorithms will help to accelerate the spread of microstructure imaging to larger cohorts of patients and to study a wider spectrum of neurological disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convex optimization", "Diffusion MRI", "Microstructure imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Brain", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84910072774", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"26430368900": {"Name": "Daducci A.", "AuthorID": "26430368900", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Center (CHUV), University of Lausanne (UNIL)"}, "35554798200": {"Name": "Thiran J.P.", "AuthorID": "35554798200", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Center (CHUV), University of Lausanne (UNIL)"}, "16506160800": {"Name": "Canales-Rodr\u00edguez E.J.", "AuthorID": "16506160800", "AffiliationID": "60104561", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Salud Mental"}, "16315884700": {"Name": "Dyrby T.B.", "AuthorID": "16315884700", "AffiliationID": "60002327", "AffiliationName": "Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance, Centre for Functional and Diagnostic Imaging and Research, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
