It draws on an ESRC-funded study of \u2018policy enactments in secondary schools\u2019, which was based on case-study work in four \u2018ordinary\u2019 schools. Here the data set is re-examined to understand the extent to which Ofsted had an ongoing influence on the work of the leadership, management and teachers in these schools. We undertook a process of secondary analysis of the data from the project and found that the influence of the inspection agenda was strong in the schools, policy decisions were often being made to conform to Ofsted\u2019s expectations and the influence on leadership and management was clearly apparent. In resisting this agenda we also found that schools to some extent performed \u2018the good school\u2019 for inspections. Finally, we relate this empirical evidence to conceptions of governmentality and post-panopticism to shed new light on their theoretical relevance to contemporary inspection regimes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Foucault", "inspection", "policy", "schools"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029504753", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"12141148500": {"Name": "Perryman J.", "AuthorID": "12141148500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "23134795600": {"Name": "Braun A.", "AuthorID": "23134795600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7202536805": {"Name": "Ball S.", "AuthorID": "7202536805", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7201807975": {"Name": "Maguire M.", "AuthorID": "7201807975", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College"}}}
