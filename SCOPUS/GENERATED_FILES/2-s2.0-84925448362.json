The emerging consensus is one which points to this group of young people experiencing greater difficulties and poorer outcomes compared to the general population. How these investigations have been conducted, including the research designs adopted, has received less attention. This is important as research designs influence what is known and understood. The aim of the present study was to review how empirical studies published in Europe over a 10-year period have conceptualised and researched transition for young adults with LDs. The findings show that the post-16 transition for this group of young adults remains under researched and that a variety of research approaches and data collection methods are used. Despite some overlap in how transition has been conceptualised, diversity exists with respect to the elements of transition examined. This article concludes with recommendations for how future studies might build on the strengths of current research approaches in order to provide a more holistic and nuanced account of the lives of this group of young adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disability", "learning difficulties", "review", "special educational needs", "transition", "young adulthood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925448362", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"36106634700": {"Name": "Carroll C.", "AuthorID": "36106634700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "SENJIT, Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
