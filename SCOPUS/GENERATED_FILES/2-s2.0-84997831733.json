These polymers exhibit extremely small band gaps of \u223c1.2 eV, impressive crystallinity, and extremely high n-type mobility exceeding 3 cm2 V s-1. The n-type charge carrier mobility can be correlated with the remarkably high crystallinity along the polymer backbone having a correlation length in excess of 20 nm. Theoretical analysis reveals that the novel polymers have highly rigid nonplanar geometries demonstrating that backbone planarity is not a prerequisite for either narrow band gap materials or ultrahigh mobilities. Furthermore, the variation in backbone crystallinity is dependent on the choice of comonomer. OPV device efficiencies up to 4.1% and charge photogeneration up to 1000 nm are demonstrated, highlighting the potential of this novel chromophore class in high-performance organic electronics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge photogeneration", "Correlation lengths", "Device efficiency", "High crystallinity", "Nonplanar geometry", "Organic electronics", "Polymer electronics", "Synthesis and characterizations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997831733", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56779792400": {"Name": "Fallon K.J.", "AuthorID": "56779792400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "57198058937": {"Name": "Freeman D.M.E.", "AuthorID": "57198058937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "7202914994": {"Name": "Clarke T.M.", "AuthorID": "7202914994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "24821388000": {"Name": "Dimitrov S.D.", "AuthorID": "24821388000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "10043053200": {"Name": "Ashraf R.S.", "AuthorID": "10043053200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "56401622800": {"Name": "Durrant J.R.", "AuthorID": "56401622800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "56780318200": {"Name": "Wijeyasinghe N.", "AuthorID": "56780318200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "55328853400": {"Name": "Guilbert A.A.Y.", "AuthorID": "55328853400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "55665151000": {"Name": "Nelson J.", "AuthorID": "55665151000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "6701337286": {"Name": "Anthopoulos T.D.", "AuthorID": "6701337286", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "56045648600": {"Name": "Manley E.F.", "AuthorID": "56045648600", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "55222394000": {"Name": "Chen L.X.", "AuthorID": "55222394000", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "7102088807": {"Name": "Marks T.J.", "AuthorID": "7102088807", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Research Center, Argonne-Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center, Northwestern University"}, "36979389600": {"Name": "Al-Hashimi M.", "AuthorID": "36979389600", "AffiliationID": "60072753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Texas AandM University at Qatar"}, "56785719800": {"Name": "Yousaf S.A.", "AuthorID": "56785719800", "AffiliationID": "60037950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Government College University"}, "57195623421": {"Name": "Duffy W.", "AuthorID": "57195623421", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SPERC, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "57216793729": {"Name": "McCulloch I.", "AuthorID": "57216793729", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SPERC, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}}}
