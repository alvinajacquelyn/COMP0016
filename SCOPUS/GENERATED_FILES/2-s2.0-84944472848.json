Although the pneumococcal population structure and evolutionary genetics are well defined, it is not clear whether pneumococci that cause meningitis are genetically distinct from those that do not. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing of 140 isolates of S. pneumoniae recovered from bloodstream infection (n = 70) and meningitis (n = 70) to compare their genetic contents. By fitting a double-exponential decaying-function model, we show that these isolates share a core of 1,427 genes (95% confidence interval [CI], 1,425 to 1,435 genes) and that there is no difference in the core genome or accessory gene content from these disease manifestations. Gene presence/absence alone therefore does not explain the virulence behavior of pneumococci that reach the meninges. Our analysis, however, supports the requirement of a range of previously described virulence factors and vaccine candidates for both meningitis- and bacteremia-causing pneumococci. This high-resolution view suggests that, despite considerable competency for genetic exchange, all pneumococci are under considerable pressure to retain key components advantageous for colonization and transmission and that these components are essential for access to and survival in sterile sites.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteremia", "Bacterial Proteins", "Genome, Bacterial", "Genomics", "Humans", "Meningitis", "Streptococcal Infections", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944472848", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55908468000": {"Name": "Kulohoma B.W.", "AuthorID": "55908468000", "AffiliationID": "60048717, 60051492", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, University of Nairobi, International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology"}, "38662303900": {"Name": "Cornick J.E.", "AuthorID": "38662303900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "56685561800": {"Name": "Chaguza C.", "AuthorID": "56685561800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "56906783900": {"Name": "Kiran A.M.", "AuthorID": "56906783900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "19933714900": {"Name": "Everett D.B.", "AuthorID": "19933714900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "56906956600": {"Name": "Heydermana R.S.", "AuthorID": "56906956600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "34975060700": {"Name": "French N.", "AuthorID": "34975060700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7102548116": {"Name": "Bentley S.D.", "AuthorID": "7102548116", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "57213449590": {"Name": "Yalcin F.", "AuthorID": "57213449590", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "35277976300": {"Name": "Harris S.R.", "AuthorID": "35277976300", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "57212237926": {"Name": "Parkhill J.", "AuthorID": "57212237926", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "34769599200": {"Name": "Gray K.J.", "AuthorID": "34769599200", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7004716450": {"Name": "Molyneux E.", "AuthorID": "7004716450", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7003911879": {"Name": "Faragher B.E.", "AuthorID": "7003911879", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}}}
