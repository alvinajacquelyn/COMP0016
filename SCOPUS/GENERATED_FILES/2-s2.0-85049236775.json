To the best of our knowledge, this association has not previously been described, although other abnormalities of the left pulmonary artery in the setting of vascular rings have been reported. We review the embryology, utility of imaging, and clinical course.", "AuthorKeywords": ["congenital heart disease", "patent arterial duct", "pulmonary artery abnormalities", "vascular ring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fatal Outcome", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Male", "Pulmonary Artery", "Syndrome", "Vascular Malformations", "Vascular Ring"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049236775", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"37102871400": {"Name": "Thankavel P.P.", "AuthorID": "37102871400", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602467307": {"Name": "Guleserian K.J.", "AuthorID": "6602467307", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": null}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": null}}}
