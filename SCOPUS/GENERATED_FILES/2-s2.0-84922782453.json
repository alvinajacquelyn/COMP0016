The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) is a composite measure of disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis. The aims of this study were to determine the most appropriate method for calculating the ASDAS using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level when the conventional CRP level was below the limit of detection, to determine how low CRP values obtained by high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurement influence ASDAS-CRP results, and to test agreement between different ASDAS formulae. Methods. Patients with axial spondyloarthritis who had a conventional CRP level below the limit of detection (5 mg/liter) were selected (n = 257). The ASDAS-conventional CRP with 11 different imputations for the conventional CRP value (range 0-5 mg/liter, at 0.5-mg/liter intervals) was calculated. The ASDAS-hsCRP and ASDAS using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were also calculated. Agreement between the ASDAS formulae was tested. Results. The ASDAS-hsCRP showed better agreement with the ASDAS-CRP calculated using the conventional CRP imputation values of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/liter and with the ASDAS-ESR than with other imputed formulae. Disagreement occurred mainly in lower disease activity states (inactive/moderate disease activity). When the CRP value was <2 mg/liter, the resulting ASDAS-CRP scores may have been inappropriately low. Conclusion. When the conventional CRP level is below the limit of detection or when the hsCRP level is <2 mg/liter, the constant value of 2 mg/liter should be used to calculate the ASDAS-CRP score. There is good agreement between the ASDAS-hsCRP and ASDAS-ESR; however, formulae are not interchangeable.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Markers", "Blood Sedimentation", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "France", "Humans", "Limit of Detection", "Mathematics", "Models, Biological", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Severity of Illness Index", "Spondylitis, Ankylosing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922782453", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"35243075300": {"Name": "Machado P.", "AuthorID": "35243075300", "AffiliationID": "60020985", "AffiliationName": "University of Coimbra"}, "16024853100": {"Name": "Navarro-Comp\u00e1n V.", "AuthorID": "16024853100", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital la Paz"}, "6602606299": {"Name": "Van Gaalen F.A.", "AuthorID": "6602606299", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "35380236300": {"Name": "Van Der Heijde D.", "AuthorID": "35380236300", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7006658098": {"Name": "Landew\u00e9 R.", "AuthorID": "7006658098", "AffiliationID": "60002051", "AffiliationName": "Atrium Medical Center"}, "14054986200": {"Name": "Roux C.", "AuthorID": "14054986200", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University"}}}
