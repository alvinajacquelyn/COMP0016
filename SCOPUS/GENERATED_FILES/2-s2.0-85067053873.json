Representing and perceiving these areas to reason about potential contact between a robot and its surrounding environment, is still largely an open problem. This paper introduces a new framework to model and map local rough terrain surfaces, for tasks such as bipedal robot foot placement. The system operates in real-time, on data from an RGB-D and an IMU sensor. We introduce a set of parametrized patch models and an algorithm to fit them in the environment. Potential contacts are identified as bounded curved patches of approximately the same size as the robot's foot sole. This includes sparse seed point sampling, point cloud neighborhood search, and patch fitting and validation. We also present a mapping and tracking system, where patches are maintained in a local spatial map around the robot as it moves. A bio-inspired sampling algorithm is introduced for finding salient contacts. We include a dense volumetric fusion layer for spatiotemporally tracking, using multiple depth data to reconstruct a local point cloud. We present experimental results on a mini-biped robot that performs foot placements on rocks, implementing a 3D foothold perception system, that uses the developed patch mapping and tracking framework.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D perception for bipedal robots", "Bipedal robot foot placement", "Bounded curved patch modeling", "Curved patch fitting and tracking", "Foothold contact modeling", "Irregular surface modeling", "Legged robot locomotion", "Rough terrain stepping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bipedal robot", "Contact modeling", "Curved patches", "Foot placements", "Irregular surface", "Legged robots", "Rough terrains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067053873", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"26023306800": {"Name": "Kanoulas D.", "AuthorID": "26023306800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoids and Human-Centered Mechatronics Lab, Instituto Italiano di Technologia, Via Morego 30"}, "56275172000": {"Name": "Tsagarakis N.G.", "AuthorID": "56275172000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoids and Human-Centered Mechatronics Lab, Instituto Italiano di Technologia, Via Morego 30"}, "6602732245": {"Name": "Vona M.", "AuthorID": "6602732245", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60016296", "AffiliationName": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena"}}}
