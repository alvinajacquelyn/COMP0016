Organizations providing services to ID patients are complex and have many interacting stakeholders with often different and competing interests. Understanding the causes for failures in complex systems is crucial for appreciating the multiple perspectives of the key stakeholders of the system. Knowing the factors that adversely affect delivery of a patient-centred care by ID provider organizations offers the potential for identifying more effective resource-allocation solutions. The authors suggest cognitive mapping as a starting point for system dynamics modelling of optimal resource-allocation projects in ID care. The application of the method is illustrated via a case study in one of the ID care providers in the Netherlands. The paper discusses some of the practical implications of applying problem-structuring methods that support gathering feedback from vulnerable service users and front-line workers. The authors concluded that cognitive mapping technique can assist the management of healthcare organizations in strategic decision-making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive mapping", "Intellectual disability care", "Resource planning", "SODA", "Stakeholder participation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making, Organizational", "Focus Groups", "Health Planning", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Interviews as Topic", "Netherlands", "Organizational Case Studies", "Patient-Centered Care", "Resource Allocation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932195080", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"55243351300": {"Name": "Duryan M.", "AuthorID": "55243351300", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Gouverneur Kremers Centrum-Department of Methodology and Statistics, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Maastricht"}, "6504299883": {"Name": "Nikolik D.", "AuthorID": "6504299883", "AffiliationID": "60013974", "AffiliationName": "Management Information Systems, Maastricht School of Management"}, "6701556768": {"Name": "van Merode G.", "AuthorID": "6701556768", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Maastricht"}, "7003691141": {"Name": "Curfs L.", "AuthorID": "7003691141", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Gouverneur Kremers Centrum, Maastricht University Medical Center"}}}
