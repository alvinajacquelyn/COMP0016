It begins by sketching the pre-war background, focusing first on the availability of European goods in North America and the Caribbean and then on British debates about foreign commodity penetration of the Atlantic colonies. The next part charts the emergence after 1763 of a political consensus in London on the need to give British goods added advantage in American markets. The article goes on to suggest reasons for the forming of this consensus, and finally considers the success of the measures introduced by British governments to diminish colonial purchases of European products.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937888982", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"8594372100": {"Name": "Conway S.", "AuthorID": "8594372100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "History Department, University College London"}}}
