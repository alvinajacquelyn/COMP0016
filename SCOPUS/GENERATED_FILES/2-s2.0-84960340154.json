This process gave the highest solubilisation of pectin oligomers at a relatively low pressure and longer time (5 Bar, 24 min), whilst leaving the majority of the cellulose fraction intact. This method of steam pre-treatment fits into the concept of a sugar beet biorefinery as it valorises an existing waste stream without requiring any further physical processing such as milling or dilution with water. The residual cellulose fraction was enriched in cellulose and could be effectively fermented into ethanol by yeast after enzymatic digestion, producing 0.48 g ethanol per gram of glucose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biorefinery", "Design of experiments", "Ethanol fermentation", "Steam explosion", "Sugar Beet Pulp"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biorefineries", "Chemical feedstocks", "Enzymatic digestions", "Ethanol fermentation", "Selective extraction", "Steam explosion", "Steam pre treatments", "Sugar beet pulp", "Arabinose", "Beta vulgaris", "Bioreactors", "Carbohydrates", "Chemical Fractionation", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Ethanol", "Fermentation", "Hydrolysis", "Models, Theoretical", "Proteins", "Reproducibility of Results", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Solubility", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960340154", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"]], "AuthorData": {"57163711800": {"Name": "Hamley-Bennett C.", "AuthorID": "57163711800", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"}, "7007046907": {"Name": "Leak D.", "AuthorID": "7007046907", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
