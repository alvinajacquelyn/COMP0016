We have previously suggested that this association is due to delayed primacy performance indexing memory consolidation, which in turn is thought to depend upon hippocampal function. Here, we test the hypothesis that hippocampal size is associated with delayed primacy performance in cognitively intact elderly individuals.Data were analyzed from a group (. N=81) of cognitively intact participants, aged 60 or above. Serial position performance was measured with the Buschke selective reminding test (BSRT). Hippocampal size was automatically measured via MRI, and unbiased voxel-based analyses were also conducted to explore further regional specificity of memory performance. We conducted regression analyses of hippocampus volumes on serial position performance; other predictors included age, family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD), APOE \u03b54 status, education, and total intracranial volume.Our results collectively suggest that there is a preferential association between hippocampal volume and delayed primacy performance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that delayed primacy consolidation is associated with hippocampal size, and shed light on the relationship between delayed primacy performance and generalized cognitive decline in cognitively intact individuals, suggesting that delayed primacy consolidation may serve as a sensitive marker of hippocampal health in these individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "Primacy", "Serial position", "Structural MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Organ Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921502207", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"37114115000": {"Name": "Bruno D.", "AuthorID": "37114115000", "AffiliationID": "60105090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Liverpool Hope University"}, "36174929100": {"Name": "Grothe M.", "AuthorID": "36174929100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) - Rostock/Greifswald"}, "7004435774": {"Name": "Teipel S.", "AuthorID": "7004435774", "AffiliationID": "60003615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, University of Rostock"}, "6601979992": {"Name": "Nierenberg J.", "AuthorID": "6601979992", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, New York University"}, "7005360684": {"Name": "Pomara N.", "AuthorID": "7005360684", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, New York University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy University of Gothenburg"}}}
