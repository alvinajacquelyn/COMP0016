This study compared the effects of brief interventions with different education, indirect and imagined contact components on lay people's attitudes. Materials and Methods: 401 adult participants were randomised to six digital brief interventions consisting of different combinations of education, indirect and imagined contact. Their attitudes, intergroup anxiety and social distance were assessed post-intervention and at four to six-week follow-up. Results: An intervention combining film-based education about intellectual disability and indirect contact had small positive effects on all three outcomes. Social distance was further reduced with the addition of a positively toned imagined contact task. These effects were maintained at follow-up. Conclusions: A brief film-based digital intervention can have small positive effects on attitudes to people with intellectual disabilities. These may be enhanced by adding positive imagined contact.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes", "contact", "education", "intellectual disability", "intervention", "stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Attitude", "Female", "Health Education", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Social Distance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019199333", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57194206138": {"Name": "Lindau N.", "AuthorID": "57194206138", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57220376210": {"Name": "Amin T.", "AuthorID": "57220376210", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57194218490": {"Name": "Zambon A.", "AuthorID": "57194218490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
