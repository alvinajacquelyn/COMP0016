However, a significant proportion of those adults are subsequently found to develop mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or other neurocognitive disorder. In other cases, SCD may be associated with mood, personality, and physical health concerns. Regardless of etiology, adults with SCD may benefit from interventions that could enhance current function or slow incipient cognitive decline. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, is to examine the benefits of non-pharmacologic intervention (NPI) in persons with SCD. Inclusion criteria were studies of adults aged 55 + with SCD defined using published criteria, receiving NPI or any control condition, with cognitive, behavioural, or psychological outcomes in controlled trails. Published empirical studies were obtained through a standardized search of CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE with Full Text, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES, supplemented by a manual retrieval of relevant articles. Study quality and bias was determined using PEDro. Nine studies were included in the review and meta-analysis. A wide range of study quality was observed. Overall, a small effect size was found on cognitive outcomes, greater for cognitive versus other intervention types. The available evidence suggests that NPI may benefit current cognitive function in persons with SCD. Recommendations are provided to improve future trials of NPI in SCD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Cognitive interventions", "Complementary therapies", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Treatment outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Behavior Therapy", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Complementary Therapies", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014580325", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"]], "AuthorData": {"22981376400": {"Name": "Smart C.M.", "AuthorID": "22981376400", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health, University of Victoria"}, "54880256000": {"Name": "Karr J.E.", "AuthorID": "54880256000", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Victoria"}, "55923565800": {"Name": "Areshenkoff C.N.", "AuthorID": "55923565800", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Victoria"}, "57191479217": {"Name": "Ali J.I.", "AuthorID": "57191479217", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Victoria"}, "7003690340": {"Name": "Rabin L.A.", "AuthorID": "7003690340", "AffiliationID": "60007033, 60032373, 60023814", "AffiliationName": "Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center of The City University of New York"}, "7004094444": {"Name": "Hudon C.", "AuthorID": "7004094444", "AffiliationID": "60009441", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche de l\u2019Institut Universitaire en Sant\u00e9 Mentale de Qu\u00e9bec"}, "35268279500": {"Name": "Gates N.", "AuthorID": "35268279500", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "University of New South Wales"}, "35749543200": {"Name": "Arenaza-Urquijo E.M.", "AuthorID": "35749543200", "AffiliationID": "60005384", "AffiliationName": "CHU de Caen, U1077"}, "6603448185": {"Name": "Chetelat G.", "AuthorID": "6603448185", "AffiliationID": "60005384", "AffiliationName": "CHU de Caen, U1077"}, "55792449200": {"Name": "Buckley R.F.", "AuthorID": "55792449200", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "56820298200": {"Name": "Hampel H.", "AuthorID": "56820298200", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60120341", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Memory and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (IM2A) and Brain and Spine Institute (ICM) UMR S 1127, Department of Neurology, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re University Hospital"}, "7006672877": {"Name": "Jessen F.", "AuthorID": "7006672877", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "23992626100": {"Name": "Marchant N.L.", "AuthorID": "23992626100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "22035912000": {"Name": "Sikkes S.A.M.", "AuthorID": "22035912000", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "van der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "57193525614": {"Name": "Wesselman L.", "AuthorID": "57193525614", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "6602607213": {"Name": "Tales A.", "AuthorID": "6602607213", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Swansea University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
