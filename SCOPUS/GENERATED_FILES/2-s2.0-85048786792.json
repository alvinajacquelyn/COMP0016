We measured the \u03b413Ccellulose and \u03b418Ocellulose values of bulk cellulose and moss fragments from an \u223c11.4ka-long core obtained from a shallow, productive, spring-fed, hardwater lake, \u00c4ntu Sinij\u00e4rv, Estonia (59\u02da3.8\u2032N; 26\u02da14.5\u2032E; 94.6 m a.s.l.; maximum depth 7.3 m), in order to reconstruct regional Holocene climate and lake-basin evolution. Isotopically, the modern waterbody is a well-behaved, open, hydrological system with negligible evaporative effects. Cellulose-isotope records were compared with down-core measurements of loss-on-ignition (LOI), carbonate and mineral contents, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, \u03b413CTOC, biomarker indices (Palg and Paq), published palaeoecological data and a \u03b418Ocarbonate record from the same palaeolake. Green microalgae, freshwater macroalgae (Chara) and aquatic bryophytes were important sources of sedimentary cellulose during different phases in the environmental history of the lake. Although a strong palaeoclimatic imprint can be detected in the \u03b418Ocellulose record from \u00c4ntu Sinij\u00e4rv, notably the Preboreal oscillation, the 8.2ka event and an unnamed cold oscillation \u223c3.25ka BP, the isotopic signal of these events may have been amplified by increases in 18O-depleted spring snowmelt. In contrast, \u03b413Ccellulose was tightly coupled to the Holocene evolution of terrestrial ecosystems and soils by significant inputs of biogenic carbon from the catchment and sublacustrine springs. During the early Holocene, \u223c11 \u2013 9ka BP, the \u03b418Ocellulose and \u03b418Ocarbonate records diverge markedly, which can be attributed to \u201cno-analogue\u201d seasonal, climatic, hydrological and isotopic conditions resulting from orbital forcing and residual ice-sheet impacts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Changing climate", "Core measurements", "Environmental history", "Holocene climate", "Hydrological system", "Organic matter source", "Terrestrial ecosystems", "Total Organic Carbon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048786792", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"7004697981": {"Name": "Street-Perrott F.", "AuthorID": "7004697981", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, College of Science, Swansea University"}, "8915901800": {"Name": "Robertson I.", "AuthorID": "8915901800", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, College of Science, Swansea University"}, "35584623800": {"Name": "Ficken K.", "AuthorID": "35584623800", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, College of Science, Swansea University"}, "6603335688": {"Name": "Loader N.", "AuthorID": "6603335688", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, College of Science, Swansea University"}, "7403240604": {"Name": "Holmes J.", "AuthorID": "7403240604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "56020409300": {"Name": "Koff T.", "AuthorID": "56020409300", "AffiliationID": "60068878", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ecology, Tallinn University"}, "55471965500": {"Name": "Marshall J.", "AuthorID": "55471965500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "6603587341": {"Name": "Martma T.", "AuthorID": "6603587341", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Tallinn University of Technology"}}}
