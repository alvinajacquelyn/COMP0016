Unfortunately, the available commercial immunoassays are labour intensive, require large sample volumes, and have practical limitations, such as low stability and high production costs. Hence, we have developed a simple, cost effective, and label-free electrochemical immunoassay for the measurement of CRP in a drop of serum sample using an immunosensor strip made up of a screen printed carbon electrode (SPE) modified with anti-CRP functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The measurement relies on the decrease of the oxidation current of the redox indicator Fe3+/Fe2+, resulting from the immunoreaction between CRP and anti-CRP. Under optimal conditions, the present immunoassay measures CRP in a linear range from 0.4-200 nM (0.047-23.6 \u03bcg mL-1), with a detection limit of 0.15 nM (17 ng mL-1, S/N = 3) and sensitivity of 90.7 nA nM1, in addition to a good reproducibility and storage stability. The analytical applicability of the presented immunoassay is verified by CRP measurements in human blood serum samples. This work provides the basis for a low-priced, safe, and easy-to-use point-of-care immunosensor assay to measure CRP at clinically relevant concentrations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-reactive protein", "Electrochemical assay", "Gold nanoparticles", "Label-free Immunosensor", "Screen printed electrode (SPE)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biosensing Techniques", "C-Reactive Protein", "Electrochemical Techniques", "Gold", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Metal Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044824375", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"55365175500": {"Name": "Thangamuthu M.", "AuthorID": "55365175500", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "8520858000": {"Name": "Santschi C.", "AuthorID": "8520858000", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "7102395712": {"Name": "Martin O.", "AuthorID": "7102395712", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)"}}}
