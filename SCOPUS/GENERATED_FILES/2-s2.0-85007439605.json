Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseMitochondrial trafficking is influenced by neuronal activity, but it remains unclear how mitochondrial positioning influences neuronal transmission and plasticity. Here, we use live cell imaging with the genetically encoded presynaptically targeted Ca2+ indicator, SyGCaMP5, to address whether presynaptic Ca2+ responses are altered by mitochondria in synaptic terminals. We find that presynaptic Ca2+ signals, as well as neurotransmitter release, are significantly decreased in terminals containing mitochondria. Moreover, the localisation of mitochondria at presynaptic sites can be altered during long-term activity changes, dependent on the Ca2+-sensing function of the mitochondrial trafficking protein, Miro1. In addition, we find that Miro1-mediated activity-dependent synaptic repositioning of mitochondria allows neurons to homeostatically alter the strength of presynaptic Ca2+ signals in response to prolonged changes in neuronal activity. Our results support a model in which mitochondria are recruited to presynaptic terminals during periods of raised neuronal activity and are involved in rescaling synaptic signals during homeostatic plasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["homeostatic", "Miro1", "mitochondria", "plasticity", "synapse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Expression", "Homeostasis", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Rats", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "rho GTP-Binding Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007439605", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55816865000": {"Name": "Vaccaro V.", "AuthorID": "55816865000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "35889193800": {"Name": "Devine M.", "AuthorID": "35889193800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55933885900": {"Name": "Higgs N.", "AuthorID": "55933885900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102315993": {"Name": "Kittler J.", "AuthorID": "7102315993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
