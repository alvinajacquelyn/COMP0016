Recently, fixed type wind turbines have been used to harvest offshore wind energy. To transport supplies such as food, equipment, and chemicals, offshore supply vessels (OSVs) regularly visit offshore platforms. Depending on environmental conditions and operational errors, collisions between OSVs and offshore platforms can occur. Such collisions result in the structural damage of local members, such as columns and braces, which can reduce the safety and integrity of the entire structural system. Various causes of collisions are considered relevant, such as human error, engine and equipment failure, and harsh environmental conditions. The dynamic and unpredictable nature of weather conditions must also be considered in association with volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environments. This chapter describes an advanced methodology for determining the design loads of collisions between OSVs and fixed (jacket) type offshore platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070689085", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
