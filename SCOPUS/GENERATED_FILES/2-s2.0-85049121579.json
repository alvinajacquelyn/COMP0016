Apart from inappropriate therapies, which are inherent to the presence of a defibrillator, whether adding defibrillator to CRT in the primary prevention setting impacts risk of other acute and late device-related complications has not been well studied and may bear relevance for device selection. Methods: Observational multicentre European cohort study of 3008 consecutive patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and no history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias, undergoing CRT implantation with (CRT-D, n=1785) or without (CRT-P, n=1223) defibrillator. Using propensity score and competing risk analyses, we assessed the risk of significant device-related complications requiring surgical reintervention. Inappropriate shocks were not considered except those due to lead malfunction requiring lead revision. Results: Acute complications occurred in 148 patients (4.9%), without significant difference between groups, even after considering potential confounders (OR=1.20, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.00, p=0.47). During a mean follow-up of 41.4\u00b129 months, late complications occurred in 475 patients, giving an annual incidence rate of 26 (95% CI 9 to 43) and 15 (95% CI 6 to 24) per 1000 patient-years in CRT-D and CRT-P patients, respectively. CRT-D was independently associated with increased occurrence of late complications (HR=1.68, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.23, p=0.001). In particular, when compared with CRT-P, CRT-D was associated with an increased risk of device-related infection (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.45, p=0.004). Acute complications did not predict overall late complications, but predicted device-related infection (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.56, p<0.001). Conclusions: Compared with CRT-P, CRT-D is associated with a similar risk of periprocedural complications but increased risk of long-term complications, mainly infection. This needs to be considered in the decision of implanting CRT with or without a defibrillator.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heart failure", "implanted cardiac defibrillators", "pacemakers", "quality and outcomes of care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pacemaker, Artificial", "Primary Prevention", "Propensity Score", "Risk Factors", "Tachycardia, Ventricular", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049121579", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"37025430000": {"Name": "Barra S.", "AuthorID": "37025430000", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23033889600": {"Name": "Duehmke R.", "AuthorID": "23033889600", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54941115400": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Panizo J.", "AuthorID": "54941115400", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23102885200": {"Name": "Heck P.", "AuthorID": "23102885200", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16644223300": {"Name": "Virdee M.", "AuthorID": "16644223300", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15769947600": {"Name": "Provid\u00eancia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "16063029200": {"Name": "Chow A.W.", "AuthorID": "16063029200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6701478201": {"Name": "Boveda S.", "AuthorID": "6701478201", "AffiliationID": "60007745", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Clinique Pasteur"}, "57042348100": {"Name": "Narayanan K.", "AuthorID": "57042348100", "AffiliationID": "120096580", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, MaxCure Hospitals"}, "12143483700": {"Name": "Marijon E.", "AuthorID": "12143483700", "AffiliationID": "60030857", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, European Georges Pompidou Hospital"}, "7006174412": {"Name": "Piot O.", "AuthorID": "7006174412", "AffiliationID": "60032103", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Centre Cardiologique du Nord"}, "7006022938": {"Name": "Klug D.", "AuthorID": "7006022938", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Lille University Hospital"}, "7003896138": {"Name": "Defaye P.", "AuthorID": "7003896138", "AffiliationID": "60005851", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Grenoble University Hospital"}, "7004683240": {"Name": "Gras D.", "AuthorID": "7004683240", "AffiliationID": "118272512", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Nouvelles Cliniques Nantaises"}, "7004231392": {"Name": "Deharo J.C.", "AuthorID": "7004231392", "AffiliationID": "60024144", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, La Timone University Hospital"}, "57200501755": {"Name": "Milliez P.", "AuthorID": "57200501755", "AffiliationID": "60005384", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Caen University Hospital"}, "35577317600": {"Name": "Da Costa A.", "AuthorID": "35577317600", "AffiliationID": "60031218", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, St Etienne University Hospital"}, "24166937600": {"Name": "Mondoly P.", "AuthorID": "24166937600", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Toulouse University Hospital"}, "7006426549": {"Name": "Leclercq C.", "AuthorID": "7006426549", "AffiliationID": "60028893", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Rennes University Hospital"}, "7005602491": {"Name": "Sadoul N.", "AuthorID": "7005602491", "AffiliationID": "60020606", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Nancy University Hospital"}, "7005514655": {"Name": "Le Heuzey J.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005514655", "AffiliationID": "60030857", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, European Georges Pompidou Hospital"}}}
