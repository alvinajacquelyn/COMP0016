Using nationally representative linked employer-employee data we estimate the PP premium at the mean and across the wage distribution, after accounting for workplace heterogeneity. We then present the effects of PP on the wage distribution. Failure to account for the use of PP in high paying workplaces overstates the PP premium by one-third. The premium rises as one moves up the wage distribution, but the effect is more modest after having accounted for workplace heterogeneity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041958199", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "57154476100": {"Name": "Forth J.", "AuthorID": "57154476100", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "55453944500": {"Name": "Stokes L.", "AuthorID": "55453944500", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}}}
