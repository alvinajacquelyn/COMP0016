Purpose: To evaluate auditory perception in a group of older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Research Design: A cross-sectional study of auditory perception. Study Sample: Adults with MCI and adults with no documented cognitive issues and matched hearing sensitivity and age. Data collection: Auditory perception was evaluated in both groups, assessing for hearing sensitivity, speech in babble (SinB), and temporal resolution. Results: Mann-Whitney test revealed significantly poorer scores for SinB and temporal resolution abilities of MCIs versus normal controls for both ears. The right-ear gap detection thresholds on the Gaps-In- Noise (GIN) Test clearly differentiated between the two groups (p < 0.001), with no overlap of values. The left ear results also differentiated the two groups (p < 0.01); however, there was a small degree of overlap z8-msec threshold values. With the exception of the left-ear inattentiveness index, which showed a similar distribution between groups, both impulsivity and inattentiveness indexes were higher for the MCIs compared to the control group. Conclusions: The results support central auditory processing evaluation in the elderly population as a promising tool to achieve earlier diagnosis of dementia, while identifying central auditory processing deficits that can contribute to communication deficits in the MCI patient population. A measure of temporal resolution (GIN) may offer an early, albeit indirect, measure reflecting left temporal cortical thinning associated with the transition between MCI and Alzheimer's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Auditory processing disorder", "Diagnostic techniques", "Elderly", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Temporal resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Audiometry, Pure-Tone", "Auditory Perception", "Auditory Perceptual Disorders", "Auditory Threshold", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Processes", "Middle Aged", "Noise", "Perceptual Masking", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019914808", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"6602345724": {"Name": "Iliadou V.", "AuthorID": "6602345724", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57189342958": {"Name": "Sidiras C.", "AuthorID": "57189342958", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57194387153": {"Name": "Moschopoulos N.P.", "AuthorID": "57194387153", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6507583540": {"Name": "Nimatoudis I.", "AuthorID": "6507583540", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "7004174854": {"Name": "Tsolaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004174854", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "3rd Department of Neurology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7003612597": {"Name": "Chermak G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003612597", "AffiliationID": "60013851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, Washington State University Health Sciences"}}}
