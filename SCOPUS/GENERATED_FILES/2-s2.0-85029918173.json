Pr has an approximate doublet ground state and the first excited state is a singlet. While the B-site (Ru) is well ordered throughout, this is not the case for the A-site (Pr/Bi). A broadened distribution for the Pr-O2 bond length at low temperature indicates the Pr environment varies from site to site even for x=0. The environment about the Bi site is highly disordered ostensibly due to the 6s lone pairs on Bi3+. Correspondingly, we find that the non-Kramers doublet ground-state degeneracy, otherwise anticipated for Pr in the pyrochlore structure, is lifted so as to produce a quadrupolar singlet ground state with a spatially varying energy gap. For x=0, below TN, the Ru sublattice orders antiferromagnetically, with propagation vector k=(0,0,0) as for Y2Ru2O7. No ordering associated with the Pr sublattice is observed down to 100 mK. The low-energy magnetic response of Pr2-xBixRu2O7 features a broad spectrum of magnetic excitations associated with inhomogeneous splitting of the Pr quasidoublet ground state. For x=0 (x=0.97), the spectrum is temperature dependent (independent). It appears disorder associated with Bi alloying enhances the inhomogeneous Pr crystal-field level splitting so that intersite interactions become irrelevant for x=0.97. The structural complexity for the A-site may be reflected in the hysteretic uniform magnetization of B-site ruthenium in the N\u00e9el phase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystal-field levels", "Doublet ground state", "Extended X-ray absorption fine structures", "Magnetic excitations", "Pyrochlore structures", "Singlet ground state", "Structural complexity", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029918173", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"6701628711": {"Name": "Van Duijn J.", "AuthorID": "6701628711", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Mec\u00e1nica, Universidad de C\u00f3rdoba"}, "7005471548": {"Name": "Adroja D.T.", "AuthorID": "7005471548", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56110123600": {"Name": "Daoud-Aladine A.", "AuthorID": "56110123600", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55924594300": {"Name": "Fernandez-Alonso F.", "AuthorID": "55924594300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005368625": {"Name": "Perring T.G.", "AuthorID": "7005368625", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55822965423": {"Name": "Kim K.H.", "AuthorID": "55822965423", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "CeNSCMR, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University"}, "7005623089": {"Name": "Hur N.", "AuthorID": "7005623089", "AffiliationID": "60120555, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Rutgers Center for Emergent Materials, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University"}, "57205982477": {"Name": "Cheong S.W.", "AuthorID": "57205982477", "AffiliationID": "60120555, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Rutgers Center for Emergent Materials, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University"}, "6506152437": {"Name": "Ruiz-Bustos R.", "AuthorID": "6506152437", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Mec\u00e1nica, Universidad de C\u00f3rdoba"}, "7005144119": {"Name": "Bridges F.", "AuthorID": "7005144119", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of California"}, "56449200500": {"Name": "Kearney V.", "AuthorID": "56449200500", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of California"}, "55208639200": {"Name": "Wen J.J.", "AuthorID": "55208639200", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Quantum Matter, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University"}, "57216599066": {"Name": "Broholm C.", "AuthorID": "57216599066", "AffiliationID": "60015645, 60023053", "AffiliationName": "NIST Center for Neutron Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "56508703200": {"Name": "Huang Q.Z.", "AuthorID": "56508703200", "AffiliationID": "60015645, 60023053", "AffiliationName": "NIST Center for Neutron Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}}}
