The signature transforms a path into a group-like element in the tensor algebra and is an essential object in rough path theory. The expected signature of a stochastic process plays a similar role to that played by the characteristic function of a random variable. In [Chevyrev (2013)], it is proved that under certain boundedness conditions, the expected value of a random signature already determines the law of this random signature. It becomes of great interest to be able to compute examples of expected signatures and obtain the upper bounds for the decay rates of expected signatures. For instance, the computation for Brownian motion on [0, 1] leads to the \"cubature on Wiener space\" methodology [Lyons and Victoir, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 460 (2004) 169-198]. In this paper we fix a bounded domain \u0393 in a Euclidean space E and study the expected signature of a Brownian path starting at z \u03b5 \u0393 and stopped at the first exit time from \u0393. We denote this tensor series valued function by \u03a6\u0393(z) and focus on the case E = Rd . We show that \u03a6\u0393(z) satisfies an elliptic PDE system and a boundary condition. The equations determining \u03a6\u0393 can be recursively solved; by an iterative application of Sobolev estimates we are able, under certain smoothness and boundedness condition of the domain \u0393, to prove geometric bounds for the terms in \u03a6\u0393(z). However, there is still a gap and we have not shown that \u03a6\u0393(z) determines the law of the signature of this stopped Brownian motion even if \u0393 is a unit ball.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cubature", "Diffusion", "Expected signature", "Rough path"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947729964", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"7101688817": {"Name": "Lyons T.", "AuthorID": "7101688817", "AffiliationID": "60112639, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance, University of Oxford"}, "56499922900": {"Name": "Ni H.", "AuthorID": "56499922900", "AffiliationID": "60112639, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance, University of Oxford"}}}
