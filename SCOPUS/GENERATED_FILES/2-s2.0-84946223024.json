To further map out this variability, we compared five commonly used mouse strains: C57BL/6, 129SVJ, BALB/c, CD1 and FVB in a pure hypoxic-ischemic setup and following pre-sensitization with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Postnatal day 7 pups were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by continuous 30. min 8% oxygen exposure at 36. \u00b0C. Twelve hours prior, a third of the pups received a single intraperitoneal LPS (0.6. \u03bcg/g) or a saline (vehicle) administration, respectively; a further third underwent hypoxia-ischemia alone without preceding injection. Both C57BL/6 and 129SVJ strains showed minimal response to 30. min hypoxia-ischemia alone, BALB/c demonstrated a moderate response, and both CD1 and FVB revealed the highest brain damage. LPS pre-sensitization led to substantial increase in overall brain infarction, microglial and astrocyte response and cell death in four of the five strains, with exception of BALB/c that only showed a significant effect with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Saline administration prior to hypoxia-ischemia resulted in an increase in inflammatory-associated markers, particularly in the astroglial activation of C57BL/6 mice, and in combined microglial activation and neuronal cell loss in FVB mice. Finally, two of the four strongly affected strains - C57BL/6 and CD1 - revealed pronounced contralateral astrogliosis with a neuroanatomical localization similar to that observed on the occluded hemisphere.Overall, the current findings demonstrate strain differences in response to hypoxia-ischemia alone, to stress associated with vehicle injection, and to LPS-mediated pre-sensitization, which partially explains the high variability seen in the neonatal mouse models of hypoxia-ischemia. These results can be useful in future studies of fetal/neonatal response to inflammation and reduced oxygen-blood supply.", "AuthorKeywords": ["129SVJ", "BALB/c", "C57BL/6", "CD1", "FVB", "Hypoxia-ischemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Brain", "Carotid Artery Diseases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946223024", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55110477100": {"Name": "Rocha-Ferreira E.", "AuthorID": "55110477100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57198142001": {"Name": "Phillips E.", "AuthorID": "57198142001", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56943451200": {"Name": "Francesch-Domenech E.", "AuthorID": "56943451200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55338411600": {"Name": "Thei L.", "AuthorID": "55338411600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "35373101700": {"Name": "Raivich G.", "AuthorID": "35373101700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
