The system performance is evaluated at the system level through a global connectivity performance indicator, which depends on both physical damages to its components and induced functionality losses due to interactions with other systems. An object-oriented modeling paradigm is used, where the complex problem of several interacting systems is decomposed in a number of interacting objects, accounting for intra- and interdependencies between and within systems. Each system is specified with its components, solving algorithms, performance indicators and interactions with other systems. The proposed approach is implemented for the analysis of the road network in the city of Thessaloniki (Greece) to demonstrate its applicability. In particular, the risk for the road network in the area is calculated, specifically focusing on the short-term impact of seismic events (just after the earthquake). The potential of road blockages due to collapses of adjacent buildings and overpass bridges is analyzed, trying to individuate possible criticalities related to specific components/subsystems. The application can be extended based on the proposed approach, to account for other interactions such as failure of pipelines beneath the road segments, collapse of adjacent electric poles, or malfunction of lighting and signaling systems due to damage in the electric power network.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electric power networks", "Global connectivity", "Ground motion intensities", "Integrated approach", "Network functionality", "Object oriented model", "Performance indicators", "Seismic risk assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931955355", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"15080587800": {"Name": "Argyroudis S.", "AuthorID": "15080587800", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6701399637": {"Name": "Pitilakis K.", "AuthorID": "6701399637", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7005448100": {"Name": "Selva J.", "AuthorID": "7005448100", "AffiliationID": "60000243", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"}, "23970419400": {"Name": "Gehl P.", "AuthorID": "23970419400", "AffiliationID": "60004967", "AffiliationName": "BRGM"}}}
