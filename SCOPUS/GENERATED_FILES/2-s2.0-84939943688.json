Circulating amino acids (AAs) may provide additional explanatory insights. In a unique cohort of European and South Asian men, we compared cross-sectional associations between AAs, metabolic and obesity traits, and longitudinal associations with incident diabetes. Methods: Nuclear magnetic spectroscopy was used to measure the baseline (1988\u20131991) levels of nine AAs in serum samples from a British population-based cohort of 1,279 European and 1,007 South Asian non-diabetic men aged 40\u201369 years. Follow-up was complete for 19 years in 801 European and 643 South Asian participants. Results: The serum concentrations of isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and alanine were significantly higher in South Asian men, while cross-sectional correlations of AAs with glycaemia and insulin resistance were similar in the two ethnic groups. However, most AAs were less strongly correlated with measures of obesity in the South Asian participants. Diabetes developed in 227 (35%) South Asian and 113 (14%) European men. Stronger adverse associations were observed between branched chain and aromatic AAs and incident diabetes in South Asian men. Tyrosine was a particularly strong predictor of incident diabetes in South Asian individuals, even after adjustment for metabolic risk factors, including obesity and insulin resistance (adjusted OR for a 1 SD increment, 1.47, 95% CI 1.17,1.85, p = 0.001) compared with Europeans (OR 1.10, 0.87, 1.39, p = 0.4; p = 0.045 for ethnicity \u00d7 tyrosine interaction). Conclusions/interpretation: Branched chain and aromatic AAs, particularly tyrosine, may be a focus for identifying novel aetiological mechanisms and potential treatment targets for diabetes in South Asian populations and may contribute to their excess risk of diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amino acids", "Cohort", "Diabetes", "Ethnicity", "European", "South Asian"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Amino Acids", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Blood Glucose", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Humans", "Incidence", "Insulin Resistance", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939943688", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57205524308": {"Name": "Eastwood S.V.", "AuthorID": "57205524308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57184675200": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "57184675200", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "NMR Metabolomics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "54879856600": {"Name": "W\u00fcrtz P.", "AuthorID": "54879856600", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "NMR Metabolomics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7003418142": {"Name": "Ala-Korpela M.", "AuthorID": "7003418142", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Computational Medicine, School of Social and Community Medicine and the Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60162089", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow School of Medicine"}, "6603478414": {"Name": "Forouhi N.G.", "AuthorID": "6603478414", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Institute of Metabolic Science"}, "7006405481": {"Name": "Godsland I.F.", "AuthorID": "7006405481", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology and Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7005585588": {"Name": "McKeigue P.M.", "AuthorID": "7005585588", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
