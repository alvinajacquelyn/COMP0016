Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are particularly delicate under that perspective since they involve real-time constraints and physical phenomena that are not usually considered in common IT solutions. Therefore, there is a need for publicly available monitoring tools able to contemplate these aspects. In this poster/demo, we present our initiative, called CPS-MT, towards a versatile, real-time CPS monitoring tool, with a particular focus on security research. We first present its architecture and main components, followed by a MiniCPS-based case study. We also describe a performance analysis and preliminary results. During the demo, we will discuss CPS-MT's capabilities and limitations for security applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CPS simulations", "Cyber physical systems", "Cybersecurity", "Industrial control systems", "Real time monitoring", "Security research"], "IndexKeywords": ["CPS simulations", "Cyber security", "Industrial control systems", "Real time monitoring", "Security research"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061842297", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"42661001800": {"Name": "Barr\u00e8re M.", "AuthorID": "42661001800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57203458571": {"Name": "Hankin C.", "AuthorID": "57203458571", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57204123703": {"Name": "Barboni A.", "AuthorID": "57204123703", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57206660640": {"Name": "Zizzo G.", "AuthorID": "57206660640", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "8724118800": {"Name": "Maffeis S.", "AuthorID": "8724118800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "54411982800": {"Name": "Boem F.", "AuthorID": "54411982800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
