Children are born with hearing loss and develop sight loss in their early years of life. It is estimated to affect between 3 and 6 people in every 100,000. A barrier to the involvement and participation of deafblind people in research is access to information in appropriate formats. Individuals have varying degrees of sight and hearing impairment meaning there is not a singular solution to supporting all people\u2019s communication needs. There is evidence that severe sight and hearing impairments are used as exclusion criteria in some research studies. This exclusion may extend into involvement activities. Methods Eight people, including five people with Usher syndrome, attended a research discussion group. Through this activity, we identified what to consider when looking to improve the experience of taking part in a discussion about research for deafblind individuals. Results Among contributors two people made use of standard British Sign Language interpretation and one communicated using hands-on signing. Contributors highlighted the limitations associated with signing and lip reading such as exhaustion and clear lines of sight as well as the need for additional formats such as speech to text reporting, and high contrast (e.g. black text with a yellow background) printouts with large (18 point and above), sans-serif fonts (e.g. Arial). A large proportion of discussions were on the importance of wrap around emotional support for people who are deafblind and their family throughout the research pathway. This includes counselling, peer support and sensitive and mindful facilitators of involvement activities. Conclusions The range and specific nature of the communication methods and support offerings that deafblind people depend on are broad and require researchers and involvement practitioners to reach out to deafblind contributors earlier on, in order to appropriately tailor approaches and put the most suitable support in place. Informed by this discussion group, we have developed a checklist of key considerations to support the inclusion of deafblind individuals in research conversations, supplemented with input from the sensory disability charity Sense.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accessibility", "Communication", "Deafblind", "Deafblindness", "Hearing impairment", "Involvement", "Participation", "Research", "Sight impairment", "Usher syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067292048", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"]], "AuthorData": {"57209304410": {"Name": "Skilton A.", "AuthorID": "57209304410", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506942455": {"Name": "Moosajee M.", "AuthorID": "6506942455", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209310006": {"Name": "Francome-Wood P.", "AuthorID": "57209310006", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209304876": {"Name": "Boswell E.", "AuthorID": "57209304876", "AffiliationID": "118217686", "AffiliationName": "Sense"}, "57209308737": {"Name": "Prince K.", "AuthorID": "57209308737", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "Research Community Contributor, NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
