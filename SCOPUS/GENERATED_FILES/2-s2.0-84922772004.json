We present Taggling a location based game designed to support learning in the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art. The results of a qualitative user study with volunteers helped us to outline the learning potential of the game and supported us to gain an insight on the integration of the game in the educational activities of the museum. Furthermore, our data analysis showed that the game experience revolves around revisiting the same artwork and viewing it with the help of curatorial information constructed in the form of tags, casting visitors in an active role and helping them to engage with the exhibits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["artwork", "curatorial information", "establishing contact", "game based learning", "location based games"], "IndexKeywords": ["artwork", "curatorial information", "Educational activities", "Game experience", "Game-based Learning", "Learning potential", "Location based games", "Support learning"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922772004", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"43461953000": {"Name": "Yiannoutsou N.", "AuthorID": "43461953000", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Patras"}, "56516934500": {"Name": "Manoli V.", "AuthorID": "56516934500", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Patras"}, "53881201300": {"Name": "Dimaraki E.", "AuthorID": "53881201300", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Patras"}, "6603741790": {"Name": "Avouris N.", "AuthorID": "6603741790", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Patras"}, "6507200821": {"Name": "Sintoris C.", "AuthorID": "6507200821", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Patras"}, "56516931300": {"Name": "Anastasaki S.", "AuthorID": "56516931300", "AffiliationID": "123332160", "AffiliationName": "Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art"}, "56516839600": {"Name": "Mavini C.", "AuthorID": "56516839600", "AffiliationID": "123332160", "AffiliationName": "Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art"}}}
