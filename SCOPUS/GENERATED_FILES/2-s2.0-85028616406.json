Studies highlight the relevance of IU for Eating Disorders (EDs) however, potential factors contributing to IU in EDs remain unstudied. Methods: Three hundred and forty-nine women with ED symptoms and 214 individuals without ED symptoms were recruited and compared on levels of IU, insecure (anxious and avoidant) attachment styles, extraversion and openness. Secondly, the contribution of these factors to IU were tested. Results: Compared to the non-ED group, the ED group scored higher on IU, insecure attachment, and lower on extraversion and openness. Regression analyses confirmed that higher insecure attachment, and lower extraversion predicted higher IU scores in the ED group, and that insecure attachment predicted higher IU scores in the non-ED group. Conclusions: Results confirm the relevance of IU to ED, and demonstrate that personality traits and insecure attachment styles contribute to IU in ED. Findings add to the growing literature on IU in ED and suggest that people with EDs may benefit from clinical interventions targeting IU.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eating disorders", "Extraversion", "Insecure attachment", "Intolerance of uncertainty", "Openness to experience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028616406", "SubjectAreas": [["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"36703114100": {"Name": "Sternheim L.", "AuthorID": "36703114100", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University, Social, Health and Organisation Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences"}, "57199375716": {"Name": "Fisher M.", "AuthorID": "57199375716", "AffiliationID": "60105147", "AffiliationName": "Regent's University London, School of Psychotherapy and Psychology"}, "35179313900": {"Name": "Harrison A.", "AuthorID": "35179313900", "AffiliationID": "112932431", "AffiliationName": "Ellern Mede Service for Eating Disorders"}, "15123426400": {"Name": "Watling R.", "AuthorID": "15123426400", "AffiliationID": "60105147", "AffiliationName": "Regent's University London, School of Psychotherapy and Psychology"}}}
