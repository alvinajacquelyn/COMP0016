All rights reserved.Humans display anticipatory motor responses to minimize the adverse effects of predictable perturbations.Awidely accepted explanation for this behaviour relies on the notion of an inverse model that, learning frommotor errors, anticipates corrective responses. Here, we propose and validate the alternative hypothesis that anticipatory control can be realized through a cascade of purely sensory predictions that drive the motor system, reflecting the causal sequence of the perceptual events preceding the error. We compare both hypotheses in a simulated anticipatory postural adjustment task. We observe that adaptation in the sensory domain, but not in the motor one, supports the robust and generalizable anticipatory control characteristic of biological systems. Our proposal unites the neurobiology of the cerebellum with the theory of active inference and provides a concrete implementation of its core tenets with great relevance both to our understanding of biological control systems and, possibly, to their emulation in complex artefacts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active inference", "Cerebellum", "Computational model", "Motor control", "Perceptual learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Humans", "Models, Psychological", "Movement", "Posture"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038879589", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55803629300": {"Name": "Maffei G.", "AuthorID": "55803629300", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)"}, "7006315557": {"Name": "Verschure P.", "AuthorID": "7006315557", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA)"}, "48061181800": {"Name": "Herreros I.", "AuthorID": "48061181800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Neuroscience and Theoretical Neurobiology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College of London (UCL)"}, "35303516200": {"Name": "Sanchez-Fibla M.", "AuthorID": "35303516200", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Neuroscience and Theoretical Neurobiology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College of London (UCL)"}}}
