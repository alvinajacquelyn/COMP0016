Based on the analysis, it is found that increasing the line-of-sight component can enhance the estimation accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Correlated Rician fading channels", "Estimation techniques", "Line-of-sight components", "Linear minimum mean square errors", "Multi-user", "Multiple input multiple output system", "Performance analysis", "Rician fading"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946019638", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56941003500": {"Name": "Al-Salihi H.", "AuthorID": "56941003500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London"}, "7003948057": {"Name": "Said F.", "AuthorID": "7003948057", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London"}, "6603561059": {"Name": "Nallanathan A.", "AuthorID": "6603561059", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
