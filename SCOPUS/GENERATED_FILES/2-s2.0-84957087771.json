These were grown by drop-casting PCBM solutions onto the spectrosil substrates and by removing the residual solvent in a vacuum. A home-built atomic force microscope featuring a plane mirror differential optical interferometer, fiber-fed from a frequency-stabilized laser (emitting at 632.8 nm), was used to measure the crystals' height. The optical interferometer together with the stabilized laser provides traceability (via the laser wavelength) of the vertical measurements made with the atomic force microscope. We find that the crystals can conform to the surface topography, thanks to their height being significantly smaller compared to their lateral dimensions (namely, heights between about 50 nm and 140 nm, for the crystals analysed, vs. several tens of microns lateral dimensions). The vast majority of the crystals are flat, but an isolated, non-flat crystal provides insights into the growth mechanism and allows identification of \"molecular terraces\" whose height corresponds to one of the lattice constants of the single PCBM crystal (1.4 nm) as measured with X-ray diffraction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Frequency stabilized lasers", "Growth mechanisms", "Lateral dimension", "Molecular terraces", "Optical interferometer", "Residual solvents", "Stabilized lasers", "[6 ,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957087771", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35225091500": {"Name": "Lazzerini G.M.", "AuthorID": "35225091500", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "6602145380": {"Name": "Yacoot A.", "AuthorID": "6602145380", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "55914397200": {"Name": "Patern\u00f2 G.M.", "AuthorID": "55914397200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55562231300": {"Name": "Tregnago G.", "AuthorID": "55562231300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "11639461900": {"Name": "Treat N.", "AuthorID": "11639461900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science, Imperial College London"}, "24403087400": {"Name": "Stingelin N.", "AuthorID": "24403087400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science, Imperial College London"}}}
