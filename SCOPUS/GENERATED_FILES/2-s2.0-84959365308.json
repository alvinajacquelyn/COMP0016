The literature on the current portfolio of molecular diagnostics tests for TB is reviewed here and the developmental pipeline is summarized. Also reviewed are data from recently published operational research on the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and discussed are the lessons that can be taken forward for the design of studies to evaluate the impact of TB diagnostics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "FIND", "Molecular Diagnostics", "smear microscopy", "Tuberculosis", "WHO", "Xpert"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Papanicolaou Test", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Serologic Tests", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959365308", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"20336943700": {"Name": "Bates M.", "AuthorID": "20336943700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals"}}}
