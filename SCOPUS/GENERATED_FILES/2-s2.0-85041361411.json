Solving this problem requires having reliable data on the stability and kinetics of formation of this mineral. Toward this goal, the solubility of natural dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) has been measured from 50 to 253 \u00b0C in 0.1 mol/kg NaCl solutions using a hydrogen electrode concentration cell (HECC). The obtained apparent solubility products (Kapp-sp-dol), for the reaction: CaMg(CO3)2 = Ca2+ + Mg2+ + 2CO32\u2212, were extrapolated to infinite dilution to generate the solubility product constants for this reaction (Ksp\u00b0-dol). The derived equilibrium constants were fit and can be accurately described by log10 Ksp\u00b0-dol = a + b/T (K) + cT (K) where a = 17.502, b = \u22124220.119 and c = \u22120.0689. This equation and its first and second derivatives with respect to T were used together with corresponding aqueous species properties to calculate the revised standard state thermodynamic properties of dolomite at 25 \u00b0C and 1 bar, yielding a Gibbs energy of formation (\u0394fG298.15\u2218) equal to \u22122160.9 \u00b1 2 kJ/mol, (log10 Ksp\u00b0-dol = \u221217.19 \u00b1 0.3); an enthalpy of formation (\u0394fH298.15\u2218) of \u22122323.1 \u00b1 2 kJ/mol, an entropy (S298.15\u2218) of 156.9 \u00b1 2 J/mol/K and heat capacity (Cp298.15\u2218) of 154.2 \u00b1 2 J/mol/K (uncertainties are 3\u03c3). The dolomite solubility product derived in this study is nearly identical to that computed using SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992) at 200 \u00b0C, but about one order of magnitude higher at 50 and 25 \u00b0C, suggesting that dolomite may be somewhat less stable than previously assumed at ambient temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dolomite solubility product", "Stability", "Thermodynamic properties"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041361411", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"6603855013": {"Name": "B\u00e9n\u00e9zeth P.", "AuthorID": "6603855013", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, GET \u2013 CNRS \u2013 IRD \u2013 OMP \u2013 Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "56533858200": {"Name": "Berninger U.N.", "AuthorID": "56533858200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Dept. f\u00fcr Geo- und Umweltwissenschaften, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "7103177603": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177603", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, GET \u2013 CNRS \u2013 IRD \u2013 OMP \u2013 Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "57195018773": {"Name": "Oelkers E.H.", "AuthorID": "57195018773", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, GET \u2013 CNRS \u2013 IRD \u2013 OMP \u2013 Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "11839488000": {"Name": "Bovet N.", "AuthorID": "11839488000", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Nano-Science Center, University of Copenhagen"}}}
