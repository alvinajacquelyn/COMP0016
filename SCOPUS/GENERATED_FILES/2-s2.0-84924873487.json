Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare condition attributed to cilia dysfunction. Murine models of BBS suggest a respiratory phenotype; however, no reports have studied the translation of these findings in patients. METHODS: We assessed the clinical symptoms of motile cilia dysfunction and the histology of ciliated respiratory epithelium in patients with BBS. RESULTS: We report an increased prevalence of neonatal respiratory distress at birth (12%), general practitioner-diagnosed asthma (21%), otitis media (33%), and rhinitis (36%) in patients with BBS. These symptoms, however, occurred at a significantly reduced prevalence compared with patients with known motile cilia dysfunction (primary ciliary dyskinesia). Respiratory epithelial assessment revealed cellular damage, significant ciliary depletion (on 60% of ciliated cells), and goblet cell hyperplasia in patients with BBS (50% goblet cells). These findings were quantifiably similar to those of patients with asthma (P > .05). Surprisingly, motile cilia function and ultrastructure were grossly normal with the exception of occasional unique inclusions within the ciliary membrane. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, motile ciliary structure and function are essentially normal in patients with BBS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Asthma", "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cilia", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Kartagener Syndrome", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Otitis Media", "Phenotype", "Prevalence", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Retrospective Studies", "Rhinitis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924873487", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"16246385000": {"Name": "Shoemark A.", "AuthorID": "16246385000", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"}, "26326721400": {"Name": "Dixon M.", "AuthorID": "26326721400", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "PCD Diagnostic Team, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust"}, "17834731500": {"Name": "Hogg C.L.", "AuthorID": "17834731500", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "PCD Diagnostic Team, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust"}, "7004556611": {"Name": "Beales P.L.", "AuthorID": "7004556611", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
