Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced metabolic abnormalities and antiretroviral therapy (ART), genetic factors, most importantly the rs738409 C > G p.I148M variant in the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3)-gene, as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection may all cause hepatic steatosis (HS). However, recent studies suggest a protective effect of HCV infection on HS. Thus, we evaluated HS prior and after HCV eradication in an HIV/HCV-coinfected cohort at the Medical University of Vienna between January 2014 and June 2017. Two hundred forty-seven patients underwent liver stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)-based steatosis assessment. A subcohort of 138 patients also had follow-up CAP measurement after HCV eradication by direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). A CAP value \u2265248 dB/m defined HS and all CAP values were adapted to compensate for body mass index (BMI) and diabetes mellitus. Among all 247 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, HS was prevalent in 31%, mean age was 43.3 years, 75% were male, the main ethnicity was Caucasian (96%), and mean BMI was 23.33 kg/m 2 . Independent risk factors for HS were BMI, years exposed to HIV, PNPLA3 G-alleles, and protease inhibitor (PI) intake. Notably, a significant increase in CAP (from 225 \u00b1 52.9 to 235 \u00b1 50.7 dB/m; p = 0.047) was observed after HCV eradication, whereas patients on PI-containing ART experienced a significant decrease in CAP. Overall, one-third of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are affected by HS with PI-based ART and PNPLA3 impacting on HS prevalence. While HCV eradication by DAAs increased HS, as assessed by CAP, future studies should account for metabolic syndrome and evaluate whether changes in CAP-based steatosis assessments correspond to a clinically relevant outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["controlled attenuation parameter", "hepatic steatosis", "hepatitis C virus", "HIV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiviral Agents", "Austria", "Cohort Studies", "Coinfection", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065549897", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57057695400": {"Name": "Chromy D.", "AuthorID": "57057695400", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "56176028800": {"Name": "Bucsics T.", "AuthorID": "56176028800", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "57220552498": {"Name": "Bauer D.", "AuthorID": "57220552498", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "55803009600": {"Name": "Scheiner B.", "AuthorID": "55803009600", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "57207728458": {"Name": "Schmidbauer C.", "AuthorID": "57207728458", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "7101836598": {"Name": "Ferenci P.", "AuthorID": "7101836598", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "113754013", "AffiliationName": "Vienna HIV and Liver Study Group"}, "56149239100": {"Name": "Lang G.F.", "AuthorID": "56149239100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004356027": {"Name": "Szekeres T.", "AuthorID": "7004356027", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
