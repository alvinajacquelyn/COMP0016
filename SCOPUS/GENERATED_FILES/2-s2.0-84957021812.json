In particular new limits on available selectivity using band pass filters are introduced and discussed. Existing work has focussed primarily on electrically evoked compound action potentials (CAPs) where only a single evoked response per velocity is recorded. This paper extends the theory of VSR to naturally occurring neural signals recorded from rat and describes a practical method to estimate the level of activity (firing rates) within particular velocity ranges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electroneurogram", "Multielectrode cuff", "Velocity Selective Recording"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electroneurogram", "Evoked compound action potential", "Evoked response", "Multi-electrode cuffs", "Naturally occurring", "Practical method", "Velocity range", "Velocity selective recordings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957021812", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7405402409": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7405402409", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "56647873300": {"Name": "Metcalfe B.", "AuthorID": "56647873300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "24801876400": {"Name": "Clarke C.", "AuthorID": "24801876400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "23491645500": {"Name": "Chew D.", "AuthorID": "23491645500", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair, University of Cambridge"}, "37049240100": {"Name": "Nielsen T.", "AuthorID": "37049240100", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University"}, "15723130500": {"Name": "Donaldson N.", "AuthorID": "15723130500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}}}
