Prototype foamy virus (PFV) vectors have been described for gene therapy, although their use has mainly been restricted to ex vivo stem cell modification. Here we report direct in vivo transgene delivery with PFV vectors carrying reporter gene constructs. In our investigations, systemic PFV vector delivery to neonatal mice gave transgene expression in the heart, xiphisternum, liver, pancreas, and gut, whereas intracranial administration produced brain expression until animals were euthanized 49 days post-transduction. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy analysis of injected brains showed that transgene expression was highly localized to hippocampal architecture despite vector delivery being administered to the lateral ventricle. This was compared with intracranial biodistribution of lentiviral vectors and adeno-associated virus vectors, which gave a broad, non-specific spread through the neonatal mouse brain without regional localization, even when administered at lower copy numbers. Our work demonstrates that PFV can be used for neonatal gene delivery with an intracranial expression profile that localizes to hippocampal neurons, potentially because of the mitotic status of the targeted cells, which could be of use for research applications and gene therapy of neurological disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioimaging", "foamy virus", "gene therapy", "hippocampus", "spumavirus", "vector tropism", "viral vector"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050862188", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57076197200": {"Name": "Counsell J.R.", "AuthorID": "57076197200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56589998400": {"Name": "Karda R.", "AuthorID": "56589998400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57201602353": {"Name": "Diaz J.A.", "AuthorID": "57201602353", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57203190946": {"Name": "Carey L.", "AuthorID": "57203190946", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7101614142": {"Name": "Buckley S.M.K.", "AuthorID": "7101614142", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57203188340": {"Name": "Ameri S.", "AuthorID": "57203188340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "12796136100": {"Name": "Ng J.", "AuthorID": "12796136100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "26430341400": {"Name": "Baruteau J.", "AuthorID": "26430341400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003698645": {"Name": "Waddington S.N.", "AuthorID": "7003698645", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Wits/SAMRC Antiviral Gene Therapy Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "7007163773": {"Name": "Howe S.J.", "AuthorID": "7007163773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "14045774100": {"Name": "Rahim A.A.", "AuthorID": "14045774100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8382483900": {"Name": "Wiktorowicz T.", "AuthorID": "8382483900", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Institut f\u00fcr Virologie und Immunbiologie"}, "7003463863": {"Name": "Lindemann D.", "AuthorID": "7003463863", "AffiliationID": "60102531, 60018353", "AffiliationName": "Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "7006215853": {"Name": "Rethwilm A.", "AuthorID": "7006215853", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Institut f\u00fcr Virologie und Immunbiologie"}, "57203178909": {"Name": "Almeida F.", "AuthorID": "57203178909", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute and Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57193558964": {"Name": "de Silva R.", "AuthorID": "57193558964", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute and Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "16319693500": {"Name": "Simone R.", "AuthorID": "16319693500", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute and Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55831141300": {"Name": "Lugar\u00e0 E.", "AuthorID": "55831141300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Queen Square House, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54401141400": {"Name": "Lignani G.", "AuthorID": "54401141400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Queen Square House, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
