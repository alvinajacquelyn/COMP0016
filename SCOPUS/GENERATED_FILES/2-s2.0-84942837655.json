The translation of this technique to the clinical environment, however, requires robust and systematic optimization of the acoustic parameters needed to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. Currently, a variety of different devices have been developed to transfect cells in vitro, resulting in a lack of standardized experimental conditions and difficulty in comparing results from different laboratories. To overcome this limitation, we propose an easy-to-fabricate and cost-effective device for application in US-mediated delivery of therapeutic compounds. It comprises a commercially available cell culture dish coupled with a silicon-based ''lid'' developed in-house that enables the device to be immersed in a water bath for US exposure. Described here are the design of the device, characterization of the sound field and fluid dynamics inside the chamber and an example protocol for a therapeutic delivery experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell culture device", "In vitro assay", "Small interfering RNA", "Sonoporation", "Ultrasound-mediated drug delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical environments", "Experimental conditions", "In-vitro assays", "Small interfering RNA", "Sonoporation", "Systematic optimization", "Therapeutic compounds", "Therapeutic delivery", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Computer-Aided Design", "Dimethylpolysiloxanes", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Electroporation", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "High-Energy Shock Waves", "Materials Testing", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiometry", "Sonication", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942837655", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"55534774600": {"Name": "Carugo D.", "AuthorID": "55534774600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "55229762500": {"Name": "Owen J.", "AuthorID": "55229762500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "55764865400": {"Name": "Crake C.", "AuthorID": "55764865400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "56452559500": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "56452559500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "8782679600": {"Name": "Stride E.", "AuthorID": "8782679600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}}}
