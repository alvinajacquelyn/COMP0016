Research in this area has often used energetic maskers, which have their effects primarily at the auditory periphery. However, masking interference can also occur at more central auditory levels, known as informational masking. This experiment extends existing research by using multiple maskers that vary in their informational content and similarity to speech, in order to examine differences in perception of masked speech between trained musicians (n = 25) and non-musicians (n = 25). Although musicians outperformed non-musicians on a measure of frequency discrimination, they showed no advantage in perceiving masked speech. Further analysis revealed that non-verbal IQ, rather than musicianship, significantly predicted speech reception thresholds in noise. The results strongly suggest that the contribution of general cognitive abilities needs to be taken into account in any investigations of individual variability for perceiving speech in noise.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Background noise", "Cognitive ability", "Frequency discrimination", "Individual variability", "Informational masking", "Speech in noise", "Speech reception threshold", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Threshold", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Male", "Music", "Noise", "Occupations", "Perceptual Masking", "Pitch Discrimination", "Psychoacoustics", "Psychomotor Performance", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Speech Intelligibility", "Speech Perception", "Stroop Test", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Perception", "Wechsler Scales", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923833133", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"56451128000": {"Name": "Boebinger D.", "AuthorID": "56451128000", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "37025787600": {"Name": "Evans S.", "AuthorID": "37025787600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7401609413": {"Name": "Rosen S.", "AuthorID": "7401609413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "35932464400": {"Name": "Lima C.", "AuthorID": "35932464400", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychology, University of Porto"}, "6603781836": {"Name": "Manly T.", "AuthorID": "6603781836", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge"}, "7401505962": {"Name": "Scott S.", "AuthorID": "7401505962", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
