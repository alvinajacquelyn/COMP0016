In the classic OA paradigm, the decrease in stimulus intensity is preceded by an increase of equal size from an initial noxious level. Although the majority of researchers believe this temporal sequence of two changes is important for eliciting OA, it has also been suggested that the temporal contrast mechanism underlying OA may enhance detection of simple, isolated decreases in noxious heat. To test whether decreases in noxious heat intensity, by themselves, are perceived better than increases of comparable sizes, we used an adaptive two-interval alternative forced choice task to find perceptual thresholds for increases and decreases in radiant and contact heat. Decreases in noxious heat were more difficult to perceive than increases of comparable sizes from the same initial temperature of 45\u00b0C. In contrast, decreases and increases were perceived equally well within a common range of noxious temperatures (i.e., when increases started from 45\u00b0C and decreases started from 47\u00b0C). In another task, participants rated the pain intensity of heat stimuli that randomly and unpredictably increased, decreased, or remained constant. Ratings of unpredictable stimulus decreases also showed no evidence of perceptual enhancement. Our results demonstrate that there is no temporal contrast enhancement of simple, isolated decreases in noxious heat intensity. Combined with previous OA findings, they suggest that long-lasting noxious stimuli that follow an increase-decrease pattern may be important for eliciting the OA effect. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous research suggested that a small decrease in noxious heat intensity feels surprisingly large because of sensory enhancement of noxious stimulus offsets (a simplified form of \u201coffset analgesia\u201d). Using a two-alternative forced choice task where participants detected simple increases or decreases in noxious heat, we showed that decreases in noxious heat, by themselves, are no better perceived than increases of comparable sizes. This suggests that a decrease alone is not sufficient to elicit offset analgesia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nociception", "Offset analgesia", "Pain", "Psychophysics", "Signal detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Hot Temperature", "Humans", "Male", "Nociception", "Pain Perception", "Reaction Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065467178", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"56008169700": {"Name": "Beck B.", "AuthorID": "56008169700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57208674832": {"Name": "Gnanasampanthan S.", "AuthorID": "57208674832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University College London"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.D.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
