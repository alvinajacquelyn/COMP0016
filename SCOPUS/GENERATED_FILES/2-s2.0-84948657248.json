The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements of their atmospheric properties that constrain the planets' origins and evolution. For example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O > 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than is commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we report a precise near-infrared transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based on six transit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3. We bin the data in 13 spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 to 1.67 \u03bcm and measure the transit depths to a median precision of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties using the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption (7\u03c3 confidence). This detection marks the first high-confidence, spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. The retrieved 1 \u03c3 water volume mixing ratio is between 10-5 and 10-2, which is consistent with C/O > 1 to within 2\u03c3. However, we also introduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for C/O and metallicity under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. With this approach, we constrain C/O to at 1\u03c3 and rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere composition (C/O > 1) at >3\u03c3 confidence. Further observations and modeling of the planet's global thermal structure and dynamics would aid in resolving the tension between our inferred C/O and previous constraints. Our findings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data with multiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on the chemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["planets and satellites: atmospheres", "planets and satellites: composition", "planets and satellites: individual (WASP-12b)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948657248", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"53984204700": {"Name": "Kreidberg L.", "AuthorID": "53984204700", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Chicago"}, "7102286699": {"Name": "Bean J.", "AuthorID": "7102286699", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Chicago"}, "35270219700": {"Name": "Stevenson K.", "AuthorID": "35270219700", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Chicago"}, "15725353500": {"Name": "Line M.", "AuthorID": "15725353500", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California"}, "57203103268": {"Name": "Fortney J.", "AuthorID": "57203103268", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California"}, "6701916635": {"Name": "D\u00e9sert J.", "AuthorID": "6701916635", "AffiliationID": "60000221, 60093072", "AffiliationName": "CASA, Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences, University of Colorado, 389-UCB"}, "15124325100": {"Name": "Madhusudhan N.", "AuthorID": "15124325100", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55660948300": {"Name": "Barstow J.", "AuthorID": "55660948300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "7202189875": {"Name": "Henry G.", "AuthorID": "7202189875", "AffiliationID": "60007488", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Information Systems, Tennessee State University"}, "15078583900": {"Name": "Williamson M.", "AuthorID": "15078583900", "AffiliationID": "60007488", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Information Systems, Tennessee State University"}, "6603060770": {"Name": "Showman A.", "AuthorID": "6603060770", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Planetary Sciences and Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona"}}}
