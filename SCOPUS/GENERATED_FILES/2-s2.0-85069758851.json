Sub-Saharan African urban areas show evidence of both negative and positive selection on health status at outmigration. Health outcomes as measured in urban populations may not reflect local health risks and access to health services. Methods Using the Ouagadougou Health and Demographic Surveillance System and a migrant follow-up survey, we measured differences in health between matched non-migrants and outmigrants. We applied Cox and competing risks models on migration and death. Results Controlling for premigration health status, migrants who moved out of Ouagadougou have higher mortality (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.23 to 8.58) than non-migrants and migrants moving to other Ouagadougou areas. However, these effects vanish in the matched sample controlling for all interactions between death determinants. These and other results show little evidence that migration led to higher mortality or worse health. Conclusions Health outcomes as measured in Ouagadougou population do reflect local health risks and access to health services despite high migration intensity. However, neither the hypothesis of effect of health on migration nor the hypothesis of negative effect of migration on health or survival was confirmed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demography", "public health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Burkina Faso", "Cohort Studies", "Emigration and Immigration", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Assessment", "Urban Health", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069758851", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55899105900": {"Name": "Bocquier P.", "AuthorID": "55899105900", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "36678200200": {"Name": "Soura A.B.", "AuthorID": "36678200200", "AffiliationID": "60072104", "AffiliationName": "Institut Sup\u00e9rieur des Sciences de la Population, Universit\u00e9 de Ouagadougou"}, "57208934554": {"Name": "Sanogo S.", "AuthorID": "57208934554", "AffiliationID": "60072104", "AffiliationName": "Institut Sup\u00e9rieur des Sciences de la Population, Universit\u00e9 de Ouagadougou"}, "7004464347": {"Name": "Randall S.", "AuthorID": "7004464347", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College of London"}}}
