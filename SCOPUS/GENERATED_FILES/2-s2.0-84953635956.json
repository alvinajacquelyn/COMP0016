The LCS formulation presented here consists of a discrete time linear system and a set of complementarity conditions. The discrete time linear system corresponds to the flow conservation equations while the complementarity conditions govern the sending and receiving functions defined by a series of \u2018min\u2019 operations in the MCTM. Technical difficulties encountered in application of the CTM and its extensions such as the hard nonlinearity caused by the \u2018min\u2019 operator can be avoided by the proposed LCS model. Several basic properties of the proposed LCS formulation, for example, existence and uniqueness of solution, are analysed based on the theory of linear complementarity problem. By this formulation, the theory of LCS developed in control and mathematical programming communities can be applied to the qualitative analysis of the CTM/MCTM. It is shown that the CTM/MCTM is equivalent to a convex programme which can be converted into a constrained linear quadratic control problem. It is found that these results are irrelevant to the cell partition, that is, different cell partitions will not change the uniqueness and convexity of solution. This property is essential for stability analysis and control synthesis. The proposed LCS formulation makes the CTM/MCTM convenient for the design of traffic state estimators, ramp metering controllers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["complementarity condition", "convexity", "linear complementaritysystem", "the cell transmission model (CTM)", "uniqueness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell transmission model", "complementarity condition", "convexity", "linear complementaritysystem", "uniqueness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953635956", "SubjectAreas": [["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"36599474200": {"Name": "Zhong R.", "AuthorID": "36599474200", "AffiliationID": "112981364", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Transportation Systems"}, "55556202000": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "55556202000", "AffiliationID": "112981364", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Transportation Systems"}, "56035922800": {"Name": "Yuan F.", "AuthorID": "56035922800", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automatic Control, Sun Yat-Sen University"}, "56991607200": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "56991607200", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automatic Control, Sun Yat-Sen University"}, "55569891100": {"Name": "Pan T.", "AuthorID": "55569891100", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}, "36146863600": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "36146863600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
