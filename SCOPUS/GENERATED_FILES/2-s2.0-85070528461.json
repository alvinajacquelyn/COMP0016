We investigated clinically-defined 14-day treatment failure, and recurrence and S. aureus-attributed/unattributed mortality by 12-weeks to further define their predictors. Methods: A post-hoc exploratory analysis using competing risks models was conducted to identify sub-groups which might benefit from rifampicin. A points-based recurrence risk score was developed and used to compare rifampicin's benefits. Results: Recurrence was strongly associated with liver and renal failure, diabetes and immune-suppressive drugs (p < 0.005); in contrast, failure and S. aureus-attributed mortality were associated with older age and higher neutrophil counts. Higher SOFA scores predicted mortality; higher Charlson scores and deep-seated initial infection focus predicted failure. Unexpectedly, recurrence risk increased with increasing BMI in placebo (p = 0.04) but not rifampicin (p = 0.60) participants (pheterogeneity = 0.06). A persistent focus was judged the primary reason for recurrence in 23(74%). A 5-factor risk score based on BMI, Immunosuppression, Renal disease, Diabetes, Liver disease (BIRDL) strongly predicted recurrence (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Rifampicin reduces recurrences overall; those with greatest absolute risk reductions were identified using a simple risk score. Source control and adequate duration of antibiotic therapy remain essential to prevent recurrence and improve outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteraemia", "Mortality", "Recurrence", "Rifampicin", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteremia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Recurrence", "Rifampin", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Treatment Failure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070528461", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57192416714": {"Name": "Szubert A.", "AuthorID": "57192416714", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, University College London"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "36727094700": {"Name": "Bailey S.L.", "AuthorID": "36727094700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}, "6601958554": {"Name": "Edgeworth J.D.", "AuthorID": "6601958554", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}, "57199371710": {"Name": "Cooke G.S.", "AuthorID": "57199371710", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "7005772816": {"Name": "Peto T.", "AuthorID": "7005772816", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6603796838": {"Name": "Thwaites G.E.", "AuthorID": "6603796838", "AffiliationID": "60138292", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Clinical Research Unit"}, "57201536091": {"Name": "Llewelyn M.J.", "AuthorID": "57201536091", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}}}
