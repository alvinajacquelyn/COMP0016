The Journal of Physiology \u00a9 2017 The Physiological SocietyKey points: Wave travel plays an important role in cardiovascular physiology. However, many aspects of pulmonary arterial wave behaviour remain unclear. Wave intensity and reservoir-excess pressure analyses were applied in the pulmonary artery in subjects with and without pulmonary hypertension during spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests. Arterial wave energy decreased during expiration and Valsalva manoeuvre due to decreased ventricular preload. Wave energy also decreased during handgrip exercise due to increased heart rate. In pulmonary hypertension patients, the asymptotic pressure at which the microvascular flow ceases, the reservoir pressure related to arterial compliance and the excess pressure caused by waves increased. The reservoir and excess pressures decreased during Valsalva manoeuvre but remained unchanged during handgrip exercise. This study provides insights into the influence of pulmonary vascular disease, spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests on pulmonary artery wave propagation and reservoir function. Abstract: Detailed haemodynamic analysis may provide novel insights into the pulmonary circulation. Therefore, wave intensity and reservoir-excess pressure analyses were applied in the pulmonary artery to characterize changes in wave propagation and reservoir function during spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests. Right heart catheterization was performed using a pressure and Doppler flow sensor tipped guidewire to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the pulmonary artery in control subjects and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at rest. In controls, recordings were also obtained during Valsalva manoeuvre and handgrip exercise. The asymptotic pressure at which the flow through the microcirculation ceases, the reservoir pressure related to arterial compliance and the excess pressure caused by arterial waves increased in PAH patients compared to controls. The systolic and diastolic rate constants also increased, while the diastolic time constant decreased. The forward compression wave energy decreased by \u223c8% in controls and \u223c6% in PAH patients during expiration compared to inspiration, while the wave speed remained unchanged throughout the respiratory cycle. Wave energy decreased during Valsalva manoeuvre (by \u223c45%) and handgrip exercise (by \u223c27%) with unaffected wave speed. Moreover, the reservoir and excess pressures decreased during Valsalva manoeuvre but remained unaltered during handgrip exercise. In conclusion, reservoir-excess pressure analysis applied to the pulmonary artery revealed distinctive differences between controls and PAH patients. Variations in the ventricular preload and afterload influence pulmonary arterial wave propagation as demonstrated by changes in wave energy during spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hemodynamics", "pulmonary circulation", "pulse wave analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Artery", "Respiration", "Valsalva Maneuver", "Vascular Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030028828", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"57191884407": {"Name": "Su J.", "AuthorID": "57191884407", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7003695764": {"Name": "Simonsen U.", "AuthorID": "7003695764", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "8056207000": {"Name": "Howard L.", "AuthorID": "8056207000", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7401598095": {"Name": "Parker K.", "AuthorID": "7401598095", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}}}
