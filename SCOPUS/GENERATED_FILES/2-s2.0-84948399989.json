The main objective is to identify the influence of the Reynolds number on oxy-fuel flame structure, and to clarify the differences of scalar structures between oxy-fuel syngas and syngas-air flames at a similar higher Reynolds number. Two oxy-syngas flames at Reynolds numbers of 3000 and 6000 and one syngas-air flame at Reynolds number of 6000 were simulated. These studies show that the existence of CO2 in the oxidant has a profound effect on scalar structure of oxy-fuel syngas flame compared to syngas-air flame.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Direct Numerical Simulatio", "FGM", "Non-premixed combustion", "Oxy-fuel syngas"], "IndexKeywords": ["Detailed chemistry", "Flame structure", "Non-premixed", "Non-premixed flame", "Nonpremixed combustion", "Numerical simulatio", "Syn-gas", "Syngas flames"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948399989", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8319438000": {"Name": "Dinesh K.", "AuthorID": "8319438000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}, "11338846500": {"Name": "Richardson E.", "AuthorID": "11338846500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}, "6602149948": {"Name": "Van Oijen J.", "AuthorID": "6602149948", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Combustion Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "36188106300": {"Name": "Jiang X.", "AuthorID": "36188106300", "AffiliationID": "60117770, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Department, Lancaster University"}}}
