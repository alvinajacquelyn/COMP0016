In gene mutation carriers without left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (G + LVH-), subclinical imaging biomarkers are recognized as predictors of overt HCM, consisting of anterior mitral valve leaflet elongation, myocardial crypts, hyperdynamic LV ejection fraction, and abnormal apical trabeculation. Reverse curvature of the interventricular septum (into the LV) is characteristic of overt HCM. We aimed to assess LV septal convexity in subclinical HCM. Methods: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed on 36 G + LVH- individuals (31 \u00b1 14 years, 33 % males) with a pathogenic sarcomere mutation, and 36 sex and age-matched healthy controls (33 \u00b1 12 years, 33 % males). Septal convexity (SCx) was measured in the apical four chamber view perpendicular to a reference line connecting the mid-septal wall at tricuspid valve insertion level and the apical right ventricular insertion point. Results: Septal convexity was increased in G + LVH- compared to controls (maximal distance of endocardium to reference line: 5.0 \u00b1 2.5 mm vs. 1.6 \u00b1 2.4 mm, p \u2264 0.0001). Expected findings occurred in G + LVH- individuals: longer anterior mitral valve leaflet (23.5 \u00b1 3.0 mm vs. 19.9 \u00b1 3.1 mm, p \u2264 0.0001), higher relative wall thickness (0.31 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.29 \u00b1 0.04, p \u2264 0.05), higher LV ejection fraction (70.8 \u00b1 4.3 % vs. 68.3 \u00b1 4.4 %, p \u2264 0.05), and smaller LV end-systolic volume index (21.4 \u00b1 4.4 ml/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 23.7 \u00b1 5.8 ml/m<sup>2</sup>, p \u2264 0.05). Other morphologic measurements (LV angles, sphericity index, and eccentricity index) were not different between G + LVH- and controls. Conclusions: Septal convexity is an additional previously undescribed feature of subclinical HCM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "Genetics", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Septal curvature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Asymptomatic Diseases", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Stroke Volume", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938235199", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6507624424": {"Name": "Reant P.", "AuthorID": "6507624424", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60003434, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Cardiologique du Haut-Lev\u00eaque (Pessac), CHU de Bordeaux, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "19337718800": {"Name": "Mirabel M.", "AuthorID": "19337718800", "AffiliationID": "60136279", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U970, Paris Cardiovascular Research Center PARCC"}, "32367730300": {"Name": "Nasis A.", "AuthorID": "32367730300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "57203175810": {"Name": "Sado D.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175810", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "55355501300": {"Name": "Maestrini V.", "AuthorID": "55355501300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "55318143300": {"Name": "Castelletti S.", "AuthorID": "55318143300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "26534328000": {"Name": "Herrey A.S.", "AuthorID": "26534328000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "8892126000": {"Name": "Syrris P.", "AuthorID": "8892126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "8786523100": {"Name": "Tome-Esteban M.", "AuthorID": "8786523100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "57217727705": {"Name": "Jenkins S.", "AuthorID": "57217727705", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "56672467900": {"Name": "McKenna W.J.", "AuthorID": "56672467900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit, Heart Hospital, University College London"}}}
