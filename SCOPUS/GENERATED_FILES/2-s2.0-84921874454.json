The experiments were carried out in a dedicated and controlled indoor atmospheric chamber. The turbulence environment was created by introducing hot air, while the temperature profile was monitored throughout the chamber to maintain a constant environment. By evaluating the error performance of different modulation schemes under identical conditions, it was observed that pulse position modulation offers the best performance, followed by subcarrier intensity modulation under weak turbulence environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bit error rate", "Free space optics", "modulation schemes", "turbulence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric chambers", "Controlled laboratories", "Free Space Optical communication", "Free space optics", "Identical conditions", "Modulation schemes", "Subcarrier intensity modulation", "Temperature profiles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921874454", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"24468848400": {"Name": "Rajbhandari S.", "AuthorID": "24468848400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "50261785000": {"Name": "Kanesan T.", "AuthorID": "50261785000", "AffiliationID": "60078090", "AffiliationName": "Telekom Research and Development, TM Innovation Centre"}, "35735086700": {"Name": "Tang X.", "AuthorID": "35735086700", "AffiliationID": "60002246", "AffiliationName": "Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
