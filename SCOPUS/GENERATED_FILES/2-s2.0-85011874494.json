Testifying to the importance of such social cues, parts of the neural system dedicated to the detection of physical pain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), have been shown to be equally sensitive to the detection of social pain experienced after social exclusion. However, recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index any socially pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the dACC-AI would respond to cues of both inclusion and exclusion, using a novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion. Our findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system restricted within the social domain to the processing of signals of exclusion require significant revision.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Pain", "Social Distance", "Social Environment", "Stress, Psychological", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011874494", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003768363": {"Name": "Dalgleish T.", "AuthorID": "7003768363", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "26635865900": {"Name": "Schweizer S.", "AuthorID": "26635865900", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "37073576600": {"Name": "Stretton J.", "AuthorID": "37073576600", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "8761819300": {"Name": "Walsh N.D.", "AuthorID": "8761819300", "AffiliationID": "60160138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "6701470126": {"Name": "Mobbs D.", "AuthorID": "6701470126", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "35747343700": {"Name": "Van Harmelen A.L.", "AuthorID": "35747343700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Psychiatry Section, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7003749366": {"Name": "Dunn V.", "AuthorID": "7003749366", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Psychiatry Section, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Psychiatry Section, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "10140233000": {"Name": "Dunn B.", "AuthorID": "10140233000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Washington Singer Laboratories, University of Exeter"}}}
