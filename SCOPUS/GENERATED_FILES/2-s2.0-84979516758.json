All rights reserved.This paper presents a tool for the configuration of logging and authoring of automated feedback for exploratory learning objects (ELOs). This tool has been developed in the context of a larger project that is developing a platform for authoring interactive educational e-books. This platform comprises an extendable set of diverse widgets that can be used to generate instances of exploratory activities that can be employed in various learning scenarios. AuthELO was designed and developed to provide a simple, common and efficient authoring interface that can normalise the heterogeneity of these widgets and give the ability to non-experts to easily modify - if not program themselves - the feedback that is provided to students based on their interaction. We describe the architecture and design characteristics of AuthELO and present a small-scale evaluation of the prototype that shows promising results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exploratory learning environments", "Feedback authoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automated feedback", "Design characteristics", "E-books", "Exploratory learning", "Feedback authoring", "Learning scenarios", "Small-scale evaluation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979516758", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56333544000": {"Name": "Karkalas S.", "AuthorID": "56333544000", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab., UCL Institute of Education"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab., UCL Institute of Education"}}}
