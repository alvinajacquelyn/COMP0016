In this study, comprehensive assessment of production, comprehension, and metalinguistic judgment of referring expressions revealed that children with SLI have weaknesses in both structural and pragmatic language skills relative to age-matched peers. Correlational analyses highlight a relationship between their performance on the experimental tasks and their structural language ability. Despite their poor performance on the production and comprehension tasks, children with SLI were able to recognize pragmatically under-informative reference relative to other types of utterance, although they imposed a less severe penalty on such expressions than typically developing peers, a pattern that supports the pragmatic tolerance account. Our novel methodology (which probed structural abilities from both the speaker's and hearer's perspectives as well as metalinguistic and pragmatic skills in the same sample) challenges the assumption that pragmatic errors stem from deficits in social cognition and instead supports recent findings suggesting that when the impact of structural language is isolated, pragmatic deficits may be resolved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Informativeness", "Pragmatics", "Reference", "Referring expressions", "Social cognition", "Specific language impairment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Comprehension", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Language Development Disorders", "Male", "Metacognition", "Social Communication Disorder"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950000050", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57085405200": {"Name": "Davies C.", "AuthorID": "57085405200", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Linguistics and Phonetics, University of Leeds"}, "55295862200": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9s-Roqueta C.", "AuthorID": "55295862200", "AffiliationID": "60002676", "AffiliationName": "Facultat de Ciencies Humanes i Socials, Universitat Jaume I de Castell\u00f3n"}, "7006372166": {"Name": "Norbury C.F.", "AuthorID": "7006372166", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}}}
