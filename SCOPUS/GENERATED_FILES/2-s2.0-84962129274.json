Our aims in this exploratory analysis were to study the association between PUA and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), blood pressure, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness in T1D adolescents. These associations were also studied in healthy control (HC) subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 188 T1D subjects recruited to the Adolescent Type 1 Diabetes Cardio- Renal Intervention Trial (AdDIT) and 65 HC subjects. Baseline PUA, eGFRcystatin C, ACR, blood pressure, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured. RESULTS PUA was lower in T1D vs. HC subjects (242 \u00b1 55 vs. 306 \u00b1 74 \u03bcmol/L, respectively; P < 0.0001). Higher PUA was inversely associated with eGFR in T1D subjects (r = 20.48, P < 0.0001) even after correction for baseline clinical demographic characteristics. PUA was not associated with ACR in T1D after adjustment for potential confounders such as eGFR. For cardiovascular parameters, PUA levels did not associate with systolic blood pressure, FMD, or PWVin T1D or HC subjects. CONCLUSIONS Even within the physiological range, PUA levels were significantly lower in T1D adolescent patients compared with HC subjects. Therewas an inverse relationship between PUA and eGFR in T1D, likely reflecting an increase in clearance. There were no associations observed with ACR, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, or endothelial function. Thus, in contrast with adults, PUA may not yet be associated with cardiorenal abnormalities in adolescents with T1D.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Blood Pressure",
