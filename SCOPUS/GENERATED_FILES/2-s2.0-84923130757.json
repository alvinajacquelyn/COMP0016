In developed countries, high rates of reversion following conversion have been described. Objectives: To assess QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT) conversion and reversion dynamics in a tuberculosis-endemic setting. Methods: Adolescents aged 12-18 years residing near Cape Town were recruited. Tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and QFTs were performed at baseline and after 2 years of follow up. Half of the participants had TST and QFT performed at additional time points. Participants were observed for incident tuberculosis disease for up to 5 years. Measurements and Main Results: Among 5,357 participants, 2,751 (51.4%) and 2,987 (55.8%) had positive QFT and TST results, respectively, at baseline. Annualized QFT and TST conversion risks were 14.0 and 13.0%, respectively, and reversion risks were 5.1 and 4.1%, respectively. Concordance was excellent for conversions (\u03ba = 0.74), but poor for reversions (\u03ba = 0.12). Among recent QFT converters, the magnitude of the QFT value was strongly inversely associatedwith risk of reversion(P < 0.0001).When longitudinal QFT data were analyzed in a cross-sectional manner, the annual risk of infection was 7.3%, whereas inclusion of reversions in the analysis showed that the actual risk of infection was 14.0%. Incident tuberculosis was 8-fold higher among QFT reverters than in participants with all negative QFT results (1.47 vs. 0.18 cases/100 person-years, P = 0.011). Conclusions: In this tuberculosis-endemic setting, annual risk of infection was extremely high, whereas QFT and TST conversion concordance was higher and QFT reversion rates were lower than reported in low-burden settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Epidemiology", "Interferon-\u03b3 release assays", "Tuberculin skin tests", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic", "South Africa", "Tuberculin Test", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923130757", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"15058787200": {"Name": "Andrews J.R.", "AuthorID": "15058787200", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "57204295879": {"Name": "Hatherill M.", "AuthorID": "57204295879", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "6603950018": {"Name": "Hanekom W.A.", "AuthorID": "6603950018", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "6506142685": {"Name": "Scriba T.J.", "AuthorID": "6506142685", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "12793019500": {"Name": "Mahomed H.", "AuthorID": "12793019500", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Community Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "8254491100": {"Name": "Campo M.", "AuthorID": "8254491100", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "6601968346": {"Name": "Hawn T.R.", "AuthorID": "6601968346", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "7404053384": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "7404053384", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60172628", "AffiliationName": "Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}}}
