Data from this site, a 'super' air quality monitoring station at Fudan University, has been used by researchers to investigate the formation mechanism of haze episodes. The characteristics and concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), n-alkanes, as well as relative abundances of hopanes, in these samples were determined. The concentrations showed a pronounced annual cycle with higher values in cold seasons (spring and winter, mean: 8.6 \u03bcg/m3, 3.3 \u03bcg/m3 and 136.4 ng/m3 for OC, EC and n-alkanes, respectively) and lower values in warm seasons (fall and summer, mean: 6.6 \u03bcg/m3, 2.6 \u03bcg/m3 and 73.8 ng/m3 for OC, EC and n-alkanes, respectively). EC generally displayed a common source with that of OC in all seasons. Petroleum residue was the major source of n-alkanes, contributing 71.4% to the targeted C14-C33 n-alkanes over four seasons. Principal components analysis and the composition of hopanes showed that emissions from vehicle exhaust contributed more carbonaceous aerosols than coal combustion. These data could provide important information for measures to reduce carbonaceous pollutant emissions and improve air quality in Shanghai, and other urban centers across China.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbonaceous pollutants", "PM2.5", "Seasonal variation", "Shanghai"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air quality monitoring stations", "Carbonaceous aerosol", "Carbonaceous pollutants", "Formation mechanism", "PM2.5", "Principal components analysis", "Seasonal variation", "Shanghai", "Aerosols", "Air Pollutants", "Alkanes", "Carbon", "China", "Coal", "Environmental Monitoring", "Particulate Matter", "Petroleum", "Seasons", "Urbanization", "Vehicle Emissions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958980483", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"56151870000": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "56151870000", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, College of Resources and Environmental Science, Chongqing University"}, "36514579800": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "36514579800", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention, Center for Atmospheric Chemistry Study, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University"}, "36562071600": {"Name": "Lin T.", "AuthorID": "36562071600", "AffiliationID": "60014466, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.L.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}}}
