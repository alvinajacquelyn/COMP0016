This information was updated every six months during a three-year period. We find that greater grades transparency decreases educational performance, as measured by the number of examinations passed and grade point average (GPA). However, self-reported satisfaction, as measured by surveys conducted after feedback is provided but before students take their examinations, increases. We provide a theoretical framework to understand these results, focusing on the role of prior beliefs and using out-of-trial surveys to test the model. In the absence of treatment, a majority of students underestimate their position in the grade distribution, suggesting that the updated information is \u201cgood news\u201d for many students. Moreover, the negative effect on performance is driven by those students who underestimate their position in the absence of feedback. Students who overestimate initially their position, if anything, respond positively. The performance effects are short lived-by the time students graduate, they have similar accumulated GPA and graduation rates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Natural field experiment", "Ranking", "Relative performance feedback", "School performance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Educational performance", "Grade point average", "Natural fields", "Ranking", "Relative performance", "School performance", "Theoretical framework", "Updated informations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070983499", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"12239700400": {"Name": "Azmat G.", "AuthorID": "12239700400", "AffiliationID": "60083821, 60003059", "AffiliationName": "Sciences Po and Centre for Economic Performance, LSE"}, "24398277700": {"Name": "Bagues M.", "AuthorID": "24398277700", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University, IZA"}, "6602192383": {"Name": "Cabrales A.", "AuthorID": "6602192383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "22937800100": {"Name": "Iriberri N.", "AuthorID": "22937800100", "AffiliationID": "60027856, 60104285", "AffiliationName": "University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science"}}}
