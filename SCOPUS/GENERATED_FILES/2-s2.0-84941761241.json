Monitoring drug release from the drug carrier is still a daunting challenge in the field of nanomedicine. To overcome such a challenge, we propose to use porous Nd3+-doped CaTiO3 nanofibers, which can be excited by NIR I to emit NIR II light, to carry drugs to test the concept of monitoring drug release from the nanofibers by detecting the NIR II emission intensity. Towards this end, we first used electrospinning to prepare porous Nd3+-doped CaTiO3 nanofibers by adding micelle-forming surfactant Pluronic F127, followed by annealing to remove the organic component. After a model drug, ibuprofen, was loaded into the porous nanofibers, the drug release from the nanofibers into the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was monitored by detecting the NIR II emission from the nanofibers. We found that the release of the drug molecules from the nanofibers into the PBS solution triggers the quenching of NIR II emission by the hydroxyl groups in the surrounding media. Consequently, more drug release corresponded to more reduction in the intensity of the NIR II emission, allowing us to monitor the drug release by simply detecting the intensity of NIR II from the nanofibers. In addition, we demonstrated that tuning the amount of micelle-forming surfactant Pluronic F127 enabled us to tune the porosity of the nanofibers and thus the drug release kinetics. This study suggests that Nd3+ doped CaTiO3 nanostructures can serve as a promising drug delivery platform with the potential to monitor drug release kinetics by detecting the tissue-penetrating NIR emission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Drug release kinetics", "Emission intensity", "Near infrared spectra", "Optical transparency", "Organic components", "Phosphate buffered saline solutions", "Porous nanofibers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941761241", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"50262023000": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "50262023000", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "56580688800": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "56580688800", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "55232671700": {"Name": "Ren Z.", "AuthorID": "55232671700", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "13611782100": {"Name": "Weng W.", "AuthorID": "13611782100", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "7202923438": {"Name": "Han G.", "AuthorID": "7202923438", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "7201498082": {"Name": "Mao C.", "AuthorID": "7201498082", "AffiliationID": "60030931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Stephenson Life Sciences Research Center, University of Oklahoma"}, "55418069300": {"Name": "Ahmad Z.", "AuthorID": "55418069300", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "Leicester School of Pharmacy, De Montfort University"}, "35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
