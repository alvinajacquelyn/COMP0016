Although several studies have reported that subjective caregiver burden is related to depressive symptoms there are no systematic reviews quantifying this association. Objective To establish the extent to which subjective caregiver burden is associated with depressive symptoms and whether this association would vary by study or care characteristics. Methods We searched major databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and ISI Proceedings up to March 2018, and conducted a meta-analysis of included studies. Summary estimates of the association were obtained using a random-effects model to improve generalisation of findings. Results After screening of 4,688 articles, 55 studies were included providing a total of 56 independent comparisons with a total of 9,847 carers from data across 20 countries. There was a large, positive association between subjective caregiver burden and depressive symptoms (r = 0.514; 95% CI = 0.486, 0.541), with very low heterogeneity amongst individual studies (I2 = 8.6%). Sensitivity analyses showed no differences between cross-sectional or repeated measures (r = 0.521; 95% CI = 0.491, 0.550; 51 samples) and longitudinal studies (r = 0.454; 95% CI = 0.398, 0.508; 6 samples). We found a higher effect size for those caring for people living with dementia compared to those caring for frail older people, and stroke survivors. Carer sex, age and kinship did not change the estimate of the effect. Conclusions Subjective caregiver burden is a significant risk factor for depressive symptoms in carers of older people and may precipitate clinical depression. Those caring for people with dementia experience greater burden. There is a need for longitudinal evaluations examining the effects of potential mediators of the association of subjective burden and depressive symptoms. Future interventions should test whether minimizing subjective burden may modify the risk of developing depression in carers of older relatives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Anxiety", "Caregivers", "Dementia", "Depression", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Peer Review", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066450561", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"18233340800": {"Name": "Del-Pino-Casado R.", "AuthorID": "18233340800", "AffiliationID": "60014586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, University of Ja\u00e9n"}, "57209072738": {"Name": "Cardosa M.", "AuthorID": "57209072738", "AffiliationID": "60014586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, University of Ja\u00e9n"}, "57197822139": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "57197822139", "AffiliationID": "60014586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, University of Ja\u00e9n"}, "23397844800": {"Name": "Orgeta V.", "AuthorID": "23397844800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
