Here, we describe the development of NOTUM inhibitors that restore Wnt signaling for use in in vitro disease models where NOTUM over activity is an underlying cause. A crystallographic fragment screen with NOTUM identified 2-phenoxyacetamide 3 as binding in the palmitoleate pocket with modest inhibition activity (IC50 33 \u03bcM). Optimization of hit 3 by SAR studies guided by SBDD identified indazole 38 (IC50 0.032 \u03bcM) and isoquinoline 45 (IC50 0.085 \u03bcM) as potent inhibitors of NOTUM. The binding of 45 to NOTUM was rationalized through an X-ray co-crystal structure determination which showed a flipped binding orientation compared to 3. However, it was not possible to combine NOTUM inhibition activity with metabolic stability as the majority of the compounds tested were rapidly metabolized in an NADPH-independent manner.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070757876", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57198770573": {"Name": "Atkinson B.N.", "AuthorID": "57198770573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "7005337410": {"Name": "Steadman D.", "AuthorID": "7005337410", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "57194386685": {"Name": "Sipthorp J.", "AuthorID": "57194386685", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "57215784162": {"Name": "Jeganathan F.", "AuthorID": "57215784162", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "57210443031": {"Name": "Lines G.", "AuthorID": "57210443031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "57210447848": {"Name": "Frew S.", "AuthorID": "57210447848", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "55751351200": {"Name": "Monaghan A.", "AuthorID": "55751351200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "24279662700": {"Name": "Bictash M.", "AuthorID": "24279662700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research UK UCL Drug Discovery Institute, University College London Cruciform Building"}, "7005747441": {"Name": "Fish P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747441", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "55362411800": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "55362411800", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "54396239500": {"Name": "Vecchia L.", "AuthorID": "54396239500", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "57193205370": {"Name": "Ruza R.R.", "AuthorID": "57193205370", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "7404236867": {"Name": "Jones E.Y.", "AuthorID": "7404236867", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "24335111400": {"Name": "Kj\u00e6r S.", "AuthorID": "24335111400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}}}
