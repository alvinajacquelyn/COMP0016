Some suggestions for future work are presented. It is shown that study of complex control systems is a long term task for researchers and control engineers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex control systems"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042866822", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56642060300": {"Name": "Edwards C.", "AuthorID": "56642060300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
