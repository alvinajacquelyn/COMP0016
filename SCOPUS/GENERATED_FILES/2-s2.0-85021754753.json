Because the subventricular zone is the main source of neural stem cells, we aimed at characterizing the subventricular zone using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to show subventricular zone involvement in glioblastoma. Methods We prospectively included 93 patients with primary glioblastomas who underwent preoperative DTI. The nonenhancing high fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal was used to describe the infiltrative tumor margin. We used a 5-mm margin surrounding the lateral ventricles to define the subventricular zone. The subventricular zone with high FLAIR was compared with the subventricular zone without high FLAIR, control high FLAIR outside the subventricular zone and control contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Normalized DTI parameters were calculated and compared between the different regions. Results The subventricular zone with high FLAIR showed increased isotropic p values compared with the subventricular zone without high FLAIR (t126 = 3.9; P < 0.001) and control regions (t179 = 1.9; P = 0.046). Anisotropic q and fractional anisotropy values were lower in regions with high FLAIR compared with the subventricular zone without high FLAIR (t181 = 11.6, P < 0.001 and t184 =12.4, P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion DTI data showed that the subventricular zone is involved in glioblastoma with increased isotropic p values in the subventricular zone with high FLAIR, indicating tumor infiltration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion tensor imaging", "Glioblastoma", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Neural stem cells", "Subventricular zone"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain Neoplasms", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Lateral Ventricles", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021754753", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57193699776": {"Name": "van Dijken B.", "AuthorID": "57193699776", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "57188995396": {"Name": "Yan J.", "AuthorID": "57188995396", "AffiliationID": "60073391", "AffiliationName": "Chang Gung University College of Medicine"}, "56716364900": {"Name": "Boonzaier N.", "AuthorID": "56716364900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57194697287": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "57194697287", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "35812591500": {"Name": "van der Hoorn A.", "AuthorID": "35812591500", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Center for Medical Imaging\u2013North East Netherlands"}, "57203046721": {"Name": "Price S.", "AuthorID": "57203046721", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "10141169500": {"Name": "van Laar P.", "AuthorID": "10141169500", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Center for Medical Imaging\u2013North East Netherlands"}}}
