This paper investigates the effects of jamming on the micro-Doppler classification performance and explores a potential deep topology enabling low-bandwidth data fusion between nodes in a multistatic radar network. The topology is based on an array of three independent deep neural networks (DNNs) functioning cooperatively to achieve joint classification. In addition to this, a further DNN is trained to detect the presence of jamming, and from this, it attempts to remedy the degradation effects in the data fusion process. This is applied to the real experimental data gathered with the multistatic radar system, NetRAD, of a human operating with seven combinations of holding a rifle-like object and a heavy backpack that is slung on their shoulders. The resilience of the proposed network is tested by applying synthetic jamming signals into specific radar nodes and observing the networks' ability to respond to these undesired effects. The results of this are compared with a traditional voting system topology, serving as a convenient baseline for this paper.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNN", "fusion", "human micro Doppler", "multistatic radar", "Radar", "radar classification", "synthetic jamming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification performance", "Data fusion process", "Degradation effect", "Jamming signals", "Low-bandwidth", "Micro-Doppler", "Voting systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068691556", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57202333097": {"Name": "Patel J.", "AuthorID": "57202333097", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic andand Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic andand Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
