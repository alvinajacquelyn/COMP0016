It is a well-known fact that it is beneficial for radial turbocharger turbines to have a higher efficiency at low U=Cis region, since the pulsating engine exhaust gas at low U=Cis region (with high pre\u00dfure and temperature) carries more energy compared to that at high U=Cis region (with low pre\u00dfure and temperature). The improvement of Total to Static efficiency at lowU=Cis region will help the turbine extract more energy from the exhaust gas and thereby increase the turbine cycle-averaged Total to Static efficiency. In the past there has been some attempts to move the peak U=Cis to lower values by using conventional or direct design approach on mixed flow impellers. But this approach usually results in reduction of stage performance. In this paper, a methodology is presented to control and move the radial turbine peak efficiency U=Cis to lower values by using a 3D inverse design method. The stage performance is measured by using steady CFD analysis. Furthermore detailed stre\u00df and vibration analysis are presented on the mechanical performance of the new design.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Design approaches", "Higher efficiency", "Inverse design methods", "Mechanical performance", "Mixed-flow impeller", "Peak efficiency", "Stage performance", "Turbocharger turbines"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954138621", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"56703554900": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56703554900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003688013": {"Name": "Zangeneh M.", "AuthorID": "7003688013", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
