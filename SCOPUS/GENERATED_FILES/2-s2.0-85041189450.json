More recent traffic engineering efforts aim to reduce congestion and/or increase utilization within the status quo of greedy, shortest-path first routing on a sparse topology. In this paper, we argue that this status quo of routing and topology is fundamentally at odds with placing traffic so as to minimize latency for users while avoiding congestion. We advocate instead provider backbone topologies that are more mesh-like, and hence better at providing multiple low-latency paths, and a routing system that directly considers latency minimization and congestion avoidance while dynamically placing traffic on multiple unequal-cost paths. We offer a research agenda for achieving this new low-latency approach to WAN topology design and routing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Back-bone topology", "Congestion avoidance", "Research agenda", "Routing system", "Shortest path", "Shortest path firsts", "Topology design", "Traffic Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041189450", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55508553600": {"Name": "Gvozdiev N.", "AuthorID": "55508553600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "35220581300": {"Name": "Vissicchio S.", "AuthorID": "35220581300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "57203106115": {"Name": "Karp B.", "AuthorID": "57203106115", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "7006454610": {"Name": "Handley M.", "AuthorID": "7006454610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}}}
