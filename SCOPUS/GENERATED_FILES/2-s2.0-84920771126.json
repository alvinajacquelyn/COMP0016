All rights reserved.Lattice materials composed of hollow nanocrystalline struts have recently made it possible to access new regions of material property space, by exploiting structural efficiencies along multiple length scales (nanometre to centimetre range). An important design issue for these materials is to understand how the failure mechanisms that act at these scales affect the macroscopic mechanical properties. In this study, we tested hollow nanocrystalline cylinders of two different grain sizes (20 nm and 100 nm) in uniaxial compression to investigate the effect of grain size on dominant failure mechanisms, and the influence of the latter on the compressive strength. The finite element method was used to model the interaction of the three observed failure mechanisms: shell buckling (SB), yielding (Y) and fracture (F). Depending on the grain size and geometry, the failure sequence can be SB-Y-F, Y-SB-F, SB-Y or Y-SB, the order of which has important implications in defining the limits of mechanical performance. One such implication is that when shell buckling occurs in the inelastic regime of the material, the macroscopic strength increase due to grain size refinement can be greater than the inherent yield strength increase of the material. Second, material fracture and shell buckling may not be competing failure mechanisms, which means that the effectiveness of grain size reduction in increasing the structural efficiency of cylindrical strut members can span the entire Hall-Petch range of the material.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buckling", "Cellular solids", "Damage initiation", "Fracture", "Nanocrystalline material"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular solids", "Damage initiation", "Grain size refinement", "Grain-size reduction", "Macroscopic mechanical properties", "Mechanical performance", "Structural efficiencies", "Uni-axial compression"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920771126", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"23970105700": {"Name": "Bele E.", "AuthorID": "23970105700", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto"}, "55578703800": {"Name": "Singh C.", "AuthorID": "55578703800", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto"}, "6603288057": {"Name": "Hibbard G.", "AuthorID": "6603288057", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto"}}}
