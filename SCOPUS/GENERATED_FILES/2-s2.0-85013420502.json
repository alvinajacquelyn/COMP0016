All rights reserved.Background:There is limited data on results of central re-testing of samples from patients with invasive breast cancer categorised in their local hospital laboratories as oestrogen receptor (ER) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor homologue 2 (HER2) negative.Methods:The Optimal Personalised Treatment of early breast cancer usIng Multiparameter Analysis preliminary study (OPTIMA prelim) was the feasibility phase of a randomised controlled trial to validate the use of multiparameter assay-directed chemotherapy decisions in the UK National Health Service (NHS). Eligibility criteria included ER positivity and HER2 negativity. Central re-testing of receptor status was mandatory.Results:Of the 431 patients tested centrally, discrepant results between central and local laboratory results were identified in only 19 (4.4%; 95% confidence interval 2.5-6.3%) patients (with 21 tumours). On central review, seven patients had cancers that were ER-negative (1.6%) and 13 (3.0%) patients with 15 tumours had HER2-positive disease, including one tumour discrepant for both biomarkers.Conclusions:Central re-testing of receptor status of invasive breast cancers in the UK NHS setting shows a high level of reproducibility in categorising tumours as ER-positive and HER2-negative, and raises questions regarding the cost effectiveness and clinical value of central re-testing in this sub-group of breast cancers in this setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Decision Support Systems, Clinical", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Medical Laboratory Science", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prognosis", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Reproducibility of Results", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013420502", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "57114108000": {"Name": "Campbell A.F.", "AuthorID": "57114108000", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Campus"}, "56657083700": {"Name": "Marshall A.", "AuthorID": "56657083700", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Campus"}, "7403290304": {"Name": "Dunn J.A.", "AuthorID": "7403290304", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Campus"}, "36063907600": {"Name": "Bartlett J.M.S.", "AuthorID": "36063907600", "AffiliationID": "60101854", "AffiliationName": "Ontario Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57213441145": {"Name": "Allen D.", "AuthorID": "57213441145", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Advanced Diagnostics, University College London"}, "7006176706": {"Name": "Falzon M.", "AuthorID": "7006176706", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospitals"}, "35480217900": {"Name": "Makris A.", "AuthorID": "35480217900", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "6603688989": {"Name": "Hughes-Davies L.", "AuthorID": "6603688989", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Centre, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402952709": {"Name": "Stein R.C.", "AuthorID": "7402952709", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals"}}}
