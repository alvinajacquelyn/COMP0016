Whether x-ray-based computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on local magnetic fields within a patient's tissues, different modalities generate images with uniquely different appearances and information content due to the physical differences of the image-acquisition process. Researchers are developing sophisticated ways to extract a greater amount of the information contained within these images. This paper summarizes the imaging-based research presented orally at the 2018 International Conference of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (iMig) in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, held May 2\u20135, 2018. Presented topics included advances in the imaging of preclinical mesothelioma models to inform clinical therapeutic strategies, optimization of the time delay between contrast administration and image acquisition for maximized enhancement of mesothelioma tumor on CT, an investigation of image-based criteria for clinical tumor and nodal staging of mesothelioma by contrast-enhanced CT, an investigation of methods for the extraction of mesothelioma tumor volume from MRI and the association of volume with patient survival, the use of deep learning for mesothelioma tumor segmentation in CT, and an evaluation of CT-based radiomics for the prognosis of mesothelioma patient survival.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical staging", "Deep learning", "Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT", "Patient outcomes", "Preclinical imaging", "Radiomics", "Tumor segmentation", "Tumor volume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Congresses as Topic", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mesothelioma", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Pleura", "Pleural Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Public Opinion", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061638830", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7003375808": {"Name": "Armato S.G.", "AuthorID": "7003375808", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago"}, "57191229193": {"Name": "Gudmundsson E.", "AuthorID": "57191229193", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago"}, "7202122104": {"Name": "Francis R.J.", "AuthorID": "7202122104", "AffiliationID": "60189720, 60009834, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Western Australia Medical School"}, "13613459000": {"Name": "Katz S.I.", "AuthorID": "13613459000", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "8403568200": {"Name": "Ak G.", "AuthorID": "8403568200", "AffiliationID": "60029016", "AffiliationName": "Lung and Pleural Cancers Research and Clinical Center, Eskisehir Osmangazi University"}, "6602911064": {"Name": "Opitz I.", "AuthorID": "6602911064", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Division of Thoracic Surgery, University Hospital Zurich"}, "8921989700": {"Name": "Blyth K.G.", "AuthorID": "8921989700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow"}, "57189700815": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57189700815", "AffiliationID": "60085927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Ottawa Hospital"}}}
