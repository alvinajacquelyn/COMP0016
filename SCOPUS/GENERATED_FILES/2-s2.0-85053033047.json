This methodological discussion explores the synergies between grounded theory, information literacy and visual research to establish a research agenda for the extension of grounded theory method within LIS. The discussion draws upon recent theoretical and methodological advances to outline the challenges and opportunities of the proposed shift in focus for the development of a LIS researchers methodological toolbox. The ongoing exploration of grounded theory method is vital for the creation of richer and more complex theorising about the ways in which people engage with information within evolving settings and spaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053033047", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"25627791300": {"Name": "Hicks A.", "AuthorID": "25627791300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, Foster Court, University College London"}}}
