Like audio, video is easy to sample from the real world but hard to segment into clean reusable elements. Reusing a video clip means non-linear editing and compositing with novel footage. The new context dictates how carefully a clip must be prepared, so our end-to-end approach enables previewing and easy iteration. We convert static-camera videos into loopable sequences, synthesizing them in response to simple end-user requests. This is hard because a) users want essentially semantic-level control over the synthesized video content, and b) automatic loop-finding is brittle and leaves users limited opportunity to work through problems. We propose a human-in-the-loop system where adding effort gives the user progressively more creative control. Artists help us evaluate how our trigger interfaces can be used for authoring of videos and video-performances. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).
