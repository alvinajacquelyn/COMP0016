However, it is not known if microvascularization of the fetus is augmented when pregnancy occurs at high altitude. Fifty-three healthy term newborns in Puno, Peru (3,840 m) were compared with sea-level controls. Pre-and postductal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was determined. Cerebral and calf muscle regional tissue oxygenation was measured using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Skin microcirculation was noninvasively measured using incident dark field imaging. Pre-and postductal SpO2 in Peruvian babies was 88.1 and 88.4%, respectively, which was 10.4 and 9.7% lower than in newborns at sea level (P=0.001). Cerebral and regional oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the Peruvian newborns (cerebral: 71.0 vs. 74.9%; regional: 68.5 vs. 76.0%, P=0.001). Transcutaneously measured total vessel density in the Peruvian newborns was 14% higher than that in the newborns born at sea level (29.7 vs. 26.0 mm/mm2; P=0.001). This study demonstrates that microvascular vessel density in neonates born to mothers living at high altitude is higher than that in neonates born at sea level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hypoxia", "Incident dark field imaging", "Microcirculation", "Near infrared spectroscopy", "Neonates", "Oxygen profiling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007438967", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57191329264": {"Name": "Gassmann N.N.", "AuthorID": "57191329264", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center"}, "56219399200": {"Name": "Gassmann M.", "AuthorID": "56219399200", "AffiliationID": "60089523", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, UPCH"}, "36612413200": {"Name": "Van Elteren H.A.", "AuthorID": "36612413200", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center"}, "55586806500": {"Name": "Goos T.G.", "AuthorID": "55586806500", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "54385836500": {"Name": "Reiss I.K.M.", "AuthorID": "54385836500", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center"}, "7003757160": {"Name": "De Jonge R.C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003757160", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center"}, "57191338567": {"Name": "Morales C.R.", "AuthorID": "57191338567", "AffiliationID": "60071237, 60089523", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Adaptation to High Altitude, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH)"}, "6602773545": {"Name": "Rivera-Ch M.", "AuthorID": "6602773545", "AffiliationID": "60089523", "AffiliationName": "Center of Research for Integral and Sustainable Development (CIDiS), UPCH"}, "55915133100": {"Name": "Huicho L.", "AuthorID": "55915133100", "AffiliationID": "60089523", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, UPCH"}, "24594583700": {"Name": "Martin D.S.", "AuthorID": "24594583700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, Univesity College London Hospital National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57191339954": {"Name": "Peralta P.C.", "AuthorID": "57191339954", "AffiliationID": "60112632", "AffiliationName": "Hospital III Puno EsSalud"}, "57191335875": {"Name": "Del Carpio A.P.", "AuthorID": "57191335875", "AffiliationID": "60112632", "AffiliationName": "Hospital III Puno EsSalud"}, "57191334642": {"Name": "MacHaca S.A.", "AuthorID": "57191334642", "AffiliationID": "60112632", "AffiliationName": "Hospital III Puno EsSalud"}}}
