Wesummarize these predictors fromseveral significant perspectives including their design, outputs and availability. Weperformempirical assessment ofmethods that offer web servers using a new benchmark data set characterized by a more complete annotation that includes binding residues transferred fromthe same or similar proteins.Weshowthat predictors of DNA-binding (RNA-binding) residues offer relatively strong predictive performance but they are unable to properly separate DNA- fromRNA-binding residues.Wedesign andempirically assess several types of consensuses and demonstrate that machine learning (ML)-based approaches provide improved predictive performancewhen compared with the individual predictors of DNA-binding residues or RNA-binding residues.Wealso formulate and execute first-of-its-kind study that targets combined prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding residues.Wedesign and test three types of consensuses for this prediction and conclude that this novel approach that relies on ML design provides better predictive quality than individual predictors when tested on prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding residues individually. It also substantially improves discrimination between these two types of nucleic acids. Our results suggest that development of a new generation of predictors would benefit fromusing training data sets that combine both RNA- andDNA-binding proteins, designing new inputs that specifically target either DNA- or RNA-binding residues and pursuing combined prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding residues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA-binding proteins", "Protein-DNA binding", "Protein-nucleic acids binding", "Protein-RNA binding", "RNA-binding proteins", "Transcription factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Computational Biology", "Consensus Sequence", "Databases, Protein", "DNA", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Protein Binding", "RNA", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960083427", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57215039934": {"Name": "Yan J.", "AuthorID": "57215039934", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}, "6602308535": {"Name": "Kurgan L.", "AuthorID": "6602308535", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}, "57202605353": {"Name": "Friedrich S.", "AuthorID": "57202605353", "AffiliationID": "116423070", "AffiliationName": "Life Laboratory in Solna"}}}
