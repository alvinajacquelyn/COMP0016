Specifically, it is claimed that there are no interesting differences (in either interpretation or processing) between hyperbolic and metaphorical uses (Sperber & Wilson, 2008). In recent work, we have set out to provide a more fine-grained articulation of the similarities and differences between hyperbolic and metaphorical uses and their relation to literal uses (Carston & Wearing, 2011, 2014). We have defended the view that hyperbolic use involves a shift of magnitude along a dimension which is intrinsic to the encoded meaning of the hyperbole vehicle, while metaphor involves a multi-dimensional qualitative shift away from the encoded meaning of the metaphor vehicle. In this article, we present three experiments designed to test the predictions of this analysis, using a variety of tasks (paraphrase elicitation, self-paced reading and sentence verification). The results of the study support the view that hyperbolic and metaphorical interpretations, despite their commonalities as loose uses of language, are significantly different.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919722761", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"22956536900": {"Name": "Rubio-Fern\u00e1ndez P.", "AuthorID": "22956536900", "AffiliationID": "113498811", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature"}, "6602539659": {"Name": "Carston R.", "AuthorID": "6602539659", "AffiliationID": "113498811", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature"}, "13905436900": {"Name": "Wearing C.", "AuthorID": "13905436900", "AffiliationID": "60009828", "AffiliationName": "Wellesley College"}}}
