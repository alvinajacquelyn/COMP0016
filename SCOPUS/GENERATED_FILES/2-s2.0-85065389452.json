Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Non-invasive imaging plays an important role in diagnosing and monitoring peripheral artery disease (PAD). Doppler ultrasound imaging can be used for measuring blood flow in this context. However, this technique frequently provides low contrast for flow in small vessels. Photoacoustic imaging can allow for the visualization of blood in small vessels, with direct contrast from optical absorption of hemoglobin. In this work, we investigate the potential applications of a compact LED-based photoacoustic (850 nm) and ultrasound imaging system for visualizing human peripheral blood vessels during cuff occlusion. Each measurement comprised three stages. First, a baseline measurement of a digital artery of a human finger from a volunteer without a diagnosis of PAD was performed for several seconds. Second, arterial blood flow was stopped using an occlusion cuff, with a rapid increase of pressure up to 220 mm Hg. Third, the occlusion cuff was released rapidly. Raw photoacoustic and ultrasound image data (frame rate: 70 Hz) were recorded for the entire duration of the measurement (20 s). The average photoacoustic image amplitude over an image region that enclosed the digital artery was calculated. With this value, pulsations of image amplitudes from the arteries was clearly visualized. The average photoacoustic image amplitude decreased during the increase in cuff pressure and it was followed by a rapid recovery during cuff release. With real-time non-invasive measurements of peripheral blood vessel dynamics in vivo, the compact LED-based system could be valuable for point-of-care imaging to guide treatment of PAD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["LED", "Peripheral artery disease", "Photoacoustic imaging", "Ultrasound imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Human peripheral blood", "Non- invasive measurements", "Non-invasive imaging", "Peripheral artery disease", "Peripheral blood vessels", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Ultrasound imaging", "Ultrasound imaging systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065389452", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36337500900": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "36337500900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, Lambeth Wing St. Thomas' Hospital"}, "56038489100": {"Name": "Maneas E.", "AuthorID": "56038489100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57208646435": {"Name": "Trung Huynh N.", "AuthorID": "57208646435", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57208656335": {"Name": "Montana Brown N.", "AuthorID": "57208656335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56922126800": {"Name": "Kuniyil Ajith Singh M.", "AuthorID": "56922126800", "AffiliationID": "122033229", "AffiliationName": "Research and Business Development Division, CYBERDYNE INC, Cambridge Innovation Center"}, "57217977012": {"Name": "Gilbert-Kawai E.", "AuthorID": "57217977012", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "55820371500": {"Name": "West S.J.", "AuthorID": "55820371500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College Hospital"}}}
