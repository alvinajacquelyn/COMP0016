To address these shortcomings, we used the electrospray process as a reproducible, synthesis technique to manufacture highly porous (>94%) microspheres while maintaining control over particle structure and size. Here we report a successful formulation recipe used to generate spherical poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres using the electrospray (ES) coupled with a novel thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) process with a tailored Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) collection scheme.We show how size, shape and porosity of resulting microspheres can be controlled by judiciously varying electrospray processing parameters and we demonstrate examples in which the particle size (and porosity) affect release kinetics. The effect of electrospray treatment on the particles and their physicochemical properties are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, confocal Raman microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The microspheres manufactured here have successfully demonstrated long-term delivery (i.e. 1. week) of an active agent, enabling sustained release of a dye with minimal physical degradation and have verified the potential of scalable electrospray technologies for an innovative TIPS-based microsphere production protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrosprays", "Microspheres", "Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)", "Thermally induced phase separation (TIPS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Confocal Raman microscopy", "Electrospray process", "Electrosprays", "Mercury intrusion porosimetry", "Physicochemical property", "Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)", "Processing parameters", "Thermally induced phase separation", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Kinetics", "Lactic Acid", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Microspheres", "Particle Size", "Polyglycolic Acid", "Porosity", "Rhodamines", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman", "Surface Properties", "Thermogravimetry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955505123", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57075607700": {"Name": "Malik S.", "AuthorID": "57075607700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56386662300": {"Name": "Ng W.", "AuthorID": "56386662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55574192663": {"Name": "Bowen J.", "AuthorID": "55574192663", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "57075339000": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "57075339000", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Yale University"}, "57203191381": {"Name": "Gomez A.", "AuthorID": "57203191381", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Yale University"}, "7402617225": {"Name": "Day R.", "AuthorID": "7402617225", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
