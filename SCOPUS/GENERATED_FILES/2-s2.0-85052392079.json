Recent technological advances in the 5G domain hold the promise to unlock the potential of the media industry by offering high quality media services through dynamic efficient resource allocation. Actual implementations are now required to validate whether advanced media applications can be realised benefiting from ultra-low latency, very-high bandwidth and flexible dynamic configuration offered by these new 5G networks. A truly integrated approach is needed that focuses on the media applications not only on the management of generic network functions and the orchestration of resources at the various radio, fronthaul/backhaul, edge and core network segments. The H2020 5G PPP Phase 2 project 5G-MEDIA [1] leverages new options for more flexible, ad-hoc and cost-effective production workflows by replacing dedicated lines and hardware equipment with software functions (VNFs) facilitating (semi-) automated smart production in remote locations. Highly scalable virtualized media services deployed on or close to the edge reduce complexity for the user, ensure operational reliability and increase the Quality of Experience (QoE). Virtual compression engines have the potential to replace dedicated encoder/decoder hardware while the network optimisation (Cognitive Network Optimizer) in combination with the Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring helps to overcome the current internet best-effort principle and ensures that the required performance needs are met at all times.", "AuthorKeywords": ["broadcasting", "edge computing", "FaaS", "mobile contribution", "NFV", "NFVI", "Remote production", "SDN", "smart production", "VNF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-effective production", "Efficient resource allocation", "FaaS", "mobile contribution", "NFVI", "Operational reliability", "Quality of experience (QoE)", "Technological advances"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052392079", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"]], "AuthorData": {"35102594300": {"Name": "Keltsch M.", "AuthorID": "35102594300", "AffiliationID": "113432604", "AffiliationName": "IRT"}, "57203587260": {"Name": "Prokesch S.", "AuthorID": "57203587260", "AffiliationID": "113432604", "AffiliationName": "IRT"}, "57203589330": {"Name": "Gordo O.P.", "AuthorID": "57203589330", "AffiliationID": "108441776", "AffiliationName": "RTVE"}, "57202434085": {"Name": "Serrano J.", "AuthorID": "57202434085", "AffiliationID": "60028442", "AffiliationName": "UPM"}, "55234792400": {"Name": "Phan T.K.", "AuthorID": "55234792400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "56429521300": {"Name": "Fritzsch I.", "AuthorID": "56429521300", "AffiliationID": "121240785", "AffiliationName": "BitTubes"}}}
