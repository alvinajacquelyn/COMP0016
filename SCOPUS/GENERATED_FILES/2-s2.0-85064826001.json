Background: The circadian clock governs a large variety of fundamentally important physiological processes in all three domains of life. Consequently, asynchrony in timekeeping mechanisms could give rise to cellular dysfunction underpinning many disease pathologies including human neoplasms. Yet, detailed pan-cancer evidence supporting this notion has been limited. Methods: In an integrated approach uniting genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data of 21 cancer types (n = 18,484), we interrogated copy number and transcript profiles of 32 circadian clock genes to identify putative loss-of-function (Clock Loss ) and gain-of-function (Clock Gain ) players. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were employed to evaluate the prognostic significance of both gene sets. Results: Clock Loss and Clock Gain were associated with tumour-suppressing and tumour-promoting roles respectively. Downregulation of Clock Loss genes resulted in significantly higher mortality rates in five cancer cohorts (n = 2914): bladder (P = 0.027), glioma (P < 0.0001), pan-kidney (P = 0.011), clear cell renal cell (P < 0.0001) and stomach (P = 0.0007). In contrast, patients with high expression of oncogenic Clock Gain genes had poorer survival outcomes (n = 2784): glioma (P < 0.0001), pan-kidney (P = 0.0034), clear cell renal cell (P = 0.014), lung (P = 0.046) and pancreas (P = 0.0059). Both gene sets were independent of other clinicopathological features to permit further delineation of tumours within the same stage. Circadian reprogramming of tumour genomes resulted in activation of numerous oncogenic pathways including those associated with cancer stem cells, suggesting that the circadian clock may influence self-renewal mechanisms. Within the hypoxic tumour microenvironment, circadian dysregulation is exacerbated by tumour hypoxia in glioma, renal, lung and pancreatic cancers, resulting in additional death risks. Tumour suppressive Clock Loss genes were negatively correlated with hypoxia inducible factor-1A targets in glioma patients, providing a novel framework for investigating the hypoxia-clock signalling axis. Conclusions: Loss of timekeeping fidelity promotes tumour progression and influences clinical outcomes. Clock Loss and Clock Gain may offer novel druggable targets for improving patient prognosis. Both gene sets can be used for patient stratification in adjuvant chronotherapy treatment. Emerging interactions between the circadian clock and hypoxia may be harnessed to achieve therapeutic advantage using hypoxia-modifying compounds in combination with first-line treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circadian clock", "Gain-of-function", "Glioma", "Hypoxia", "Loss-of-function", "Oncogene", "Pan-cancer", "Renal cancer", "Tumour suppressor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carcinogenesis", "Circadian Clocks", "Disease Progression", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Multivariate Analysis", "Phenotype", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Regression Analysis", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors", "Transcriptome", "Tumor Hypoxia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064826001", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57201216073": {"Name": "Chang W.H.", "AuthorID": "57201216073", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "57193996849": {"Name": "Lai A.G.", "AuthorID": "57193996849", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
