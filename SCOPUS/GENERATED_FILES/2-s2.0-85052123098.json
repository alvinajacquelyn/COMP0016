We argue that a hermeneutical approach is a sound way to both conceptualise the phenomenon of Islam and a pedagogical opening to make sense of it, that may help overcome some of the weaknesses of the current ways of teaching about Islam.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diversity", "essentialism", "Hermeneutics", "Islam", "Muslims", "stereotypes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052123098", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"]], "AuthorData": {"8842676300": {"Name": "Panjwani F.", "AuthorID": "8842676300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6507128251": {"Name": "Revell L.", "AuthorID": "6507128251", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Reader in Religion and Education, Canterbury Christ Church University"}}}
