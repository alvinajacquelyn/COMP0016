There were strong connections between the 1944 Education Act and Circular 10/65. In particular, Michael Stewart, the Labour Party education policy review of 1957-1958, and the 1958 report Learning to Live that arose from this, played a key mediating role. Awareness of public opinion through the then novel device of market research and a determination to consolidate ambitious reforming ideals into a practical strategy for educational reform over the longer term formed part of the party\u2019s revisionist approach under Hugh Gaitskell, and helped to provide the basis for Labour\u2019s policy on comprehensive education when it returned to power in 1964.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comprehensive", "Labour Party", "Policy", "Politics", "Secondary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954382128", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"7003725787": {"Name": "McCulloch G.", "AuthorID": "7003725787", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
