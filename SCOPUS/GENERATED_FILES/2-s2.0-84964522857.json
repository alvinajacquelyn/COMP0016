All rights reserved.We present comprehensive derivations for the statistical models and methods for the use of pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR to characterize the molecular weight distribution of polymers via the well-known scaling law relating diffusion coefficients and molecular weights. We cover the lognormal and gamma distribution models and linear combinations of these distributions. Although the focus is on methodology, we illustrate the use experimentally with three polystyrene samples, comparing the NMR results to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements, test the accuracy and noise-sensitivity on simulated data, and provide code for implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gamma distribution", "Lognormal distribution", "Molecular weight distribution", "Polydispersity", "Pulsed gradient spin echo NMR", "Scaling law", "Self-diffusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gamma distribution", "Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)", "Linear combinations", "Log-normal distribution", "Molecular weight distribution of polymers", "Noise sensitivity", "Pulsed gradient spin echos", "Self-Diffusion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964522857", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56938170900": {"Name": "Williamson N.", "AuthorID": "56938170900", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes Campus"}, "35577381600": {"Name": "Nyd\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "35577381600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Resources, UCL Australia, University College London, Torrens Building"}, "51161820200": {"Name": "R\u00f6ding M.", "AuthorID": "51161820200", "AffiliationID": "60000585, 60079072", "AffiliationName": "SP Food and Bioscience"}}}
