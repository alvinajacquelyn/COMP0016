Published by BMJ.Objectives The size of the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) who may be eligible for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (HIV-PrEP) in England remains unknown. To plan for a national PrEP implementation trial, we estimated the number of MSM attending sexual health clinics (SHCs) that may be eligible for HIV-PrEP in England. Methods Sexually transmitted infection (STI) surveillance data from 2010 to 2015 from the GUMCAD surveillance system were used to estimate the annual number of HIV-negative MSM who may be eligible for HIV-PrEP in England. Based on national eligibility criteria, we identified HIV-negative MSM attending SHCs with a HIV-negative test in the past year and used diagnosed bacterial STI (past year) in this group as a proxy for condomless sex and eligibility for HIV-PrEP. We estimated HIV incidence per 100 person-years (py) in these groups in 2014. Results During 2010-2015, the number of HIV-negative MSM attending SHCs with a HIV-negative test in the past year doubled from 14 643 to 29 023, and HIV incidence in this group was 1.9 (95%CI 1.6 to 2.2) per 100 py in 2014. In the same period, the subgroup with a bacterial STI diagnosis (past year), and therefore considered potentially eligible for HIV-PrEP in this analysis, increased from 4365 (30%) to 10 276 (35%). HIV incidence in this subgroup was 3.3 (95%CI 2.7 to 4.0) per 100 py in 2014. Conclusions In 2015, approximately 10 000 HIV-negative MSM were considered potentially eligible for HIV-PrEP based on clinic history in GUMCAD. These data were used to inform the initial recruitment target for the PrEP Impact Trial and will inform future evaluations at a population level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gay men", "HIV", "policy", "public health", "surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "England", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Density", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064841616", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55776817200": {"Name": "Mitchell H.D.", "AuthorID": "55776817200", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "26427608100": {"Name": "Desai S.", "AuthorID": "26427608100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57197789900": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "57197789900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57044173800": {"Name": "Ong K.J.", "AuthorID": "57044173800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "36027423400": {"Name": "Furegato M.", "AuthorID": "36027423400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "56295144200": {"Name": "Hall V.", "AuthorID": "56295144200", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "26667658700": {"Name": "Desai M.", "AuthorID": "26667658700", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "25959731200": {"Name": "Saunders J.M.", "AuthorID": "25959731200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Health, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Epidemiology and Translational Research, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "55712560900": {"Name": "Gill O.N.", "AuthorID": "55712560900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}}}
