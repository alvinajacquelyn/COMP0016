This article discusses global coordination of efforts to institutionalize the inclusion of causal evidence from quasi-experiments in systematic reviews of health systems research. In particular, we are concerned with identifying opportunities for strengthening capacity at the global and local level for implementing protocols necessary to ensure that reviews that include quasi-experiments are consistently of the highest quality. We first describe the current state of the global infrastructure that facilitates the production of systematic reviews of health systems research. We identify five important types of actors operating within this infrastructure: review authors; synthesis collaborations that facilitate the review process; synthesis interest groups that supplement the work of the larger collaborations; review funders; and end users, including policymakers. Then, we examine opportunities for intervening to build the capacity of each type of actors to support the inclusion of quasi-experiments in reviews. Finally, we suggest practical next steps for proceeding with capacity building efforts. Because of the complexity and relative nascence of the field, we recommend a carefully planned and executed approach to strengthening global capacity for the inclusion of quasi-experimental studies in systematic reviews.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capacity building", "Health systems research", "Quasi-experiments", "Systematic reviews"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Humans", "Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Research", "Research Design", "Review Literature as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023782271", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"24830976900": {"Name": "Rockers P.C.", "AuthorID": "24830976900", "AffiliationID": "60018701", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Boston University School of Public Health"}, "35374403700": {"Name": "Tugwell P.", "AuthorID": "35374403700", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "34769948000": {"Name": "Grimshaw J.", "AuthorID": "34769948000", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "7202288559": {"Name": "Oliver S.", "AuthorID": "7202288559", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6602245046": {"Name": "Atun R.", "AuthorID": "6602245046", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health"}, "23011726900": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "23011726900", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "7003529676": {"Name": "R\u00f8ttingen J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003529676", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Management and Health Economics, University of Oslo"}, "7003865410": {"Name": "Fretheim A.", "AuthorID": "7003865410", "AffiliationID": "60009082", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services"}, "8400739000": {"Name": "Ranson M.K.", "AuthorID": "8400739000", "AffiliationID": "60112834", "AffiliationName": "World Bank"}, "23033804400": {"Name": "Daniels K.", "AuthorID": "23033804400", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council"}, "6506265520": {"Name": "Luiza V.L.", "AuthorID": "6506265520", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "National School of Public Health"}}}
