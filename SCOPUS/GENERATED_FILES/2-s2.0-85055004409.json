At 3 Tesla in NE babies, the objectives were to assess: (1) sensitivity and specificity of basal ganglia and thalamus (BGT) 1 H MRS Lac/NAA for the prediction of Bayley III outcomes at 2 years using optimised metabolite fitting (Tarquin) with threonine and total NAA; (2) prediction of motor outcome with diffusion-weighted MRI; (3) BGT Lac/NAA correlation with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) MRI score. Subjects and methods 55 (16 inborn, 39 outborn) infants at 39w+5 d (35w+5d-42w+0d) with NE admitted between February 2012 and August 2014 to University College London Hospitals for therapeutic hypothermia underwent MRI and 1 H MRS at 3T on day 2-14 (median day 5). MRIs were scored. Bayley III was assessed at 24 (22-26) months. Results 16 babies died (1 inborn, 15 outborn); 20, 19 and 21 babies had poor motor, cognitive and language outcomes. Using a threshold of 0.39, sensitivity and specificity of BGT Lac/NAA for 2-year motor outcome was 100% and 97%, cognition 90% and 97% and language 81% and 97%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for motor outcome of mean diffusivity (threshold 0.001 mm 2 /s) up to day 9 was 72% and 100% and fractional anisotropy (threshold 0.198) was 39% and 94%, respectively. Lac/NAA correlated with BGT injury on NICHD scores (2A, 2B, 3). Conclusion BGT Lac/NAA on 1 H MRS at 3T within 14 days accurately predicts 2-year motor, cognitive and language outcome and may be a marker directing decisions for therapies after cooling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["imaging", "neonatology", "neurodevelopment", "neurodisability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aspartic Acid", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Language Development Disorders", "Male", "Prognosis", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055004409", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"21135277300": {"Name": "Mitra S.", "AuthorID": "21135277300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55601032200": {"Name": "Uria-Avellanal C.", "AuthorID": "55601032200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60107609", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neonatology, Sidra Medicine"}, "7006008708": {"Name": "Kendall G.S.", "AuthorID": "7006008708", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women and Children, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204213389": {"Name": "Dinan M.", "AuthorID": "57204213389", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women and Children, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55672489300": {"Name": "McKinnon K.", "AuthorID": "55672489300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women and Children, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507532635": {"Name": "Gunny R.", "AuthorID": "6507532635", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women and Children, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24343915800": {"Name": "Huertas-Ceballos A.", "AuthorID": "24343915800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women and Children, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Engineering, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55220094000": {"Name": "Sokolska M.", "AuthorID": "55220094000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Engineering, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57207078497": {"Name": "Price D.", "AuthorID": "57207078497", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Engineering, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
