Design Retrospective case series. Participants Children diagnosed with choroideremia at a single institution. Methods Patients were identified using an electronic patient record system. Case notes and retinal imaging (color fundus photography [CFP], spectral-domain [SD] optical coherence tomography [OCT], and fundus autofluorescence [FAF]) then were reviewed. The results of genetic testing also were recorded. Main Outcome Measures Presenting symptoms, visual acuity, fundus changes (CFP, SD OCT, FAF), and CHM sequencing results. Results Twenty-nine patients were identified with a mean age at referral of 9 years (range, 3\u201316 years). CHM mutations were identified in 15 of 19 patients tested. Nyctalopia was the predominant symptom (66%). Five of 29 patients were asymptomatic at presentation. At the final follow-up visit (mean age, 16 years; range, 7\u201326 years), most maintained excellent visual acuity (mean, 0.98\u00b10.13 decimalized Snellen acuity). The first sign of retinopathy was widespread pigment clumping at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This later evolved to chorioretinal atrophy, most marked in the mid-peripheral retina. Peripapillary atrophy also was an early feature and was progressive in nature. Three different zones of FAF change were visible. Persistence of the inner retinal layers, detected by SD OCT, was visible at presentation in 15 of 27 patients. Subfoveal choroidal thickness decreased with age, whereas central retinal thickness increased over a similar interval. Four patients in whom visual acuity decreased over the follow-up period recorded a reduction in central retinal thickness. Conclusions Progressive structural changes occur at a time when central visual function is maintained. Pigmentary changes at the level of the RPE occur early in the disease course. Peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy, central retinal thickness, and subfoveal choroidal thickness are likely to be valuable in monitoring disease progression and should be considered as potential biomarkers in future therapeutic trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Choroid", "Choroideremia", "Disease Progression", "Electronic Health Records", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forecasting", "Fundus Oculi", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Male", "Ophthalmoscopy", "Retina", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991078992", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.N.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St. James's University Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco Medical School"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "39961598300": {"Name": "Islam F.", "AuthorID": "39961598300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
