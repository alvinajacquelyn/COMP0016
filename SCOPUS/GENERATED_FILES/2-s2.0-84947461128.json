Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 adolescent inpatients; transcripts were analysed thematically. Participants experienced inpatient treatment as offering a mix of benefits (e.g., supportive relationships) and drawbacks (e.g., living in a \"fake world\"). They anticipated the transition home as providing opportunities for personal growth and consolidation of new coping skills, but also posing challenges concerning re-entering the \"real world\" after the experience of being \"wrapped in cotton wool\". Self-determination theory and attachment theory offer two potential frameworks for understanding these opportunities and challenges. Inpatient care has the potential to foster key mechanisms for adaptive development, creating a platform for developing positive future behaviours. Community teams should work closely with inpatient units to support the generalisation of the young person's newly acquired coping skills.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Inpatient treatment", "Mental health", "Psychiatric", "Qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attitude to Health", "Female", "Humans", "Inpatients", "London", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Qualitative Research", "Residence Characteristics", "Transitional Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947461128", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56966369300": {"Name": "Gill F.", "AuthorID": "56966369300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7202738045": {"Name": "Butler S.", "AuthorID": "7202738045", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6603937770": {"Name": "Pistrang N.", "AuthorID": "6603937770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
