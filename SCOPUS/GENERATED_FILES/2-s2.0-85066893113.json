The HMM describes the brain as a complex adaptive system that functions to minimize the entropy of our sensory and physical states via action-perception cycles generated by hierarchical neural dynamics. First, we review the extant literature on the hierarchical structure of the brain. Next, we derive the HMM from a broader evolutionary systems theory that explains neural structure and function in terms of dynamic interactions across four nested levels of biological causation (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism). We then describe how the HMM aligns with a global brain theory in neuroscience called the free-energy principle, leveraging this theory to mathematically formulate neural dynamics across hierarchical spatiotemporal scales. We conclude by exploring the implications of the HMM for psychological inquiry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active inference", "Adaptive prior", "Developmental psychology", "Evolutionary psychology", "Evolutionary Systems Theory", "Free-Energy Principle", "Hierarchically Mechanistic Mind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "Brain", "Cognition", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Psychological Theory", "Systems Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066893113", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"8788773200": {"Name": "Badcock P.B.", "AuthorID": "8788773200", "AffiliationID": "60003438", "AffiliationName": "Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "56986708800": {"Name": "Ramstead M.J.D.", "AuthorID": "56986708800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}, "57193488272": {"Name": "Ploeger A.", "AuthorID": "57193488272", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "6507451799": {"Name": "Hohwy J.", "AuthorID": "6507451799", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cognition & Philosophy Lab, Monash University"}}}
