All rights reserved.The aim of this study is to understand whether the phasic Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device (CF-LVAD) support would increase the arterial pulsatility. A Micromed DeBakey CF-LVAD was used to apply phasic support in an ex-vivo experimental platform. CF-LVAD was operated over a cardiac cycle by phase-shifting the pulsatile pump control with respect to the heart cycle, in 0.05 s increments in each experiment. The pump flow rate was selected as the control variable and a reference model was used to operate the CF-LVAD at a pulsatile speed. Arterial pulse pressure was the highest (9 mmHg) when the peak pump flow is applied at the peak systole under varying speed CF-LVAD support over a cardiac cycle while it was the lowest (2 mmHg) when the peak pump flow was applied in the diastolic phase. The mean arterial pressure and mean CF-LVAD output were the same in each experiment while arterial pulse pressure and pulsatility index varied depending on the phase of reference pump flow rate signal. CF-LVAD speed should be synchronized considering the timing of peak systole over a cardiac cycle to increase the arterial pulsatility. Moreover, it is possible to decrease the arterial pulsatility under counter-pulsating CF-LVAD support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CF-LVAD", "phasic CF-LVAD support", "pulsatility", "varying speed"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arterial pulsatility", "Continuous flows", "Control variable", "Experimental platform", "Mean arterial pressure", "Pulsatility", "Pulsatility index", "Reference modeling", "Animals", "Arterial Pressure", "Arteries", "Diastole", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Pulsatile Flow", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999061519", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"35100053600": {"Name": "Bozkurt S.", "AuthorID": "35100053600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7004415668": {"Name": "Van De Vosse F.", "AuthorID": "7004415668", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Materials Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "7006945383": {"Name": "Rutten M.", "AuthorID": "7006945383", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Materials Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "12765550800": {"Name": "Van Tuijl S.", "AuthorID": "12765550800", "AffiliationID": "118250154", "AffiliationName": "LifeTec Group B.V."}}}
