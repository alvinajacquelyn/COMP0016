Purpose: Studies comparing CSF and PET tau biomarkers have included only commercial CSF assays examining specific phosphorylation sites (e.g. threonine 181, P-tau 181p ) and mid-domain tau (i.e. total tau, T-tau). Moreover, these studies did not examine CSF tau levels in relation to cerebral glucose metabolism. We thus aimed to examine CSF tau measures, using both commercial and novel assays, in relation to [ 18 F]THK5317 (tau) and [ 18 F]FDG PET (glucose metabolism). Methods: Fourteen Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients (seven prodromal, seven dementia) underwent [ 18 F]THK5317 and [ 18 F]FDG PET studies, with follow-up performed in ten subjects (six prodromal, four dementia) after 17 months. In addition to commercial assays, novel measures capturing N-terminus+mid-domain (tau N-Mid) and C-terminally truncated (tau-368) fragments were included. Results: While the levels of all forms of CSF tau were found to be inversely associated with baseline [ 18 F]FDG uptake, associations with baseline [ 18 F]THK5317 uptake varied in relation to the degree of isocortical hypometabolism ([ 18 F]FDG SUVR). Changes in the levels of the novel CSF markers tracked longitudinal changes in tracer uptake better than changes in P-tau 181p and T-tau levels, and improved concordance with dichotomized regional [ 18 F]THK5317 measures. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that neurodegeneration may modulate the relationship between CSF and PET tau biomarkers, and that, by comparison to P-tau 181p and T-tau, tau-368 and tau N-Mid may better capture tau pathology and synaptic impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "CSF", "PET imaging", "Tau", "[ 18 F]FDG", "[ 18 F]THK5317"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059651010", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35484474600": {"Name": "Leuzy A.", "AuthorID": "35484474600", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55552411700": {"Name": "Chiotis K.", "AuthorID": "55552411700", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55078223400": {"Name": "Saint-Aubert L.", "AuthorID": "55078223400", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, University Hospital of Toulouse"}, "22980407200": {"Name": "Lemoine L.", "AuthorID": "22980407200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7102413103": {"Name": "Nordberg A.", "AuthorID": "7102413103", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Theme Aging, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "56719727000": {"Name": "Cicognola C.", "AuthorID": "56719727000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "55883397700": {"Name": "H\u00f6glund K.", "AuthorID": "55883397700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7102011511": {"Name": "Andreasen N.", "AuthorID": "7102011511", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Theme Aging, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "7102173882": {"Name": "Ye K.", "AuthorID": "7102173882", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Experimental Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine"}}}
