Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei/1.The factors limiting the conductivity of fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) produced via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition are investigated. Modeling of the transport properties indicates that the measured Hall effect mobilities are far below the theoretical ionized impurity scattering limit. Significant compensation of donors by acceptors is present with a compensation ratio of 0.5, indicating that for every two donors there is approximately one acceptor. Hybrid density functional theory calculations of defect and impurity formation energies indicate the most probable acceptor-type defects. The fluorine interstitial defect has the lowest formation energy in the degenerate regime of FTO. Fluorine interstitials act as singly charged acceptors at the high Fermi levels corresponding to degenerately n-type films. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy of the fluorine impurities is consistent with the presence of substitutional FO donors and interstitial Fi in a roughly 2:1 ratio in agreement with the compensation ratio indicated by the transport modeling. Quantitative analysis through Hall effect, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and calibrated secondary ion mass spectrometry further supports the presence of compensating fluorine-related defects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier transport", "fluorine-doped stannic oxide", "fluorine-doped tin dioxide", "fluorine-doped tin oxide", "self-compensation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition", "Fluorine doped tin oxide", "Fluorine-doped", "Hybrid density functional theory", "Ionized impurity scattering", "Self compensation", "Stannic oxide", "X ray photoemission spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035119462", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57197829029": {"Name": "Swallow J.E.N.", "AuthorID": "57197829029", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy and Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "56429533600": {"Name": "Whittles T.J.", "AuthorID": "56429533600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy and Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "56311857400": {"Name": "Birkett M.", "AuthorID": "56311857400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy and Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "57197835439": {"Name": "Featherstone T.J.", "AuthorID": "57197835439", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy and Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "7005578699": {"Name": "Dhanak V.R.", "AuthorID": "7005578699", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy and Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "6603739582": {"Name": "Veal T.D.", "AuthorID": "6603739582", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy and Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.A.D.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7005152713": {"Name": "Peng N.", "AuthorID": "7005152713", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Surrey Ion Beam Centre, University of Surrey"}, "57197825835": {"Name": "Abbott A.", "AuthorID": "57197825835", "AffiliationID": "60088279", "AffiliationName": "NSG Group, European Technical Centre"}, "57197830183": {"Name": "Farnworth M.", "AuthorID": "57197830183", "AffiliationID": "60088279", "AffiliationName": "NSG Group, European Technical Centre"}, "36503602000": {"Name": "Cheetham K.J.", "AuthorID": "36503602000", "AffiliationID": "60088279", "AffiliationName": "NSG Group, European Technical Centre"}, "57197835120": {"Name": "Warren P.", "AuthorID": "57197835120", "AffiliationID": "60088279", "AffiliationName": "NSG Group, European Technical Centre"}}}
