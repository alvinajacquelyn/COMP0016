Here we show that the LUBAC components HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN have essential roles in late thymocyte differentiation, FOXP3 + regulatory T (Treg)-cell development and Treg cell homeostasis. LUBAC activity is not required to prevent TNF-induced apoptosis or necroptosis but is necessary for the transcriptional programme of the penultimate stage of thymocyte differentiation. Treg cell-specific ablation of HOIP causes severe Treg cell deficiency and lethal immune pathology, revealing an ongoing requirement of LUBAC activity for Treg cell homeostasis. These data reveal stage-specific requirements for LUBAC in coordinating the signals required for T-cell differentiation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Computational Biology", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genotype", "Homeostasis", "Mice", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "RNA", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "T-Lymphocytes", "Thymus Gland", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "Ubiquitination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996553629", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"18937501700": {"Name": "Teh C.E.", "AuthorID": "18937501700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "24465288900": {"Name": "Lalaoui N.", "AuthorID": "24465288900", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "56991974700": {"Name": "Jain R.", "AuthorID": "56991974700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "55193856200": {"Name": "Policheni A.N.", "AuthorID": "55193856200", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "56200452200": {"Name": "Heinlein M.", "AuthorID": "56200452200", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "16416788000": {"Name": "Alvarez-Diaz S.", "AuthorID": "16416788000", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "7201682776": {"Name": "Sheridan J.M.", "AuthorID": "7201682776", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "35215059500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "35215059500", "AffiliationID": "60027468", "AffiliationName": "Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"}, "14042104400": {"Name": "Kupresanin F.", "AuthorID": "14042104400", "AffiliationID": "60029482, 60015136", "AffiliationName": "ANZAC Research Institute, Concord Repatriation General Hospital"}, "7004405281": {"Name": "O'Reilly L.A.", "AuthorID": "7004405281", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "7102522582": {"Name": "Smyth G.K.", "AuthorID": "7102522582", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne"}, "57196701084": {"Name": "Bouillet P.", "AuthorID": "57196701084", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "7102640217": {"Name": "Strasser A.", "AuthorID": "7102640217", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "6604029886": {"Name": "Silke J.", "AuthorID": "6604029886", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "7403493916": {"Name": "Gray D.H.D.", "AuthorID": "7403493916", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "6603206215": {"Name": "Rieser E.", "AuthorID": "6603206215", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, University College London"}, "57192071339": {"Name": "Deuser S.", "AuthorID": "57192071339", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, University College London"}, "25228348600": {"Name": "Darding M.", "AuthorID": "25228348600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, University College London"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, University College London"}, "56436554200": {"Name": "Koay H.F.", "AuthorID": "56436554200", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60187111", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Advanced Molecular Imaging, University of Melbourne"}, "7103212260": {"Name": "Godfrey D.I.", "AuthorID": "7103212260", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60187111", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Advanced Molecular Imaging, University of Melbourne"}}}
