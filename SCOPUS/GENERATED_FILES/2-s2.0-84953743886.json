This study investigated factors associated with integrated HIV-1 DNA load during consistently suppressive first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Method: Total, integrated, and 2-long terminal repeats (LTR) circular HIV-1 DNA, residual plasma HIV-1 RNA, T-cell activation markers, and soluble CD14 (sCD14) were measured in peripheral blood of 50 patients that had received 1-14. years of efavirenz-based or nevirapine-based therapy. Results: Integrated HIV-1 DNA load (per 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) was median 1.9 log10 copies (interquartile range 1.7-2.2) and showed a mean difference of 0.2 log10 copies per 10years of suppressive ART (95% confidence interval -0.2, 0.6; p=0.28). It was positively correlated with total HIV-1 DNA load and frequency of CD8+HLA-DR/DP/DQ+ cells, and was also higher in subjects with higher sCD14 levels, but showed no correlation with levels of 2-LTR circular HIV-1 DNA and residual plasma HIV-1 RNA, or the frequency of CD4+CD38+ and CD8+CD38+ cells. Adjusting for pre-ART viral load, duration of suppressive ART, CD4 cell counts, residual plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and sCD14 levels, integrated HIV-1 DNA load was mean 0.5 log10 copies higher for each 50% higher frequency of CD8+HLA-DR/DP/DQ+ cells (95% confidence interval 0.2, 0.9; p=0.01). Conclusions: The observed positive association between integrated HIV-1 DNA load and frequency of CD8+DR/DP/DQ+ cells indicates that a close correlation between HIV persistence and immune activation continues during consistently suppressive therapy. The inducers of the distinct activation profile warrant further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activation", "Integration", "Persistence", "Reservoir", "Suppression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "DNA, Viral", "Female", "HIV-1", "HLA-DP Antigens", "HLA-DQ Antigens", "HLA-DR Antigens", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953743886", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56665477200": {"Name": "Ruggiero A.", "AuthorID": "56665477200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology (CIMI), Institute of Infection and Global Health (IGH), University of Liverpool"}, "6602667380": {"Name": "Pollakis G.", "AuthorID": "6602667380", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology (CIMI), Institute of Infection and Global Health (IGH), University of Liverpool"}, "26654732600": {"Name": "Beloukas A.", "AuthorID": "26654732600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology (CIMI), Institute of Infection and Global Health (IGH), University of Liverpool"}, "6701366859": {"Name": "Geretti A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701366859", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology (CIMI), Institute of Infection and Global Health (IGH), University of Liverpool"}, "57221435163": {"Name": "De Spiegelaere W.", "AuthorID": "57221435163", "AffiliationID": "60068590, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "HIV Translational Research Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University and University Hospital Ghent"}, "55387252300": {"Name": "Kiselinova M.", "AuthorID": "55387252300", "AffiliationID": "60068590, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "HIV Translational Research Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University and University Hospital Ghent"}, "8522177300": {"Name": "Vandekerckhove L.", "AuthorID": "8522177300", "AffiliationID": "60068590, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "HIV Translational Research Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University and University Hospital Ghent"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603818989": {"Name": "Strain M.", "AuthorID": "6603818989", "AffiliationID": "60030612, 60079887", "AffiliationName": "VA San Diego Healthcare System and Center for AIDS Research, University of California San Diego"}, "7202383409": {"Name": "Richman D.", "AuthorID": "7202383409", "AffiliationID": "60030612, 60079887", "AffiliationName": "VA San Diego Healthcare System and Center for AIDS Research, University of California San Diego"}, "23483229100": {"Name": "Vitiello P.", "AuthorID": "23483229100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60023925", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital, London and The Royal Liverpool Hospital"}, "6701726336": {"Name": "Mackie N.", "AuthorID": "6701726336", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "St Mary's Hospital"}, "55319142500": {"Name": "Ainsworth J.", "AuthorID": "55319142500", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex Hospital"}, "7101758836": {"Name": "Waters A.", "AuthorID": "7101758836", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex Hospital"}, "7005967261": {"Name": "Post F.", "AuthorID": "7005967261", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "35581226900": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "35581226900", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "St Thomas' Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
