Examination of this approximation leads to the new results that the TRPMD force on the centroid is identical to the Matinfara force on the centroid, and that (in a harmonic potential) the friction matrix can be chosen to produce either the correct oscillation frequency of the higher ring-polymer normal modes or the correct maximum in their position spectrum. This is illustrated with the position-squared autocorrelation function where TRPMD improves upon other similar methods. However, no physical choice of friction resolves qualitatively incorrect fluctuation dynamics at barriers. These results are broadly consistent with previous numerical studies and advise the use of TRPMD for spectra.", "AuthorKeywords": ["correlation function", "Langevin dynamics", "path integral", "Quantum dynamics", "ring polymer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Correlation function", "Langevin dynamics", "Path integral", "Quantum dynamics", "Ring polymers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955117494", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55619838400": {"Name": "Hele T.", "AuthorID": "55619838400", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Baker Laboratory, Cornell University"}}}
