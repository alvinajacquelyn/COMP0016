The aim of this randomized, controlled study was to compare the short-term clinical outcomes of the two design rationales. A total of 105 knees were randomized to receive either a single radius (Scorpio, Stryker; SR Group) or multiple radius (AGC, Zimmer Biomet; MR group) TKR. Patient-reported outcomes (Oxford Knee Score [OKS] and Knee Society Score [KSS]) were collected at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year following surgery. No knees were revised. There was no difference in primary outcomes: OKS was 39.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36.9-42.1) in the SR group and 38.1 (95% CI: 36.0-40.3) in the MR group (p = 0.40). KSS was 168.4 (95% CI: 159.8-177.0) in the SR group; 159.5 (95% CI 150.5-168.5) in the MR group (p = 0.16). There was a small but statistically significant difference in the degree of change of the objective subscale of the KSS, favoring the SR design (p = 0.04), but this is of uncertain clinical relevance. The reported benefits of SR designs do not provide demonstrable functional advantages in the short term.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multiple-radius", "patient-reported outcome", "single-radius", "total knee replacement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019045365", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55654008000": {"Name": "Mushtaq N.", "AuthorID": "55654008000", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "36840164900": {"Name": "Liddle A.D.", "AuthorID": "36840164900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "16637007600": {"Name": "Isaac D.", "AuthorID": "16637007600", "AffiliationID": "60010647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Torbay Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8731983100": {"Name": "Dillow K.", "AuthorID": "8731983100", "AffiliationID": "60001417", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust"}, "36724830000": {"Name": "Gill P.", "AuthorID": "36724830000", "AffiliationID": "109078047", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Princess Royal University Hospital"}}}
