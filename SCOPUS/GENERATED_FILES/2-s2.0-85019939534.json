Motivated by the impressive experimental advances in the area of ultracold atomic mixtures, we theoretically study the problem of ultracold atomic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate mixture (BEC). The coupling between impurity and BEC gives rise to the formation of polarons whose mutual interaction can be effectively tuned using an external laser driving a quasi-resonant Raman transition between the BEC components. Our scheme allows one to change the effective interactions between polarons in different sites from attractive to zero. This is achieved by simply changing the intensity and the frequency of the two lasers. Such arrangement opens new avenues for the study of strongly correlated condensed matter models in ultracold gases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019939534", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56670375500": {"Name": "Compagno E.", "AuthorID": "56670375500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London United Kingdom"}, "8981313800": {"Name": "De Chiara G.", "AuthorID": "8981313800", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Queen's University"}, "8153853700": {"Name": "Angelakis D.", "AuthorID": "8153853700", "AffiliationID": "60095887, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore Singapore"}, "7005868408": {"Name": "Palma G.", "AuthorID": "7005868408", "AffiliationID": "60017697, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "NEST-INFM (CNR) and Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Palermo"}}}
