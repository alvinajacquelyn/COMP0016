To investigate whether a molecular favourable-risk genotype can be identified, we investigated CEBPA, NPM1 and FLT3 status and prognostic impact in a cohort of 301 patients aged 60 years or more with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, all treated intensively. Overall survival (OS) at 1 year was highest in the 12 patients (4%) that were CEBPADM compared to the 76 (28%) with a mutant NPM1 and wild-type FLT3 (NPM1MUTFLT3WT) genotype or all other patients (75%, 54%, 33% respectively), with median survival 15\u00b72, 13\u00b76 and 6\u00b76 months, although the benefit was short-term (OS at 3 years 17%, 29%, 12% respectively). Combination of the CEBPADM and NPM1MUTFLT3WT genotype patients defined a molecular group with favourable prognosis (P < 0\u00b70001 in multivariate analysis), with 57% of patients alive at 1 year compared to 33% for all other patients. Knowledge of genotype in older cytogenetically intermediate-risk patients might influence therapy decisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute myeloid leukaemia", "CEBPA genotype", "Molecular prognostication", "NPM1 and FLT3 genotype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins", "Female", "fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3", "Genotype", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Prognosis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956891297", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"57210095645": {"Name": "Dickson G.J.", "AuthorID": "57210095645", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haemato-Oncology, King's College London"}, "57028459400": {"Name": "Bustraan S.", "AuthorID": "57028459400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "57218951576": {"Name": "Ali A.", "AuthorID": "57218951576", "AffiliationID": "60104697", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Northern Border University"}, "14634099500": {"Name": "Linch D.C.", "AuthorID": "14634099500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "7202817451": {"Name": "Gale R.E.", "AuthorID": "7202817451", "AffiliationID": "116308144", "AffiliationName": "CTI Life Sciences Ltd."}, "7005927424": {"Name": "Hills R.K.", "AuthorID": "7005927424", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7103199592": {"Name": "Burnett A.K.", "AuthorID": "7103199592", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "35373669600": {"Name": "Goldstone A.H.", "AuthorID": "35373669600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}}}
