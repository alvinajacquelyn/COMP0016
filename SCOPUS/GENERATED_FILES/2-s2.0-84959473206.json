The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. We attempted to characterize peripheral immune cells and their activation status in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and healthy controls. Methods and results: Twenty people with TLE and 19 controls were recruited, and peripheral blood lymphocyte and monocyte subsets evaluated ex vivo by multi-color flow cytometry. People with TLE had higher expression of HLA-DR, CD69, CTLA-4, CD25, IL-23R, IFN-\u03b3, TNF and IL-17 in CD4+ lymphocytes than controls. Granzyme A, CTLA-4, IL-23R and IL-17 expression was also elevated in CD8+ T cells from people with TLE. Frequency of HLA-DR in CD19+ B cells and regulatory T cells CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ producing IL-10 was higher in TLE when compared with controls. A negative correlation between CD4+ expressing co-stimulatory molecules (CD69, CD25 and CTLA-4) with age at onset of seizures was found. The frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells was also positively correlated with age at onset of seizures. Conclusion: Immune cells of people with TLE show an activation profile, mainly in effector T cells, in line with the low-grade peripheral inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell activation", "Cytokines", "Human temporal lobe epilepsy", "Immunophenotyping", "Lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Interleukin-10", "Interleukin-17", "Leukocytes", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959473206", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"26868252700": {"Name": "Vieira \u00c9.L.M.", "AuthorID": "26868252700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences"}, "56085845600": {"Name": "Lessa J.M.K.", "AuthorID": "56085845600", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Division, Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "56085383100": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves A.P.", "AuthorID": "56085383100", "AffiliationID": "60061718", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Treatment Advanced Centre (NATE), Fel\u00edcio Rocho Hospital"}, "57206700110": {"Name": "Oliveira A.C.P.", "AuthorID": "57206700110", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Division, Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "55871338800": {"Name": "Teixeira A.L.", "AuthorID": "55871338800", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Division, Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "24467265500": {"Name": "de Oliveira G.N.M.", "AuthorID": "24467265500", "AffiliationID": "60103782, 60013918", "AffiliationName": "Medicine School, Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri (UFVJM)"}, "7401779010": {"Name": "Bauer M.E.", "AuthorID": "7401779010", "AffiliationID": "60015760", "AffiliationName": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Imunologia do Envelhecimento, Instituto de Pesquisas Biom\u00e9dicas, PUCRS"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society"}, "35478909000": {"Name": "Cendes F.", "AuthorID": "35478909000", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, UNICAMP"}}}
