Here, we introduce an all-optical PIT multi-channel switching based on the metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM) plasmonic waveguide device with small footprint. Single/double PIT is investigated both theoretically and numerically by multi-oscillator theory (MOT) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), and utilizing the nonlinear medium filled in the cavity, the PIT can be dynamically tunable to achieve various kinds of single/multi-channel switching for telecommunication wavelengths. Besides, utilizing the unprecedented high Kerr coefficient of graphene, the low-power and ultrafast all-optical switching can be made possible. This work provides a novel scheme to realize all-optical switching based on PIT, which can promote on-chip ultrafast optical communication and signal processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graphene", "Nonlinear", "Plasmon-induced transparency", "Switching"], "IndexKeywords": ["All-optical switching", "Electromagnetically-induced transparency", "Finite -difference time domains (FDTD)", "Induced transparency", "Nonlinear", "Plasmonic waveguides", "Telecommunication wavelengths", "Ultrafast all-optical switching"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047245260", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56518336500": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56518336500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56732089500": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56732089500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57202129877": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "57202129877", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55491491300": {"Name": "He X.", "AuthorID": "55491491300", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57192831289": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "57192831289", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}}}
