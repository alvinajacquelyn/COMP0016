Studies using advanced MS have resulted in new insights into cell biology and the etiology of diseases as well as its use in clinical applications. Areas covered: This review discusses recent developments in MS-based technologies and their cancer-related applications with a focus on proteomics. It also discusses the issues around translating the research findings to the clinic and provides an outline of where the field is moving. Expert commentary: Proteomics has been problematic to adapt for the clinical setting. However, MS-based techniques continue to demonstrate potential in novel clinical uses beyond classical cancer proteomics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biotyping", "cancer proteomics", "cancer research", "clinical diagnostics", "clinical mass spectrometry", "MALDI", "Mass spectrometry", "mass spectrometry imaging", "pharmacokinetics", "REIMS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasms", "Proteomics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965050351", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"7004011904": {"Name": "Timms J.", "AuthorID": "7004011904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57189072823": {"Name": "Hale O.", "AuthorID": "57189072823", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading"}, "7102501366": {"Name": "Cramer R.", "AuthorID": "7102501366", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading"}}}
