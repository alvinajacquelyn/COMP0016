With the recent development of high-speed OCT systems and efficient algorithms, OCTA has become clinically feasible. In this review article, we discuss the technical principles of OCTA, including image processing and artifacts, and its clinical applications in ophthalmology. We summarize recent studies which qualitatively or quantitatively assess disease presentation, progression, and/or response to treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choroidal neovascularization", "diabetic retinopathy", "glaucoma", "optic disc", "optical coherence tomography angiography", "retina"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029915562", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57195265940": {"Name": "Hagag A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195265940", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "56537382800": {"Name": "Gao S.S.", "AuthorID": "56537382800", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "7401503784": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401503784", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "35310666200": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "35310666200", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University"}}}
