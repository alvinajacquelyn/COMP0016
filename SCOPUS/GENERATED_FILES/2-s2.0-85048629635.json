Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.We study hyperelliptic curves C with an action of an affine group of automorphisms G. We establish a closed form expression for the quotient curve C/G and for the first \u00e9tale cohomology group of C as a representation of G. The motivation comes from the arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves over local fields, specifically their local Galois representations and the associated invariants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048629635", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"16066841100": {"Name": "Dokchitser T.", "AuthorID": "16066841100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "23476859300": {"Name": "Dokchitser V.", "AuthorID": "23476859300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}}}
