At the high glutamate concentrations typically seen during synaptic transmission, TARPs slow receptor desensitization and enhance mean channel conductance. However, their influence on channels gated by low glutamate concentrations, as encountered during delayed transmitter clearance or synaptic spillover, is poorly understood. We report here that TARP \u03b3-2 reduces the ability of low glutamate concentrations to cause AMPAR desensitization and enhances channel gating at low glutamate occupancy. Simulations show that, by shifting the balance between AMPAR activation and desensitization, TARPs can markedly facilitate the transduction of spillover-mediated synaptic signaling. Furthermore, the dual effects of TARPs can account for biphasic steady-state glutamate concentration-response curves\u2014a phenomenon termed \u201cautoinactivation,\u201d previously thought to reflect desensitization-mediated AMPAR/TARP dissociation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebellar granule cell", "diffusion model", "EPSC", "GluA1", "kinetic model", "short-term plasticity", "single-channel", "spillover", "subconductance", "synaptic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium Channels", "Glutamic Acid", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Receptors, AMPA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026859419", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"23011240300": {"Name": "Coombs I.", "AuthorID": "23011240300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7003981084": {"Name": "Farrant M.", "AuthorID": "7003981084", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7007178998": {"Name": "Cull-Candy S.", "AuthorID": "7007178998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56265648200": {"Name": "MacLean D.", "AuthorID": "56265648200", "AffiliationID": "60024746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, University of Rochester Medical Center"}, "7102274326": {"Name": "Jayaraman V.", "AuthorID": "7102274326", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Center for Membrane Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"}}}
