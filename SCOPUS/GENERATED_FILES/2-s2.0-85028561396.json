Here we show that this distributed intermolecular force-field (DIFF) models the experimental crystal structures as accurately as modelling all but the electrostatic term with an isotropic repulsion-dispersion potential that has been fitted to experimental crystal structures. In both cases, the differences are comparable to the changes in the crystal structure with temperature, pressure, or neglect of zero-point vibrational effects. A crystal structure prediction study has been carried out, and the observed polymorphs contrasted with hypothetical thermodynamically competitive crystal structures. The DIFF model was able to identify the structure of an unreported high pressure phase of pyridine, unlike the empirically fitted potential. The DIFF model approach therefore provides a model of the underlying pair potential energy surface that we have transferred to the crystalline phase with a considerable degree of success, though the treatment of the many-body terms needs improvement and the pair potential is slightly over-binding. Furthermore, this study of a system that exhibits isotopic polymorphism highlights that the use of an empirical potential has partially absorbed temperature and zero-point motion effects as well as the intermolecular forces not explicitly represented in the functional form. This study therefore highlights the complexity in modelling crystallization phenomena from a realistic pair potential energy surface.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystal structure prediction", "Crystalline phase", "Dispersion coefficient", "Empirical potentials", "High-pressure phase", "Inter-molecular forces", "Symmetry adapted perturbation theory", "Vibrational effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028561396", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57195511888": {"Name": "Aina A.A.", "AuthorID": "57195511888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202475468": {"Name": "Price S.L.", "AuthorID": "7202475468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "11440186900": {"Name": "Misquitta A.J.", "AuthorID": "11440186900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary, University of London"}}}
