The disease progression varies from patient to patient due to a range of different factors. In this paper, a mathematical model will be used to understand neointimal hyperplasia in individual patients, combining information from biological experiments and patient-specific data to analyze some aspects of the disease, particularly with regard to mechanical stimuli due to shear stresses on the vessel wall. By combining a biochemical model of cell growth and a patient-specific computational fluid dynamics analysis of blood flow in the lumen, remodeling of the blood vessel is studied by means of a novel computational framework. The framework was used to analyze two vein graft bypasses from one patient: a femoro-popliteal and a femoro-distal bypass. The remodeling of the vessel wall and analysis of the flow for each case was then compared to clinical data and discussed as a potential tool for a better understanding of the disease. Simulation results from this first computational approach showed an overall agreement on the locations of hyperplasia in these patients and demonstrated the potential of using new integrative modeling tools to understand disease progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational fluid dynamics", "Multi-scale modeling", "Neointimal hyperplasia", "Remodeling", "Shear stress", "Vein grafts"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018757340", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57194111229": {"Name": "Donadoni F.", "AuthorID": "57194111229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8241424500": {"Name": "Pichardo-Almarza C.", "AuthorID": "8241424500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194110838": {"Name": "Bartlett M.", "AuthorID": "57194110838", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University of Warwick"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "D\u00edaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003537020": {"Name": "Dardik A.", "AuthorID": "7003537020", "AffiliationID": "60105857", "AffiliationName": "Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System"}}}
