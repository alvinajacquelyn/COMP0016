KGaA, Weinheim Zinc is a biocompatible element that exists as the second most abundant transition metal ion and an indispensable trace element in the human body. Compared to traditional metal-organic complexes systems, d 10 metal Zn II complexes not only exhibit a large Stokes shift and good photon stability but also possess strong emission and low cytotoxicity with a relatively small molecular weight. The use of Zn II complexes has emerged in the last decade as a versatile and convenient tool for numerous biological applications, including bioimaging, molecular and protein recognition, as well as photodynamic therapy. Herein, we review recent developments involving Zn II metal complexes applied as specific subcellular compartment imaging probes and their correlated utilizations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["functional imaging", "intracellular targeting", "photodynamic therapy", "Zinc-complexes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological applications", "Functional imaging", "Intracellular targeting", "Low cytotoxicities", "Metal-organic complexes", "Protein recognition", "Subcellular compartments", "Zinc complex", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Contrast Media", "Coordination Complexes", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Intracellular Membranes", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061104715", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"40561700700": {"Name": "Tian X.", "AuthorID": "40561700700", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "School of life science, Anhui University"}, "57203423084": {"Name": "Hussain S.", "AuthorID": "57203423084", "AffiliationID": "112198310", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Sciences and Humanities (NUSASH), National University of Technology, Sector I-12"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57205682648": {"Name": "de Pace C.", "AuthorID": "57205682648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "15063332400": {"Name": "Ruiz-P\u00e9rez L.", "AuthorID": "15063332400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
