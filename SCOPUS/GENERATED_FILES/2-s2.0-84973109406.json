Empirical evidence is provided that value formation is not only associated with value co-creation, but also with value co-destruction. The case study showed that a mature and synergistic network relationship (that successfully aligned the expectations of a strong key account management team (KAM team), multi-headed customer and wider project stakeholders) could, if not well managed, turn into incongruent relationships, relationship uncoupling and resource withdrawal. These findings suggest that project managers must drive strong KAM team relationships, so that they can align and adapt to customer requirements, and control the response to often changing wider stakeholder expectations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-creation", "expectations", "key account management", "relationships", "stakeholders", "value"], "IndexKeywords": ["Co-creation", "expectations", "Key account management", "relationships", "stakeholders", "value"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973109406", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"7201923283": {"Name": "Mills G.R.W.", "AuthorID": "7201923283", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56548961500": {"Name": "Razmdoost K.", "AuthorID": "56548961500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
