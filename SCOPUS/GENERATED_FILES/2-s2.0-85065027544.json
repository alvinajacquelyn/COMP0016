Methods: Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 5861). Linear regression models tested associations between (i) concessionary bus pass (CBP) ownership and (ii) frequency of CBP use and three measures of wellbeing (quality of life, life satisfaction, depressive symptoms), adjusting for age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status and limiting long-standing illness. Mediation analyses tested the role of (i) social isolation and (ii) physical activity in each association between CBP ownership/use and wellbeing. Results: Ownership and use of a CBP was significantly associated with better quality of life (both p < 0.001), higher life satisfaction (both p < 0.01) and fewer depressive symptoms (both p < 0.01). Mediation models revealed significant indirect associations of CBP ownership (all p < 0.001) and use (all p < 0.05) via social isolation on wellbeing. There were also significant indirect associations of CBP ownership (all p < 0.01) and use (all p < 0.001) via physical activity on wellbeing. Social isolation explained 7.7\u201320.1% of the total association between free bus travel and wellbeing, and physical activity explained 9.0\u201317.4%. Conclusions: Ownership and use of a CBP are associated with better quality of life, higher life satisfaction, and fewer depressive symptoms in older adults in England. Associations between free bus travel and wellbeing are partly explained by an increase in physical activity and a reduction in social isolation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bus travel", "Depression", "Older adults", "Physical activity", "Public health", "Public transport", "Quality of life", "Social isolation", "Wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065027544", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56506646300": {"Name": "Firth J.A.", "AuthorID": "56506646300", "AffiliationID": "60021955, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Merton College, University of Oxford"}, "56503241000": {"Name": "Firth J.", "AuthorID": "56503241000", "AffiliationID": "60118837, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Youth Mental Health, University of Melbourne"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60018618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Care, Orthogeriatrics and Rheabilitation, E.O.
