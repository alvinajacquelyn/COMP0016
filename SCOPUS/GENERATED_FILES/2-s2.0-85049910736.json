Soft robots, which are widely recognized as the next generation of human-friendly robots, are such a trend. Soft robots are generally more adaptable, more flexible, and safer than their rigid-link counterparts. Research in soft robotics has produced a broad variety of interesting solutions for all sorts of applications ranging from medical engineering and rehabilitation over exploration to industrial handling. This diversity together with a general lack of experience in designing with soft materials has contributed to a design flow that is highly empirical in nature. For soft robots to become mass-producible in the near future, more general design and modeling methods are needed. In this article, we present a method for the design optimization of soft robot modules that effectively combines finite element modeling and gradient-free optimization. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a soft pneumatic actuator is designed and optimized. Performance analysis of the optimization scheme shows the robustness of the solution in the given case.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bio-inspired robotics", "Design optimization", "General designs", "Gradient-free optimizations", "Human-Friendly Robots", "Medical engineering", "Optimization scheme", "Performance analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049910736", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"55486407100": {"Name": "Runge G.", "AuthorID": "55486407100", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Assembly Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "57202942676": {"Name": "Peters J.", "AuthorID": "57202942676", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Assembly Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "6506437925": {"Name": "Raatz A.", "AuthorID": "6506437925", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Assembly Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}}}
