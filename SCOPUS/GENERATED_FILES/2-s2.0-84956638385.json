We argue, however, that this hypothesis provides an overly simplified picture due to its inability to account for relevance. We manipulated relevance in the evaluation of the probability and acceptability of indicative conditionals and found that relevance moderates the effect of P(C|A). This corroborates the Default and Penalty Hypothesis put forward in this paper. Finally, the probability and acceptability of concessive conditionals (\"Even if A, then still C\") were investigated and it was found that the Equation provides a better account of concessive conditionals than of indicatives across relevance manipulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concessive conditionals", "Indicative conditionals", "Reasons", "Relevance", "The Equation", "The New Paradigm"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Judgment", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Problem Solving", "Random Allocation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956638385", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56734446400": {"Name": "Skovgaard-Olsen N.", "AuthorID": "56734446400", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "7006445400": {"Name": "Klauer K.", "AuthorID": "7006445400", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Z\u00fcrich"}}}
