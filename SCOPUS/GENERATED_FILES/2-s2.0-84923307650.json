Despite significant advances in understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis and natural history of myopic CNV, there is no standard definition of myopic CNV and its relationship to axial length and other myopic degenerative changes. Several treatments are available to ophthalmologists, but with the advent of new therapies there is a need for further consensus and clinical management recommendations. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy has been an established treatment for subfoveal myopic CNV for many years, but this treatment does not restore visual acuity and is associated with long-term chorioretinal atrophy. More recently, clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents in patients with myopic CNV have demonstrated substantial visual acuity gains and quality of life increases compared with photodynamic therapy. These enhanced outcomes provide updated evidence-based clinical management guidelines of myopic CNV, and increase the need for a generally accepted definition for myopic CNV. This review critically summarises the latest myopic CNV literature in the context of clinical experience and recommends a myopic CNV treatment algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Choroidal Neovascularization", "Decision Support Techniques", "Humans", "Laser Coagulation", "Myopia, Degenerative", "Photochemotherapy", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923307650", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7403147159": {"Name": "Wong T.Y.", "AuthorID": "7403147159", "AffiliationID": "60017161, 60008970, 60024285", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre, National University of Singapore"}, "7003458924": {"Name": "Ohno-Matsui K.", "AuthorID": "7003458924", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University"}, "35321211600": {"Name": "Leveziel N.", "AuthorID": "35321211600", "AffiliationID": "106971553", "AffiliationName": "Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine de Poitiers, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "57201820304": {"Name": "Holz F.G.", "AuthorID": "57201820304", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "7202203581": {"Name": "Lai T.Y.", "AuthorID": "7202203581", "AffiliationID": "60002798, 60014411", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Hong Kong Eye Hospital, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "56589187000": {"Name": "Yu H.G.", "AuthorID": "56589187000", "AffiliationID": "60000656", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine"}, "57202570679": {"Name": "Lanzetta P.", "AuthorID": "57202570679", "AffiliationID": "60025965, 60009513", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Udine, Piazzale S.
