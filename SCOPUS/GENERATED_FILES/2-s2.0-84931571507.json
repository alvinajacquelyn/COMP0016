Although the effects of VZV reactivation are observed in the skin (shingles), the number and functional capacity of cutaneous VZV-specific T cells have not been investigated. The numbers of circulating IFN-\u03b3-secreting VZV-specific CD4 + T cells are significantly decreased in old subjects. However, other measures of VZV-specific CD4 + T cells, including proliferative capacity to VZV antigen stimulation and identification of VZV-specific CD4 + T cells with an major histocompatibility complex class II tetramer (epitope of IE-63 protein), were similar in both age groups. The majority of T cells in the skin of both age groups expressed CD69, a characteristic of skin-resident T cells. VZV-specific CD4 + T cells were significantly increased in the skin compared with the blood in young and old subjects, and their function was similar in both age groups. In contrast, the number of Foxp3 + regulatory T cells and expression of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death -1 PD-1 on CD4 + T cells were significantly increased in the skin of older humans. Therefore, VZV-specific CD4 + T cells in the skin of older individuals are functionally competent. However, their activity may be restricted by multiple inhibitory influences in situ.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Biopsy, Needle", "Case-Control Studies", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cells, Cultured", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Herpes Zoster", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reference Values", "Skin", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Virus Activation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931571507", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6507455433": {"Name": "Vukmanovic-Stejic M.", "AuthorID": "6507455433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55565965500": {"Name": "Sandhu D.", "AuthorID": "55565965500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57190371519": {"Name": "Seidel J.A.", "AuthorID": "57190371519", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57198804168": {"Name": "Patel N.", "AuthorID": "57198804168", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "25822759900": {"Name": "Sobande T.O.", "AuthorID": "25822759900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "8552097800": {"Name": "Agius E.", "AuthorID": "8552097800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57196323283": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323283", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.N.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006463634": {"Name": "Rustin M.H.A.", "AuthorID": "7006463634", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "14017956800": {"Name": "Fuentes-Duculan J.", "AuthorID": "14017956800", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University"}, "10140242800": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Fari\u00f1as M.", "AuthorID": "10140242800", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University"}, "7201666842": {"Name": "Krueger J.G.", "AuthorID": "7201666842", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University"}, "7003655701": {"Name": "Mabbott N.A.", "AuthorID": "7003655701", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick), School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"}, "14043601600": {"Name": "Lacy K.E.", "AuthorID": "14043601600", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803", "AffiliationName": "St Johns Institute of Dermatology, Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7005117051": {"Name": "Nestle F.O.", "AuthorID": "7005117051", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803", "AffiliationName": "St Johns Institute of Dermatology, Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7004817817": {"Name": "Ogg G.", "AuthorID": "7004817817", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Immunology Unit, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford"}}}
