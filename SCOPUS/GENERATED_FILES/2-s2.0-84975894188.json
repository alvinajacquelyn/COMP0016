Here, starting from a promising lead, a small series of novel hydrazone-based compounds were synthesized and evaluated as G-quadruplex binders. The in vitro G-quadruplex-binding properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated employing both human telomeric and oncogene promoter G-quadruplexes with different folding topologies as targets. The present investigation led to the identification of potent G-quadruplex stabilizers with high selectivity over duplex DNA and preference for one G-quadruplex topology over others. Among them, selected derivatives have been shown to trap G-quadruplex structures in the nucleus of cancer cells. Interestingly, this behavior correlates with efficient cytotoxic activity in human osteosarcoma and colon carcinoma cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Proliferation", "DNA", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "G-Quadruplexes", "Humans", "Hydrazones", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Structure", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975894188", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"8918952000": {"Name": "Amato J.", "AuthorID": "8918952000", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "9434649100": {"Name": "Pagano B.", "AuthorID": "9434649100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "57189060233": {"Name": "Pagano A.", "AuthorID": "57189060233", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "7005912361": {"Name": "Novellino E.", "AuthorID": "7005912361", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "23036454300": {"Name": "Randazzo A.", "AuthorID": "23036454300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "6603627752": {"Name": "Morigi R.", "AuthorID": "6603627752", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "57189901297": {"Name": "De Magis A.", "AuthorID": "57189901297", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "55576514500": {"Name": "Tiang Y.", "AuthorID": "55576514500", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "7007057112": {"Name": "Capranico G.", "AuthorID": "7007057112", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "7103338579": {"Name": "Locatelli A.", "AuthorID": "7103338579", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "56905463500": {"Name": "Graziadio A.", "AuthorID": "56905463500", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "7005963196": {"Name": "Leoni A.", "AuthorID": "7005963196", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "56984167800": {"Name": "Rambaldi M.", "AuthorID": "56984167800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"}, "6506607447": {"Name": "Ohnmacht S.", "AuthorID": "6506607447", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
