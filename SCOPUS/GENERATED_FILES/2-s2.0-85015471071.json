All rights reserved.Background: Chromogranin A (CgA) is the best established neuroendocrine biomarker. This study was aimed at investigating the prognostic value of CgA as a predictor of radiological disease progression in neuroendocrine tumour (NET) patients. Methods: Patients with metastatic NETs and evidence of radiological progression (RP) according to RECIST 1.1 were identified from a NET database. Plasma CgA levels were measured 6 and 12 months before RP and at the event of RP. CgA was measured with the Supra-regional-Assay-Service radioimmunoassay (Hammersmith Hospital). Results: A total of 152 patients were evaluated including 91 midgut NETs and 61 pancreatic NETs (PNETs). Of these, 56 were G1 NETs, 65 G2, 10 G3, 21 of unknown histology. For all NETs, there was a positive trend in terms of increase of CgA values 6 months prior to RP compared to 12 months before RP. Subgroup analysis at first episode of RP showed that for PNETs there was evidence of a difference in the median CgA levels. CgA 6 months before RP was 100 pmol/L [interquartile 1 (Q1) =53 and Q3 =286.25 pmol/L) and 12 months before was 52 pmol/L (Q1 =36.25 and Q3 =128 pmol/L), W=52, P=0.48. This observation was not confirmed in midgut NETs, where median CgA 6 months before RP was 389.5 pmol/L (Q1 =131.5 and Q3 =791.5 pmol/L) and 12 months before was 319 pmol/L (Q1 =158 and Q3 =753 pmol/L), W=191, P=0.39]. Low grade tumours (G1) had a median CgA value at 6 months significantly higher than at 12 months [181 (Q1 =56.25, Q3 =624) vs. 149.5 (Q1 =44, Q3 =247.25) pmol/L, W=70, P=0.48]. Conclusions: CgA seems to have predictive value 6 months prior to RP for PNETs and G1 tumours. Further prospective analyses are needed to enable more definitive conclusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromogranin A (CgA)", "Neuroendocrine tumour (NET)", "Prognosis", "Radiological disease progression", "Tumour markers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015471071", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55198585100": {"Name": "Rossi R.E.", "AuthorID": "55198585100", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60007067", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "56370848000": {"Name": "Garcia-Hernandez J.", "AuthorID": "56370848000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.E.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57199899475": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "57199899475", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6603079245": {"Name": "Thirlwell C.", "AuthorID": "6603079245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7402110302": {"Name": "Watkins J.", "AuthorID": "7402110302", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56963259100": {"Name": "Martin N.G.", "AuthorID": "56963259100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
