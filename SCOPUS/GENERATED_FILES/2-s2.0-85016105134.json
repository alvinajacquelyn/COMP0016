Confusingly, for a neurologic readership, these disorders of function may often be due to a urologic, gynecologic, or neurologic cause. However, there is a subset of functional urologic disorders where the cause remains uncertain and, in this chapter, we describe the clinical features of these disorders in turn: psychogenic urinary retention; Fowler's syndrome; paruresis (shy-bladder syndrome); dysfunctional voiding; idiopathic overactive bladder, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Some of these overlap in terms of symptoms, but have become historically separated. Psychogenic urinary retention in particular has now largely been abandoned as a concept, in part because of the finding of specific urethral electromyogram findings in patients with this symptom now described as having Fowler's syndrome, and their successful treatment with sacral neurostimulation. In this chapter we review the poorly researched interface between these \u201cidiopathic\u201d functional urologic disorders and other functional disorders (e.g., irritable-bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia) as well as specifically functional neurologic disorders. We conclude that there may be a relationship and overlap between them and that this requires further research, especially in those idiopathic functional urologic disorders which involve disorders of the urethral sphincter (i.e., voluntary muscle).", "AuthorKeywords": ["dysfunctional voiding", "Fowler's syndrome", "functional neurologic disorders", "functional urologic disorders", "interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome", "lower urinary tract dysfunction", "opiate", "overactive bladder", "paruresis", "psychogenic", "psychogenic urinary retention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Psychophysiologic Disorders", "Urologic Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016105134", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55232441100": {"Name": "Hoeritzauer I.", "AuthorID": "55232441100", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "24169682200": {"Name": "Ph\u00e9 V.", "AuthorID": "24169682200", "AffiliationID": "60015622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK and Department of Urology, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Academic Hospital"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
