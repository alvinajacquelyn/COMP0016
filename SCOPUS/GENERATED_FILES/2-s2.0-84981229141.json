This paper observes the definitional deficiencies in this understanding, and reanalyses constructive trusts in terms of the rights which they give effect to. This understanding reveals that English law sets its face against the exercise of discretion in relation only to some remedial constructive trusts and not others, and that the perceived difficulties with remedial constructive trusts are often exaggerated. It ends by noting some crucial implications of the re-analysis for the future development of the law.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Australia", "Canada", "discretion", "institutional constructive trusts", "primary and secondary rights precedent", "remedial constructive trusts", "retrospectivity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981229141", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"56150993800": {"Name": "Liew Y.", "AuthorID": "56150993800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
