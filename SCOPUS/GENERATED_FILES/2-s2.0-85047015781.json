Ps lifetimes in the pore structures were measured directly via time-delayed laser excitation of 13S1\u219223PJ transitions. In a film containing 5-nm pores Ps was predominantly emitted into vacuum, with a small component of confined Ps with a lifetime of 75 ns also observed. In films with larger pores Ps atoms were not emitted into vacuum except from the film surface, and confined Ps lifetimes of \u224890 ns were measured with no dependence on the pore size. However, for such large pores, extended Tao-Eldrup (ETE)-type models predict Ps lifetimes close to the 142-ns vacuum value. Moreover, 13S1\u219223PJ excitation of Ps atoms inside the pores was found to result in annihilation and exhibited an extremely broad (\u224810 THz) linewidth. We attribute these observations to a process in which nonthermal Ps atoms in the isolated voids become temporarily trapped in a series of surface states that dissociate following excitation. The occurrence of this mechanism is not necessarily apparent from ground-state Ps decay rates without some prior knowledge of the sample structure, and it precludes the application of ETE-type models as they do not take into account surface interactions other than pickoff annihilation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Film surfaces", "Porous silica films", "Positronium atom", "Prior knowledge", "Sample structure", "Small components", "Surface interactions", "Time delayed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047015781", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56662765500": {"Name": "Cooper B.", "AuthorID": "56662765500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57205068737": {"Name": "Gurung L.", "AuthorID": "57205068737", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54790549500": {"Name": "Cassidy D.", "AuthorID": "54790549500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006102383": {"Name": "Boilot J.", "AuthorID": "7006102383", "AffiliationID": "60021525, 60013425", "AffiliationName": "Groupe de Chimie du Solide, Laboratoire de Physique de la Mati\u00e8re Condens\u00e9e, UMR CNRS 7643, Ecole Polytechnique"}, "36061606600": {"Name": "Guillemot F.", "AuthorID": "36061606600", "AffiliationID": "60008758", "AffiliationName": "Saint-Gobain Recherche"}, "7005866199": {"Name": "Corbel C.", "AuthorID": "7005866199", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106133, 60103052, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "DRF, IRFU, IRAMIS, CEA, University Paris-Saclay"}, "24391158800": {"Name": "Liszkay L.", "AuthorID": "24391158800", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106133, 60103052, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "DRF, IRFU, IRAMIS, CEA, University Paris-Saclay"}}}
