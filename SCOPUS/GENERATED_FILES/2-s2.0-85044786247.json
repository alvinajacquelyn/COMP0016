Despite a proliferation of methods for the synthesis of qualitative research, less attention has focused on how to integrate these syntheses within intervention effectiveness reviews. In this article, we report updated guidance from the group on approaches, methods, and tools, which can be used to integrate the findings from quantitative studies evaluating intervention effectiveness with those from qualitative studies and process evaluations. We draw on conceptual analyses of mixed methods systematic review designs and the range of methods and tools that have been used in published reviews that have successfully integrated different types of evidence. We outline five key methods and tools as devices for integration which vary in terms of the levels at which integration takes place; the specialist skills and expertise required within the review team; and their appropriateness in the context of limited evidence. In situations where the requirement is the integration of qualitative and process evidence within intervention effectiveness reviews, we recommend the use of a sequential approach. Here, evidence from each tradition is synthesized separately using methods consistent with each tradition before integration takes place using a common framework. Reviews which integrate qualitative and process evaluation evidence alongside quantitative evidence on intervention effectiveness in a systematic way are rare. This guidance aims to support review teams to achieve integration and we encourage further development through reflection and formal testing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cochrane collaboration", "Implementation research", "Mixed methods research", "Process evaluations", "Qualitative evidence synthesis", "Qualitative research", "Systematic reviews"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Delivery of Health Care", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Qualitative Research", "Systematic Reviews as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044786247", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"7005196568": {"Name": "Harden A.", "AuthorID": "7005196568", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health and Human Development, The University of East London, Stratford Campus, Water Lane"}, "55574208406": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208406", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6603037904": {"Name": "Cargo M.", "AuthorID": "6603037904", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Spatial Epidemiology & Evaluation Research Group, Centre for Population Health University of South Australia"}, "55474573900": {"Name": "Harris J.", "AuthorID": "55474573900", "AffiliationID": "60176589", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield Regent Court"}, "7201728351": {"Name": "Booth A.", "AuthorID": "7201728351", "AffiliationID": "60176589", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield Regent Court"}, "16639001000": {"Name": "Pantoja T.", "AuthorID": "16639001000", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Centro M\u00e9dico San Joaqu\u00edn"}, "14011917200": {"Name": "Flemming K.", "AuthorID": "14011917200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of York"}, "7003819360": {"Name": "Garside R.", "AuthorID": "7003819360", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60028495", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment & Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School, Knowledge Spa, Royal Cornwall Hospital"}, "55881625400": {"Name": "Hannes K.", "AuthorID": "55881625400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Social Research Methodology Group, Centre for Sociological Research, Faculty of Social Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "57203175703": {"Name": "Noyes J.", "AuthorID": "57203175703", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences, Bangor University"}}}
