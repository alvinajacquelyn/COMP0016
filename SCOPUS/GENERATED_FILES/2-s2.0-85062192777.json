Cognitive behavior therapy has been shown to be a promising treatment for managing perfectionism and its associated problems, including when being administered via the Internet, i.e., Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). In the current study, seventy-eight self-referred participants underwent ICBT after an initial eight-week wait-list period, i.e., second wave of treatment. These were randomized to receive regular support from a therapist (ICBT-support) or ICBT with support on request (ICBT-request), in an eight-week treatment of perfectionism. Assessments of perfectionism were made at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, as well as six-month follow-up, using the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, subscale Concern over Mistakes. Mixed effects models revealed large symptom reductions for both conditions; Concern over Mistakes, Cohen's d = 1.40, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.85, 1.95] for ICBT-support, and d = 1.00, 95% CI [0.51, 1.47] for ICBT-request. The effects were maintained at six-month follow-up and there were no differences between the conditions in terms of the results, opened modules, or completed exercises. A total of 28 out of 70 participants (42.4%; ICBT-support, 37.8%; ICBT-request) were classified as improved at post-treatment. Both types of ICBT may thus be beneficial in treating perfectionism, suggesting that just having the opportunity to ask for support from a therapist, when regular support is not provided, could be sufficient for many participants undergoing ICBT. However, the study was underpowered to detect differences between the conditions. The lack of a cutoff also makes it difficult to differentiate a dysfunctional from a functional population in terms of perfectionism. In addition, the study design could have affected the participants' motivational level from start, given their initial eight-week wait-list period. Recommendations for future studies include recruiting a larger sample size, a clearer cutoff for perfectionism, and the use of a non-inferiority test with a predetermined margin of change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive behavioral therapy", "Internet", "Perfectionism", "Randomized controlled trial", "Support"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062192777", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57207031452": {"Name": "Zetterberg M.", "AuthorID": "57207031452", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stockholm University"}, "6603291354": {"Name": "Carlbring P.", "AuthorID": "6603291354", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark"}, "7202645907": {"Name": "Andersson G.", "AuthorID": "7202645907", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57204568035": {"Name": "Berg M.", "AuthorID": "57204568035", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "55933429800": {"Name": "Rozental A.", "AuthorID": "55933429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
