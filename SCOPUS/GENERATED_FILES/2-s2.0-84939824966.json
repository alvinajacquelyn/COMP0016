The precise tailoring of nanopore size is a significant step toward achieving this, as it would allow for a nanopore to be tuned to a corresponding analyte. The work presented here details a methodology for selectively opening nanopores in real-time. The tunable nanopores on a quartz nanopipette platform are fabricated using the electroetching of a graphene-based membrane constructed from individual graphene nanoflakes (\u00f8 \u223c30 nm). The device design allows for in situ opening of the graphene membrane, from fully closed to fully opened (\u00f8 \u223c25 nm), a feature that has yet to be reported in the literature. The translocation of DNA is studied as the pore size is varied, allowing for subfeatures of DNA to be detected with slower DNA translocations at smaller pore sizes, and the ability to observe trends as the pore is opened. This approach opens the door to creating a device that can be target to detect specific analytes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA", "graphene", "graphene nanoflake", "nanopore", "size tuning", "translocation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced analysis", "Biological molecule", "DNA translocation", "Graphene nanoflake", "Single molecule", "Size tuning", "translocation", "Tunable nanopores", "Biosensing Techniques", "DNA", "Graphite", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Nanopores", "Nanostructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939824966", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"26028240500": {"Name": "Crick C.", "AuthorID": "26028240500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "56704756600": {"Name": "Sze J.", "AuthorID": "56704756600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "7005079107": {"Name": "Edel J.", "AuthorID": "7005079107", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "38562022600": {"Name": "Rosillo-Lopez M.", "AuthorID": "38562022600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
