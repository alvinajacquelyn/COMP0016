Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic condition of a burning sensation in the mouth, where no underlying dental or medical cause can be identified. We aimed to measure the level of opiorphin in whole unstimulated (UWS) and stimulated (SWS) saliva of patients with BMS. Materials and methods: Originally developed and validated LC-MS/MS method was used for opiorphin quantification. Samples were obtained from 29 BMS patients and 29 age- and sex-matched controls. Results: The average concentration of opiorphin in UWS and SWS in the BMS group was 8.13 \u00b1 6.45 and 5.82 \u00b1 3.59 ng/ml, respectively. Opiorphin in BMS patients\u2019 UWS was significantly higher, compared to the control group (t = 2.5898; p = 0.0122). SWS opiorphin levels were higher, but not significantly, in BMS patients than in controls. Conclusions: Our results indicate that higher quantities of salivary opiorphin in BMS may be a consequence of chronic pain, but we cannot exclude that they occur as a result of emotional and behavioral imbalances possibly associated with BMS. To our knowledge, this is the first original article measuring opiorphin in a pain disorder. Clinical relevance: Opiorphin may be a measurable biomarker for chronic pain, which could help in objectifying otherwise exclusively a subjective experience. Increased opiorphin could serve as a universal objective indicator of painful conditions. Since opiorphin may also reflect emotional and socio-relational imbalances occurring with BMS, it could as well represent a biomarker for BMS. Knowledge on opiorphin\u2019s involvement in pain pathways could contribute to developing new clinical diagnostic methods for BMS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burning mouth syndrome", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Opiorphin", "Saliva", "Spectrometry, Mass"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Burning Mouth Syndrome", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oligopeptides", "Saliva", "Salivary Proteins and Peptides", "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007162601", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"54400295300": {"Name": "Salari\u0107 I.", "AuthorID": "54400295300", "AffiliationID": "60077685, 60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Zagreb School of Dental Medicine University Hospital Dubrava"}, "57200387531": {"Name": "Sabali\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57200387531", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Craniofacial Development and Stem Cell Biology, Guy\u2019s Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "55444065200": {"Name": "Alajbeg I.", "AuthorID": "55444065200", "AffiliationID": "60077685, 60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Medicine, University of Zagreb School of Dental Medicine and University Hospital Centre Zagreb"}}}
