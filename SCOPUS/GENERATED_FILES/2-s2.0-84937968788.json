In light of these concerns, this article provides an overview of the international evidence on how to improve productive efficiency in secondary care settings. Updating and expanding upon a recent review of the literature by Hurst and Williams (2012), we set out evidence on potential interventions in the policy environment, hospital management, and operational processes. We conclude with five key lessons for policy makers and practitioners on how to improve productive efficiency within hospital settings, and identify several gaps in the existing evidence base.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cost Control", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "Economic Competition", "Efficiency, Organizational", "Europe", "Hospital Administration", "Humans", "Information Systems", "Insurance, Health, Reimbursement", "Personnel Administration, Hospital", "Policy", "Quality Assurance, Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937968788", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"36667338000": {"Name": "Rumbold B.E.", "AuthorID": "36667338000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Political Science, University College London"}, "7410178589": {"Name": "Smith J.A.", "AuthorID": "7410178589", "AffiliationID": "105715038", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Trust"}, "55222549100": {"Name": "Charlesworth A.", "AuthorID": "55222549100", "AffiliationID": "117449545", "AffiliationName": "Health Foundation"}, "7403682580": {"Name": "Clarke A.", "AuthorID": "7403682580", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Health Sciences, University of Warwick"}, "56306424700": {"Name": "Hurst J.", "AuthorID": "56306424700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
