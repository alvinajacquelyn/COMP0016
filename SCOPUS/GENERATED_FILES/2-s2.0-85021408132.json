Methods and results Seventy-two people with isolated IGT (WHO 1999 criteria) and 39 gender and age-matched healthy volunteers underwent detailed clinical and neurological assessment including quantitative sensory testing using the Neurometer device (current perception threshold measurement on four limbs at three different frequencies). Sensory nerve dysfunction was defined as at least two abnormalities on any frequencies on the upper or lower limbs. Sensory nerve dysfunction was more prevalent among subjects with IGT compared to controls (58.3 vs. 10.3%, OR: 11.23, 95%CI: 3.57\u201335.35). This association was not influenced by BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and autonomic neuropathy (multiple adjusted OR: 13.87, 95%CI: 3.18\u201360.58), but further adjustment for glycaemic measures abolished the association (OR: 1.58, 95%CI: 0.07\u201335.68). Assessing the components of glycaemic measures separately, the association between sensory nerve dysfunction and IGT was not affected by HbA1c (OR: 13.94, 95%CI: 1.84\u2013105.5). It was, however, substantially attenuated by fasting plasma glucose (OR: 6.75, 95%CI: 1.33\u201334.27) while the significance was lost after adjustment for 120 min postload glucose level (OR: 3.76, 95%CI: 0.26\u201354.10). In the pooled population assessed, independent determinants of sensory nerve dysfunction were older age, 120 min glucose, higher height and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy at near significance. Conclusions Sensory nerve dysfunction amongst subjects with IGT was not explained by cardiovascular covariates, only by glycaemic measures. In addition to 120 min glucose, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy at borderline significance, age, and height were the independent determinants of sensory nerve dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glucose intolerance", "Impaired glucose tolerance", "Risk factors", "Sensory nerve dysfunction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autonomic Nervous System Diseases", "Biomarkers", "Blood Glucose", "Case-Control Studies", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electric Stimulation", "Female", "Glucose Tolerance Test", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Logistic Models", "Lower Extremity", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurologic Examination", "Odds Ratio", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Postprandial Period", "Risk Factors", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Sensory Thresholds", "Time Factors", "Upper Extremity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021408132", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26433734100": {"Name": "N\u00e9meth N.", "AuthorID": "26433734100", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "15848841300": {"Name": "Putz Z.", "AuthorID": "15848841300", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "6505778722": {"Name": "Istenes I.", "AuthorID": "6505778722", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "55602493900": {"Name": "K\u00f6rei A.E.", "AuthorID": "55602493900", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "55971124000": {"Name": "V\u00e1gi O.E.", "AuthorID": "55971124000", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "55970374000": {"Name": "Kempler M.", "AuthorID": "55970374000", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k G.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35411093000": {"Name": "Kempler P.", "AuthorID": "35411093000", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "15845462000": {"Name": "Gandhi R.", "AuthorID": "15845462000", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "56276747500": {"Name": "Tesfaye S.", "AuthorID": "56276747500", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "7005174030": {"Name": "Jermendy G.", "AuthorID": "7005174030", "AffiliationID": "60020341", "AffiliationName": "3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Hospital"}}}
