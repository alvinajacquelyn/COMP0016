Lower explosive hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H/Q) force ratio in the first 150 ms from activation onset could reflect an impaired capacity for knee joint stabilisation and increased risk of ACL injury. However, the explosive H/Q force ratio has not been compared between the sexes. Methods: The neuromuscular performance of untrained males and females (20 of each) was assessed during a series of isometric knee flexor and extensor contractions, specifically explosive and maximum voluntary contractions of each muscle group. Force, in absolute terms and normalised to body mass, and surface EMG of the hamstrings and quadriceps were recorded. Hamstrings force was expressed relative to quadriceps force to produce ratios of explosive H/Q force and H/Q maximum voluntary force (MVF). For the explosive contractions, agonist electromechanical delay (EMD) and agonist neural activation were also assessed. Results: The H/Q MVF ratio was greater in males (56 %) than females (50 %; P < 0.001). However, the explosive H/Q force ratio was similar between the sexes at each time point (25\u2013150 ms) from activation onset. Explosive hamstrings, but not quadriceps, force relative to body mass was greater for males compared to females. There were no sex differences in EMD or agonist activation for either of the muscle groups. Conclusions: The lack of a sex difference in early phase isometric explosive H/Q force ratio suggests other factors might be more important in determining the substantially higher knee injury rates of females.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior cruciate ligament", "Electromyography", "Muscle strength", "Rate of force development", "Sex differences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Isometric Contraction", "Leg", "Ligaments, Articular", "Male", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925495862", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"45661310800": {"Name": "Hannah R.", "AuthorID": "45661310800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603297184": {"Name": "Folland J.", "AuthorID": "6603297184", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "57199389473": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57199389473", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Life Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "36886986600": {"Name": "Minshull C.", "AuthorID": "36886986600", "AffiliationID": "60101496", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Queen Margaret University"}}}
