We aimed to specifically: exclude secondary headaches other than medication overuse, exclude primary headache disorders other than migraine and tension type headache (TTH), distinguish between chronic migraine and chronic TTH, and identify medication overuse headache. Methods: We held a headache classification consensus conference to draw on evidence and expertise to inform the content of a logic model underpinning the classification interview. Nurses trained to use the logic model did telephone classification interviews with participants recruited from primary care. Doctors specialising in headache did a second validation interview. Results: Twenty-six delegates attended the headache classification conference including headache specialist doctors, nurses and lay representatives (with chronic headache). We trained six nurses to do the classification interviews and completed 107 paired interviews, median days between interviews was 32 days (interquartile range 21-48 days). We measured level of agreement between the nurse and doctor interviews using proportion of concordance, simple kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Proportion of concordance of agreement between nurse and doctor interviews was 0.76, simple kappa coefficient \u03ba 0.31 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.52), and PABAK 0.51 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.68), a moderate agreement. In a sensitivity test following review of headache characteristics recorded, concordance was 0.91, \u03ba = 0.53 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.79), and PABAK = 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.92), a very good agreement. Conclusion: We developed and validated a new evidence-based telephone classification interview that can be used by a non-headache specialist to classify common chronic headache types in primary care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic headache", "Classification", "Development", "Primary care", "Telephone interviews", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Headache Disorders", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059680850", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"7202993090": {"Name": "Potter R.", "AuthorID": "7202993090", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7101735589": {"Name": "Underwood M.", "AuthorID": "7101735589", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57188947725": {"Name": "Hee S.W.", "AuthorID": "57188947725", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7006600564": {"Name": "Griffiths F.", "AuthorID": "7006600564", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57201064989": {"Name": "Hoverd E.", "AuthorID": "57201064989", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57205349122": {"Name": "Dodd K.", "AuthorID": "57205349122", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "6701699175": {"Name": "Matharu M.", "AuthorID": "6701699175", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache Group, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
