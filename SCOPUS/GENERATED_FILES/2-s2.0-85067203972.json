Given a fitted multi-state model with one death state, it is possible to estimate state-specific and marginal life expectancies. This paper introduces methods and new software for computing these expectancies. Methods: The definition of state-specific life expectancy given current age is an extension of mean survival in standard survival analysis. The computation involves the estimated parameters of a fitted multi-state model, and numerical integration. The new R package elect provides user-friendly functions to do the computation in the R software. Results: The estimation of life expectancies is explained and illustrated using the elect package. Functions are presented to explore the data, to estimate the life expectancies, and to present results. Conclusions: State-specific life expectancies provide a communicable representation of health-related processes. The availability and explanation of the elect package will help researchers to compute life expectancies and to present their findings in an assessable way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gompertz distribution", "Interval censoring", "Markov model", "Panel data", "Sojourn time", "Stochastic process"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gompertz distributions", "Interval censoring", "Markov model", "Panel data", "Sojourn time", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Algorithms", "Female", "Humans", "Life Expectancy", "Likelihood Functions", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Markov Chains", "Medical Informatics", "Models, Statistical", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Regression Analysis", "Software", "Stochastic Processes", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067203972", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"6603479955": {"Name": "van den Hout A.", "AuthorID": "6603479955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London Gower Street"}, "57209280011": {"Name": "Sum Chan M.", "AuthorID": "57209280011", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and University of Oxford"}, "7005722061": {"Name": "Matthews F.", "AuthorID": "7005722061", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University"}}}
