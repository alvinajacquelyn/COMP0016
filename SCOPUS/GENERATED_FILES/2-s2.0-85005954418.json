Software products for analysis should be simple, free of charge, able to accept data directly from the sequencer (FASTQ files) and to provide the basic functionalities all-in-one. The main aim of this narrative review is to provide a practical guide for the clinical microbiologist, with little or no practical experience of WGS analysis, with a specific focus on software products tailor-made for M. tuberculosis analysis. With sequencing performed by an external provider, it is now feasible to implement WGS analysis in the routine clinical practice of any microbiology laboratory, with the potential to detect resistance weeks before traditional phenotypic culture methods, but the clinical microbiologist should be aware of the limitations of this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Online tools", "Phylogenetic analysis", "Rapid susceptibility testing", "Whole genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Bacterial Typing Techniques", "Computational Biology", "Genome, Bacterial", "Humans", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Phylogeny", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Software", "Tuberculosis", "Web Browser"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005954418", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"25626807100": {"Name": "Satta G.", "AuthorID": "25626807100", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57192379746": {"Name": "Atzeni A.", "AuthorID": "57192379746", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Department of Infection, University College London"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Department of Infection, University College London"}}}
