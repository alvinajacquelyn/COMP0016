We evaluate explanatory models of this hueshift effect using previous data obtained using L- and Mcone- isolating stimuli together with chromatic sensitivity and hue discrimination data. The key questions concerned what type of nonlinearity produced the hue shifts, and where the nonlinearities lay with respect to the early band-pass and late low-pass temporal filters in the chromatic pathways. We developed two plausible models: (a) a slew-rate limited nonlinearity that follows both early and late filters, and (b) a half-wave rectifying nonlinearity-consistent with the splitting of the visual input into ON- and OFF-channels-that lies between the early and late filters followed by a compressive nonlinearity that lies after the late filter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromatic flicker sensitivity", "Color", "Compressive nonlinearity", "Half-wave rectifier", "ON and OFF pathways", "Saturating nonlinearity", "Slew-rate limit", "Temporal vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Color Perception", "Cone Opsins", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Visual Pathways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033777799", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"7006086539": {"Name": "Stockman A.", "AuthorID": "7006086539", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7102449400": {"Name": "Henning G.", "AuthorID": "7102449400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57191329031": {"Name": "Rider A.", "AuthorID": "57191329031", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
