The proposed dilation curve analysis is very general, relying only on raw dilatation data and the density of some of the constituents involved in the transformations. Transformation start and end temperatures and instantaneous phase fractions are accurately measured using this method. As an example, the simultaneous transformation of austenite to bainite and martensite in seven cylindrical AISI 4140 steel samples cooled at rates between 1 and 4 K/s from 1223 K (950 \u00b0C) is used to show the feasibility of this new methodology. The martensite and bainite fractions calculated using the presented methodology for all seven samples are in good agreement with the ones measured with quantitative metallography. Hot stage microscopy was also performed on a sample of the same batch, yielding quantitative results consistent with the start temperatures from the analysis proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AISI 4140", "CCT diagram", "Dilation curve analysis (DCA)", "Dilatometry", "Hot-stage microscopy", "Simultaneous transformations"], "IndexKeywords": ["AISI 4140", "CCT diagram", "Curve analysis", "Dilatometry", "Hot-stage microscopy", "Simultaneous transformations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942885132", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"56176979400": {"Name": "Kamyabi-Gol A.", "AuthorID": "56176979400", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Alberta"}, "7004193780": {"Name": "Mendez P.", "AuthorID": "7004193780", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Alberta"}, "57188878779": {"Name": "Clark S.", "AuthorID": "57188878779", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Steel Research Centre, WMG, University of Warwick"}, "7102170153": {"Name": "Sridhar S.", "AuthorID": "7102170153", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Steel Research Centre, WMG, University of Warwick"}, "23479838800": {"Name": "Gibbs J.", "AuthorID": "23479838800", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University"}}}
