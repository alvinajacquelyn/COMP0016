Appropriate complementary feeding (CF) practices can greatly reduce this risk. Thus, we undertook a systematic review of studies assessing CF (timing, dietary diversity, meal frequency and influencing factors) in children aged <2 years in India. Design Searches between January 2000 and June 2016 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science, OVID Maternity & Infant Care, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, BanglaJOL, POPLINE and WHO Global Health Library. Eligibility criteria: primary research on CF practices in SA children aged 0-2 years and/or their families. Search terms: 'children', 'feeding' and 'Asians' and derivatives. Two researchers undertook study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal (EPPI-Centre Weight of Evidence). Results From 45 712 abstracts screened, sixty-four cross-sectional, seven cohort, one qualitative and one case-control studies were included. Despite adopting the WHO Infant and Young Child Feeding guidelines, suboptimal CF practices were found in all studies. In twenty-nine of fifty-nine studies, CF was introduced between 6 and 9 months, with eight studies finding minimum dietary diversity was achieved in 6-33 %, and ten of seventeen studies noting minimum meal frequency in only 25-50 % of the study populations. Influencing factors included cultural influences, poor knowledge on appropriate CF practices and parental educational status. Conclusions This is the first systematic review to evaluate CF practices in SA in India. Campaigns to change health and nutrition behaviour and revision of nationwide child health nutrition programmes are needed to meet the substantial unmet needs of these children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Complementary feeding", "India", "Infant", "Nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Feeding", "Culture", "Diet", "Feeding Behavior", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "India", "Infant", "Infant Care", "Infant Food", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Infant, Newborn", "Meals", "Mothers", "Nutritional Status", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Weaning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044284257", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36499843200": {"Name": "Manikam L.", "AuthorID": "36499843200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57201312160": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "57201312160", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6506572494": {"Name": "Lakhanpaul M.", "AuthorID": "6506572494", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57201320114": {"Name": "Prasad A.", "AuthorID": "57201320114", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, GKT School of Medical Education"}, "57201317267": {"Name": "Light A.", "AuthorID": "57201317267", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, GKT School of Medical Education"}, "57201327704": {"Name": "Dharmaratnam A.", "AuthorID": "57201327704", "AffiliationID": "60017977, 60033125", "AffiliationName": "Leicester Medical School, University of Leicester"}, "57201315013": {"Name": "Moen C.", "AuthorID": "57201315013", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George's University of London"}, "57201309388": {"Name": "Robinson A.", "AuthorID": "57201309388", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "St George's Hospital"}, "6701750970": {"Name": "Lingam R.", "AuthorID": "6701750970", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}}}
