With current methods, it can be challenging to replicate anatomically-realistic vasculature. Here, we present a novel method that enables the fabrication of complex vascular phantoms. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in two forms was used to create wall-less vessels and the surrounding tissue mimicking material (TMM). For the latter, PVA cryogel (PVA-c) was used as the TMM, which was made from a solution of PVA (10% by weight), distilled water, and glass spheres for ultrasonic scattering (0.5% by weight). PVA-c is not water soluble, and after a freeze-Thaw cycle it is mechanically robust. To form the wall-less vessels, vessel structures were 3D printed in water-soluble PVA and submerged in the aqueous solution of PVA-c. Once the PVA-c had solidified, the 3D printed PVA vessel structures were dissolved in water. Three phantoms were created, as initial demonstrations of the capabilities of this method: A straight vessel, a stenosed (narrowed), and a bifurcated (branched) vessel. Ultrasound images of the phantoms had realistic appearances. We conclude that this method is promising for creating wall-less, anatomically realistic, vascular phantoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Phantoms", "poly(vinyl alcohol)", "ultrasound", "vessels", "wall-less"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Calibration and validations", "Freeze-thaw cycles", "Mechanically robust", "Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)", "Tissue-mimicking materials", "vessels", "wall-less"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064383212", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57193590358": {"Name": "Mackle E.C.", "AuthorID": "57193590358", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences"}, "56038489100": {"Name": "Maneas E.", "AuthorID": "56038489100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences"}, "57214881494": {"Name": "Little C.", "AuthorID": "57214881494", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57208305349": {"Name": "Carr E.", "AuthorID": "57208305349", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences"}, "36337500900": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "36337500900", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, Lambeth Wing St.Thomas' Hospital"}, "57188642825": {"Name": "Nikitichev D.", "AuthorID": "57188642825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "34971090100": {"Name": "Finlay M.C.", "AuthorID": "34971090100", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London and Barts Heart Centre"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "6603035925": {"Name": "Rakhit R.D.", "AuthorID": "6603035925", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences"}}}
