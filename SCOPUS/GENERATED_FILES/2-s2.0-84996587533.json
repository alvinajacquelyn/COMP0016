Background: Research suggests there may be specific psychological and social factors relevant to ageing for individuals with a nonheterosexual identity. Design: A systematic review was conducted on empirical research involving lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals aged 60 or above. Methods: The Cochrane Database, PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched and 41 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority had not been reviewed in earlier review articles. Results: Findings were within two domains: psychological, consisting of sub-themes relating to identity, mental health and body image; and social, consisting of relationships, social support, discrimination, caregiving and receiving, community, accessing services and housing. The results suggest lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals mostly adjust well to ageing identities, with mediating influences including self-acceptance and connection with peers. Challenges experienced included ageism and heteronormative health and social care services; intimate friendships, social support and respectful professionals mitigated such threats and facilitated successful ageing. Methodological issues related to sampling procedures, such as purposive sampling through the gay community and limited generalisability due to the homogeneity of participants. Additionally, there was a widespread lack of heterosexual control groups. However, most studies used appropriate measures and acknowledged inherent limitations. Conclusion: Psychosocial influences included the challenge of societal stigma, but also resilience individuals demonstrate through a positive attitude. These factors must continue to be investigated for services to best meet the needs of this population. Relevance to clinical practice: Clinicians are well placed to assist individuals draw on resilience when facing ageing challenges. Also, clinicians should be aware older people may have prior negative experiences of accessing services and try to involve \u2018families of choice\u2019 in care planning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ageing", "gay and bisexual", "lesbian", "older adults", "psychosocial", "sexuality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Female", "Health Services for the Aged", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Sexual Minorities", "Social Stigma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996587533", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"56694880100": {"Name": "McParland J.", "AuthorID": "56694880100", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "35267762400": {"Name": "Camic P.M.", "AuthorID": "35267762400", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}}}
