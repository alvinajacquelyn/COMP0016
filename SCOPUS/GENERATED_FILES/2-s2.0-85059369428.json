Under conventional conditions, the borane was found to be active only in the hydroboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates, with alkenes and alkynes not being reduced effectively. The use of microwave irradiation on the other hand has permitted alkenes and alkynes to be hydroborated in good yields.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059369428", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57205293476": {"Name": "Carden J.L.", "AuthorID": "57205293476", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building, Park Place"}, "57205293572": {"Name": "Gierlichs L.J.", "AuthorID": "57205293572", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building, Park Place"}, "6701707900": {"Name": "Wass D.F.", "AuthorID": "6701707900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Cantock's Close"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.L.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building, Park Place"}, "25932202400": {"Name": "Melen R.L.", "AuthorID": "25932202400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building, Park Place"}}}
