However, less is known about ADHD medication use among European children and adolescents. A repeated cross-sectional design was applied to national or regional data extracts from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) for calendar years 2005/2006\u20132012. The prevalence of ADHD medication use was assessed, stratified by age and sex. Furthermore, the most commonly prescribed ADHD medications were assessed. ADHD medication use prevalence increased from 1.8% to 3.9% in the Netherlands cohort (relative increase: +111.9%), from 3.3% to 3.7% in the US cohort (+10.7%), from 1.3% to 2.2% in the German cohort (+62.4%), from 0.4% to 1.5% in the Danish cohort (+302.7%), and from 0.3% to 0.5% in the UK cohort (+56.6%). ADHD medication use was highest in 10\u201314-year olds, peaking in the Netherlands (7.1%) and the US (8.8%). Methylphenidate use predominated in Europe, whereas in the US amphetamines were nearly as common as methylphenidate. Although there was a substantially greater use of ADHD medications in the US cohort, there was a relatively greater increase in ADHD medication use in youth in the four European countries. ADHD medication use patterns in the US differed markedly from those in western European countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Methylphenidate", "Pharmacoepidemiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Male", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Prevalence", "United States", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015743754", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"16506232600": {"Name": "Bachmann C.J.", "AuthorID": "16506232600", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Philipps-University Marburg"}, "37109070100": {"Name": "Wijlaars L.P.", "AuthorID": "37109070100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "8969838400": {"Name": "Kalverdijk L.J.", "AuthorID": "8969838400", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "25647496900": {"Name": "Burcu M.", "AuthorID": "25647496900", "AffiliationID": "60014653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research, University of Maryland"}, "7006225474": {"Name": "Zito J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006225474", "AffiliationID": "60014653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Maryland"}, "7003534320": {"Name": "Glaeske G.", "AuthorID": "7003534320", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Long-Term Care and Pensions, SOCIUM Research Center on Inequality and Social Policy, University of Bremen"}, "55875643200": {"Name": "Schuiling-Veninga C.C.M.", "AuthorID": "55875643200", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pharmacotherapy, -Epidemiology and -Economics, Department of Pharmacy, University of Groningen"}, "56268231400": {"Name": "Hoffmann F.", "AuthorID": "56268231400", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg"}, "18533678500": {"Name": "Aagaard L.", "AuthorID": "18533678500", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark"}}}
