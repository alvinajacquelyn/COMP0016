Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson's disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, catp-5, catp-6 and catp-7, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of C. elegans. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in catp-5(0); catp-6(0) and catp-6(0) catp-7(0) double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of ina-1 (alpha integrin ortholog) and vab-3 (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for ina-1and/or vab-3 function. This is potentially a conserved regulatory interaction, since mammalian ATP13A2, alpha integrin and Pax6 are all required for proper dopaminergic neuron function.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Movement", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Luminescent Proteins", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation", "Organelles", "Phylogeny", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044144374", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57160166800": {"Name": "Zielich J.", "AuthorID": "57160166800", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University, Planegg-Martinsried"}, "57201270265": {"Name": "Tzima E.", "AuthorID": "57201270265", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University, Planegg-Martinsried"}, "57201272037": {"Name": "Schr\u00f6der E.", "AuthorID": "57201272037", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University, Planegg-Martinsried"}, "57201279963": {"Name": "Jemel F.", "AuthorID": "57201279963", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University, Planegg-Martinsried"}, "26642930200": {"Name": "Conradt B.", "AuthorID": "26642930200", "AffiliationID": "60028717, 60075024", "AffiliationName": "Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich, Ludwig Maximilian University"}, "7003524809": {"Name": "Lambie E.", "AuthorID": "7003524809", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University, Planegg-Martinsried"}}}
