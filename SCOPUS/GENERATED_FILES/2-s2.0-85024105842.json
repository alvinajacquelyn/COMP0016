Importantly, the sequences of key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis are highly conserved between sheep and human. The processing of the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein is conserved between sheep and human, and sheep A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also very similar to human. In addition, total tau and neurofilament light levels in CSF are comparable with those found in human. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in aged sheep brain has previously been established; here, we report for the first time that plaques, the other pathologic hallmark of AD, are also present in the aged sheep brain. In summary, the biological machinery to generate the key neuropathologic features of AD is conserved between the human and sheep, making the sheep a good candidate for future genetic manipulation to accelerate the condition for use in pathophysiological discovery and therapeutic testing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Animal model", "Plaques", "Sheep Ovis aries", "Tangles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Sheep", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024105842", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"7201777582": {"Name": "Reid S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201777582", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "The Neurogenetics Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "57194901920": {"Name": "Mckean N.E.", "AuthorID": "57194901920", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "The Neurogenetics Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "22034973200": {"Name": "Henty K.", "AuthorID": "22034973200", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "The Neurogenetics Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "56364047700": {"Name": "Handley R.R.", "AuthorID": "56364047700", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "The Neurogenetics Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "7101697237": {"Name": "Snell R.G.", "AuthorID": "7101697237", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "The Neurogenetics Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8552131000": {"Name": "Rudiger S.R.", "AuthorID": "8552131000", "AffiliationID": "60013121", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biology and Reproductive Technology Laboratories, Livestock and Farming Systems Division, South Australian Research and Development Institute"}, "6602390383": {"Name": "Bawden C.S.", "AuthorID": "6602390383", "AffiliationID": "60013121", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biology and Reproductive Technology Laboratories, Livestock and Farming Systems Division, South Australian Research and Development Institute"}, "57213795607": {"Name": "Verma P.J.", "AuthorID": "57213795607", "AffiliationID": "60013121", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biology and Reproductive Technology Laboratories, Livestock and Farming Systems Division, South Australian Research and Development Institute"}, "7006319744": {"Name": "Faull R.L.M.", "AuthorID": "7006319744", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Medical Imaging and The Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "7003784228": {"Name": "Waldvogel H.J.", "AuthorID": "7003784228", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Medical Imaging and The Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland"}}}
