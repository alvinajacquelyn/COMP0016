Recently, it was established that a randomized version of the method enjoys an exponential convergence for well-posed problems, and the convergence rate is determined by a variant of the condition number. In this work, we analyze the preasymptotic convergence behavior of the randomized Kaczmarz method, and show that the low-frequency error (with respect to the right singular vectors) decays faster during first iterations than the high-frequency error. Under the assumption that the initial error is smooth (e.g. sourcewise representation), the result explains the fast empirical convergence behavior, thereby shedding new insights into the excellent performance of the randomized Kaczmarz method in practice. Further, we propose a simple strategy to stabilize the asymptotic convergence of the iteration by means of variance reduction. We provide extensive numerical experiments to confirm the analysis and to elucidate the behavior of the algorithms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["error estimates", "preasymptotic convergence", "randomized Kaczmarz method", "Smoothness", "variance reduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Error estimates", "Kaczmarz method", "preasymptotic convergence", "Smoothness", "Variance reductions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038354477", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55885381100": {"Name": "Jiao Y.", "AuthorID": "55885381100", "AffiliationID": "60024979", "AffiliationName": "School of Statistics and Mathematics, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "24468723000": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "24468723000", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hubei Key Laboratory of Computational Science, Wuhan University"}}}
