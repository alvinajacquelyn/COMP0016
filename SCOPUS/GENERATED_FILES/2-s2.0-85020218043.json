Methods: Phantoms containing fat, water, and trabecular bone were constructed with proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and bone mineral density (BMD) values matching those expected in healthy bone marrow and disease states, and scanned using chemical shift-encoded MRI (CSE-MRI) at 3T. Measured PDFF and R2* values in phantoms were compared with reference FF and BMD values. Eight spondyloarthritis patients and 10 controls underwent CSE-MRI of the sacroiliac joints. PDFF and R2* in areas of inflamed bone and fat metaplasia in patients were compared with normal bone marrow in controls. Results: In phantoms, PDFF measurements were accurate over the full range of PDFF and BMD values. R2* measurements were positively associated with BMD but also were influenced by variations in PDFF. In patients, PDFF was reduced in areas of inflammation and increased in fat metaplasia compared to normal marrow. R2* measurements were significantly reduced in areas of fat metaplasia. Conclusion: PDFF measurements reflect changes in marrow composition in areas of active inflammation and structural damage and could be used for disease monitoring in spondyloarthritis. R2* measurements may provide additional information bone mineral density but also are influenced by fat content.
