All rights reserved.Objectives To explore regional cerebral oxygen saturations (rcSO2) in preterm neonates initially stabilized with 0.3 fractionated inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentrations. We hypothesized that those infants who received >0.3 FiO2 during stabilization following delivery would have relatively higher rcSO2 postdelivery compared with those stabilized with a lower FiO2. Study design A single center prospective observational study of 47 infants born before 32 weeks. Using near infrared spectroscopy, rcSO2 values were recorded immediately after birth. All preterm infants were initially given 0.3 FiO2 and were divided into 2 groups according to subsequent FiO2 requirements of either \u22640.3 or >0.3 FiO;bsubesub Using a mixed-effects model, we compared the difference between the groups over time. Also, the area measures below 55% (hypoxia) and above 85% (hyperoxia) were compared between the groups. Results The mean (SD) gestation was 29.4 (1.6) weeks and the mean (SD) weight was 1.3 (0.4) kg. Less than one-half of the infants (20/45; 43%) required \u22640.3 FiO2. In the delivery suite, the median (IQR) rcSO2 in the low and high FiO2 groups were 81% (66%-86%) and 72% (62%-86%), respectively. Patients in the high FiO2 group had a larger rcSO2 area below 55% (P =.01). There was a significant difference in rcSO2 between the groups (P <.05), with the low group having higher rcSO2 values initially, but this difference changed over time. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), rcSO2 values were lower by 7.1% (CI 12.13 to 2.06%) P =.008 in the high FiO2 group. Conclusions Infants given >0.3 FiO2 had more cerebral hypoxia than infants requiring \u22640.3 FiO;bsubesub but no difference in the degree of cerebral hyperoxia, both in the delivery suite and the NICU. This suggests that a more rapid increase in oxygen titration maybe be required initially for preterm infants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CBF Cerebral blood flow", "FiO2 Fractionated inspired oxygen", "HR Heart rate", "NICU Neonatal intensive care unit", "NIRS Near infrared spectroscopy", "rcSO2 Regional cerebral oxygen saturation", "SpO2 Peripheral oxygen saturation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anoxia", "Birth Weight", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Hyperoxia", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Intensive Care, Neonatal", "Male", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Prospective Studies", "Respiration, Artificial", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955188182", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"54986293100": {"Name": "Kenosi M.", "AuthorID": "54986293100", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "15923829700": {"Name": "O'Toole J.", "AuthorID": "15923829700", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "55758518800": {"Name": "Hawkes G.", "AuthorID": "55758518800", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "36462688100": {"Name": "Ryan A.", "AuthorID": "36462688100", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "8592149500": {"Name": "Dempsey E.", "AuthorID": "8592149500", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "56850320600": {"Name": "Livingston V.", "AuthorID": "56850320600", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "7006034036": {"Name": "O'Halloran K.", "AuthorID": "7006034036", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, University College Cork"}}}
