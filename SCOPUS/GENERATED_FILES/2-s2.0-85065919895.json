Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aims: Several studies and registries have demonstrated sustained reductions in blood pressure (BP) after renal denervation (RDN). The long-term safety and efficacy after RDN in real-world patients with uncontrolled hypertension, however, remains unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of RDN, including its effects on renal function. Methods and results: The Global SYMPLICITY Registry is a prospective, open-label registry conducted at 196 active sites worldwide in hypertensive patients receiving RDN treatment. Among 2237 patients enrolled and treated with the SYMPLICITY Flex catheter, 1742 were eligible for follow-up at 3 years. Baseline office and 24-h ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) were 166 \u00b1 25 and 154 \u00b1 18 mmHg, respectively. SBP reduction after RDN was sustained over 3 years, including decreases in both office (-16.5 \u00b1 28.6 mmHg, P < 0.001) and 24-h ambulatory SBP (-8.0 \u00b1 20.0 mmHg; P < 0.001). Twenty-one percent of patients had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Between baseline and 3 years, renal function declined by 7.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2; baseline eGFR 87 \u00b1 17 mL/min/1.73 m2) and by 3.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients with CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2; baseline eGFR 47 \u00b1 11 mL/min/1.73 m2). No long-term safety concerns were observed following the RDN procedure. Conclusion: Long-term data from the Global SYMPLICITY Registry representing the largest available cohort of hypertensive patients receiving RDN in a real-world clinical setting demonstrate both the safety and efficacy of the procedure with significant and sustained office and ambulatory BP reductions out to 3 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring", "Denervation", "Hypertension", "Renal function", "SYMPLICITY"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Kidney", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Sympathectomy", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065919895", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26428326200": {"Name": "Mahfoud F.", "AuthorID": "26428326200", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Saarland University Hospital"}, "35392235500": {"Name": "B\u00f6hm M.", "AuthorID": "35392235500", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Saarland University Hospital"}, "55576025600": {"Name": "Ewen S.", "AuthorID": "55576025600", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Saarland University Hospital"}, "7101834901": {"Name": "Schmieder R.", "AuthorID": "7101834901", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Hospital Erlangen"}, "7006238742": {"Name": "Narkiewicz K.", "AuthorID": "7006238742", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hypertension and Diabetology, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "36039926200": {"Name": "Ruilope L.", "AuthorID": "36039926200", "AffiliationID": "60004024, 60028356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Risk, Hypertension Unit and Cardiorenal Translational Research Laboratory, Institute of Research i + 12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre and CIBERCV, School of Doctoral Studies and Research, Universidad Europea de Madrid"}, "7003349164": {"Name": "Schlaich M.", "AuthorID": "7003349164", "AffiliationID": "60030929, 60031806, 60189720", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Dobney Hypertension Centre, School of Medicine-Royal Perth Hospital Unit, University of Western Australia"}, "57198065489": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "57198065489", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7007123335": {"Name": "Fahy M.", "AuthorID": "7007123335", "AffiliationID": "60000723", "AffiliationName": "Coronary and Structural Heart Division, Medtronic PLC"}, "36039693200": {"Name": "Mancia G.", "AuthorID": "36039693200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "University of Milano-Bicocca"}}}
