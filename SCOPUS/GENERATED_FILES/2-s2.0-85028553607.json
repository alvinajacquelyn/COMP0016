They are recommended for extradural use but have intradural applications. Brachial plexus reimplantation after trauma requires intradural fibrin glue because reimplanted nerves cannot be sutured to the spinal cord. Recently synthetic glues have become popular in spinal surgery but there is limited information about their safety. Our study compared the histological effects of Tisseel\u00ae, Adherus\u00ae and BioGlue\u00ae on spinal cord using our rat brachial plexus repair model. Materials & methods: Randomised observational animal study. Forty-one Sprague-Dawley rats divided in to control (n = 9), Tisseel\u00ae (n = 8), BioGlue\u00ae (n = 10) and Adherus\u00ae (n = 14) groups. Under general anaesthesia a posterior midline cervical incision was made and hemi-laminectomies performed at C7 and T1. Dura was opened and T1 dorsal root transected and repositioned on the spinal cord. Two drops of Tisseel\u00ae, BioGlue\u00ae, Adherus\u00ae or no glue (control) were applied over the cut nerve and cord. At days 7, 14 and 28 rats were euthanized, processed and sections stained with Haematoxylin & Eosin and evaluated blind by a neuropathologist. Results: Control and Tisseel\u00ae groups showed only mild focal inflammation in the cord. Adherus\u00ae and Bioglue\u00ae groups showed evidence of spinal cord inflammation and degeneration. All BioGlue\u00ae and Adherus\u00ae rats had evidence of distortion of the cord from the glue mass at all time points. Two BioGlue\u00ae-treated and one Adherus\u00ae-treated rat developed a hemiparesis. One BioGlue\u00ae rat developed hind limb paralysis. One BioGlue\u00ae rat failed to wake up at the end of the procedure. There were no complications in control and Tisseel\u00ae groups. Conclusion: Tisseel\u00ae caused a similar inflammatory response to control and may be used on spinal cord. BioGlue\u00ae and Adherus\u00ae should be applied thinly for a watertight dural closure but intradural use and contact with spinal tissue must be avoided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fibrin glue", "glutaraldehyde sealant", "in vivo", "inflammation", "polyethylene glycol hydrogel sealant", "Spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anesthesia, General", "Animals", "Dura Mater", "Fibrin Tissue Adhesive", "Inflammation", "Laminectomy", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Proteins", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Spinal Cord", "Spinal Nerves", "Tissue Adhesives", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028553607", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"16833700500": {"Name": "Kalsi P.", "AuthorID": "16833700500", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery, James Cook University Hospital"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004423623": {"Name": "Thom M.", "AuthorID": "7004423623", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
