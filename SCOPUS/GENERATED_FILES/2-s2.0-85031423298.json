How do we draw on feminist struggles for openness in common resources, from security to knowledge, as we inhabit a compromised space in commercial publishing? We think about this first in relation to the content of this issue: on image-based abuse continuums, asylum struggles, trials of protestors, customary justice, and not-so-timely reparations. Our thoughts take us through the different ways that openness and closure work in struggles against violence, cruel welcomes, and re-arrangements of code and custom. Secondly, we share some reflections on methodological openness and closure as the roundtable conversation on asylum, and the interview with Riles, remind us of #FLaK2016 and its method of scattering sources as we think about how best to mix knowledges. Thirdly, prompted by the FLaK kitchen table conversations on openness, publishing and \u2018getting the word out\u2019, we respond to Kember\u2019s call to \u2018open up open access\u2019. We explain the different current arrangements for opening up FLS content and how green open access, the sharedit initiative, author request and publisher discretion present alternatives to gold open access. Finally drawing on Franklin and Spade, we show how there are a range of \u2018wench tactics\u2019\u2014adapting gifts, stalling and resting\u2014which we deploy as academic editors who are trying to have an impact on the access, use and circulation of our journal, even though we do not own the journal we edit. These wench tactics are alternatives to the more obvious or reported tactic of resignation, or withdrawing academic labour from editing and reviewing altogether. They help us think about brewing editorial time, what ambivalence over our 25th birthday might mean, and how to inhabit painful places. In this, we respond in our own impure, compromised way to da Silva\u2019s call not to forget the native and slave as we do FLaK, and repurpose shrapnel, in our common commitments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031423298", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"]], "AuthorData": {"7201875170": {"Name": "Fletcher R.", "AuthorID": "7201875170", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "6508253395": {"Name": "Ashiagbor D.", "AuthorID": "6508253395", "AffiliationID": "60105355", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Advanced Legal Studies"}, "56857260000": {"Name": "Barker N.", "AuthorID": "56857260000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}, "12545206200": {"Name": "Grabham E.", "AuthorID": "12545206200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}, "57188642404": {"Name": "Cruz K.", "AuthorID": "57188642404", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "24465426900": {"Name": "McGuinness S.", "AuthorID": "24465426900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "55747955600": {"Name": "Russell Y.", "AuthorID": "55747955600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "56162452900": {"Name": "El-Enany N.", "AuthorID": "56162452900", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "35307539700": {"Name": "Keenan S.", "AuthorID": "35307539700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57160983800": {"Name": "Godden-Rasul N.", "AuthorID": "57160983800", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "University of Newcastle"}, "6602959942": {"Name": "Manji A.", "AuthorID": "6602959942", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University"}, "24477926000": {"Name": "McCandless J.", "AuthorID": "24477926000", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics"}, "56300349800": {"Name": "Ramshaw S.", "AuthorID": "56300349800", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "University of Victoria"}, "7006863344": {"Name": "Samuels H.", "AuthorID": "7006863344", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "University of Westminster"}, "55458031100": {"Name": "Stewart A.", "AuthorID": "55458031100", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick University"}, "55479833500": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "55479833500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}}}
