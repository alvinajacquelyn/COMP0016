However, only a limited number of Neolithic wheat grains have been found in central China and even fewer have been directly radiocarbon dated, making the date when wheat was adopted in the region and its role in subsistence farming uncertain. Based on systematic archaeobotanical data and direct dating of wheat remains from the Xiazhai site in central China, as well as a critical review of all reported discoveries of Neolithic and Bronze Age wheat from this region, we conclude that many wheat finds are intrusive in Neolithic contexts. We argue that the role of wheat in the subsistence of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age of central China was minimal, and that wheat only began to increase in its subsistence role in the later Bronze Age during the Zhou dynasty after ca. 1000 bc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Bronze Age", "Silk road", "Triticum aestivum", "Urbanisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067085228", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"56984973000": {"Name": "Deng Z.", "AuthorID": "56984973000", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60001298", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Northwest University"}, "36086977800": {"Name": "Chu X.", "AuthorID": "36086977800", "AffiliationID": "112620767", "AffiliationName": "Henan Provincial Bureau of Cultural Heritage"}, "57209515461": {"Name": "Cao Y.", "AuthorID": "57209515461", "AffiliationID": "105919208", "AffiliationName": "Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology"}, "57209255005": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "57209255005", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of History, Zhengzhou University"}, "57200544959": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57200544959", "AffiliationID": "100725817", "AffiliationName": "National Museum of China"}, "7404843246": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "7404843246", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
