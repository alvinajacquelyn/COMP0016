This database evolved from a list of protected areas first mandated by the United Nations in 1959, and it now informs the key indicators that track progress toward area-based conservation targets. In this capacity, the WDPA illuminates the role of protected areas in advancing a range of international objectives and agreements, including the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite ongoing challenges in maintaining such a complex global dataset, the WDPA is continuously improving and taking advantage of new technology, making it widely applicable to diverse users, including those in sectors far from its original intended audience. In the future, the WDPA will expand to include areas that contribute to conservation and sustainable use outside of formal protected areas, and will increasingly link to other key global datasets. These innovations in the way the WDPA is managed and used will deliver vital knowledge to support a sustainable future for biodiversity and people globally.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conservation of Natural Resources", "Databases as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064556877", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"57190075192": {"Name": "Bingham H.C.", "AuthorID": "57190075192", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "57016795700": {"Name": "Juffe Bignoli D.", "AuthorID": "57016795700", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "57203926256": {"Name": "Lewis E.", "AuthorID": "57203926256", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "55260603900": {"Name": "MacSharry B.", "AuthorID": "55260603900", "AffiliationID": "60102181", "AffiliationName": "European Environment Agency"}, "35301788600": {"Name": "Burgess N.D.", "AuthorID": "35301788600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, Natural History Museum, University of Copenhagen"}, "57190068128": {"Name": "Deguignet M.", "AuthorID": "57190068128", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "57208345465": {"Name": "Misrachi M.", "AuthorID": "57208345465", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "57208344478": {"Name": "Stewart J.L.", "AuthorID": "57208344478", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "57212850636": {"Name": "Kingston N.", "AuthorID": "57212850636", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"}, "26647965400": {"Name": "Visconti P.", "AuthorID": "26647965400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "56929706400": {"Name": "Walpole M.", "AuthorID": "56929706400", "AffiliationID": "60111668", "AffiliationName": "Fauna and Flora International"}, "57213798174": {"Name": "Brooks T.M.", "AuthorID": "57213798174", "AffiliationID": "60077485", "AffiliationName": "International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)"}}}
