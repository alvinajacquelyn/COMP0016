During this short lifespan the average neutrophil is thought to spend its initial hours shared about equally between residence in a marginated pool, reversibly attached to the endothelium of small blood vessels, and a circulating pool. 1 Marginated cells adjacent to an inflammatory locus can migrate between the endothelial cells and, through their basal lamina, into the underlying connective tissue. 2 Migration through the blood vessel wall and towards the focus of inflammation appears to occur by a taxic mechanism sensitive to the release of chemoattractant factors at that site. 3 One of the most potent chemoattractants released is C5a, generated via the complement pathway, 4 but diffusible peptides or denatured proteins resulting from proteolytic action at the site might also contribute to the concentration of neutrophils at these loci. 5 The major role of neutrophils at the inflammatory site appears to be phagocytosis and killing of microorganisms and the general destruction and clearance of cellular material. Therefore, neutrophils are able to adhere to endothelial surfaces, penetrate the blood vessel wall, locomote towards the site of inflammation, and thence recognize and internalize invading microorganisms. For these eventually sacrificial functions, the neutrophil is specialized.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052486408", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6603851813": {"Name": "Sheterline P.", "AuthorID": "6603851813", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Cell Biology, University of Liverpool"}, "56273327400": {"Name": "Rickard J.E.", "AuthorID": "56273327400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "NATO Research Fellow Senior Lecturer, Department of Cell Biology Department of Medical Cell Biology, E.
