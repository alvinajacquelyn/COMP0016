Methods: We report four cases of patients with a long history of cervical dystonia treated with botulinum toxin injections. Results: All patients developed pain and muscular weakness around the shoulder, with EMG studies suggesting brachial neuritis. Conclusions: In the context of these observations, we discuss the question of an association between brachial neuritis and botulinum toxin treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["botulinum toxin injections", "brachial neuritis", "neuralgic amyotrophy", "Parsonage-Turner syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058470006", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57205074514": {"Name": "Cani I.", "AuthorID": "57205074514", "AffiliationID": "60104781", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna"}, "55114382300": {"Name": "Latorre A.", "AuthorID": "55114382300", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Neurosciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6603452433": {"Name": "Cordivari C.", "AuthorID": "6603452433", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, National Hospital for neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "25642482400": {"Name": "Balint B.", "AuthorID": "25642482400", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
