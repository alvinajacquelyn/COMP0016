A series of Arctic temperatures, i.e., from room temperature to \u221280 \u00b0C, were applied to the target structure. Time-variant corrosion wastage was employed in the case of age-related damage. The ALPS/HULL progressive hull girder collapse analysis program based on the ISFEM (Idealized Super-size Finite Element Method) was used to evaluate the ultimate hull girder strength with the material properties determined from a series of tensile tests. Based on the results, the operability of aged ships operating under Arctic conditions was estimated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aged ship", "Arctic", "Non-ice class ship", "NSR (Northern Sea Route)", "Time-variant corrosion wastage model", "Ultimate hull girder strength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged ships", "Arctic", "Corrosion wastage", "Ice class", "Northern sea routes", "Ultimate Hull girder strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922985137", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"36911790200": {"Name": "Park D.", "AuthorID": "36911790200", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "55742881300": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "55742881300", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "23009087100": {"Name": "Kim B.", "AuthorID": "23009087100", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "37097077300": {"Name": "Ha Y.", "AuthorID": "37097077300", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
