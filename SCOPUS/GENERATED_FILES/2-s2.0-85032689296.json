The experimental setup was designed to allow for the simultaneous measurement of wave surface elevations, rigid body motions, tendon tensions, as well as the pressure distribution at the model's deck underside. The obtained results demonstrated the variability of all the measurements and provided insights into the effect of wave-in-deck loads on the platform behaviour, tendon tensions and slamming pressures and showed qualitative correlations between these parameters. Based on the repeated tests in several events with different wave parameters, general observations and conclusions were made with respect to the platform dynamics during the deck impact, tendon tensions, slack tendon situations, tendon ringing and local impact pressures. The results of this study could be used for calibrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyclonic conditions, tension leg platforms", "Dynamic response", "Extreme waves", "Wave-in-deck loads"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental investigations", "Extreme wave events", "Extreme waves", "Rigid-body motion", "Simultaneous measurement", "Slamming pressure", "Tension leg platforms (TLP)", "Wave-in-deck loads"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032689296", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56349134200": {"Name": "Abdussamie N.", "AuthorID": "56349134200", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "36084146600": {"Name": "Drobyshevski Y.", "AuthorID": "36084146600", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "21739922600": {"Name": "Ojeda R.", "AuthorID": "21739922600", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "25924671700": {"Name": "Amin W.", "AuthorID": "25924671700", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College, University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
