All rights reserved.We present the design and measurement of a high-density WDM transmitter from a simple, low-cost generic photonic foundry. Monolithic integration of active and passive devices on InP yields a compact circuit with 20 nm tuneability and 30 Gb/s modulation per channel. This results in a chip supporting 180 Gb/s with a high capacity density of 10 Gb/s/mm2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mach-Zehnder modulator", "Photonic integrated circuits", "Tunable laser", "WDM transmitter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active and passive device", "High capacity", "Low costs", "Mach Zehnder modulator", "Monolithic integration", "Photonic integrated circuits", "Tuneability"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044105456", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56288041500": {"Name": "Yao W.", "AuthorID": "56288041500", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "7103274622": {"Name": "Smit M.", "AuthorID": "7103274622", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "7003950726": {"Name": "Wale M.", "AuthorID": "7003950726", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology"}}}
