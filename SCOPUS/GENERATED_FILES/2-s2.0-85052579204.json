PLATO (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01995513) interrogated this hypothesis using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Patients and Methods In period one, men with chemotherapy-na\u00efve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received open-label enzalutamide 160 mg daily. Men with no prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase at weeks 13 and 21 were treated until PSA progression ($ 25% increase and $ 2 ng/mL above nadir), then randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio in period two to abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily with either enzalutamide or placebo (combination or control group, respectively) until disease progression as defined by the primary end point: progression-free survival (radiographic or unequivocal clinical progression or death during study). Secondary end points included time to PSA progression and PSA response in period two. Results Of 509 patients enrolled in period one, 251 were randomly assigned in period two. Median progression-free survival was 5.7 months in the combination group and 5.6 months in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.12; P = .22). There was no difference in the secondary end points. Grade 3 hypertension (10% v 2%) and increased ALT (6% v 2%) or AST (2% v 0%) were more frequent in the combination than the control group. Conclusion Combining enzalutamide with abiraterone acetate and prednisone is not indicated after PSA progression during treatment with enzalutamide alone; hypertension and elevated liver enzymes are more frequent with combination therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Androstenes", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Liver", "Male", "Phenylthiohydantoin", "Progression-Free Survival", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052579204", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"9740870900": {"Name": "Attard G.", "AuthorID": "9740870900", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "7003854479": {"Name": "Borre M.", "AuthorID": "7003854479", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University Hospital"}, "56051414500": {"Name": "Gurney H.", "AuthorID": "56051414500", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "16550296000": {"Name": "Loriot Y.", "AuthorID": "16550296000", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106080, 60106210, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Gustave Roussy, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale U981, University of Paris Saclay"}, "57203654481": {"Name": "Andresen-Daniil C.", "AuthorID": "57203654481", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "57203662984": {"Name": "Kalleda R.", "AuthorID": "57203662984", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "57209629794": {"Name": "Pham T.", "AuthorID": "57209629794", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "6603562552": {"Name": "Taplin M.E.", "AuthorID": "6603562552", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
