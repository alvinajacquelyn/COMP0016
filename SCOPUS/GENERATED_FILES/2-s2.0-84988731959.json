The focus of this article is on the representation of frailty; who employs the terms 'frail' or 'frailty' in social care, about whom and with what meanings? We report secondary analysis of interview data from two waves of a longitudinal study starting in 2008. Study participants were 240 social care managers/practitioners working in four English localities. Social care managers and practitioners did not talk at length about frailty as characterising the increasing needs of care users. The minority who talked about frailty used the term in three ways: describing a physical state not including dementia; describing a stable state, as distinct from those dying; and as a combination of physical and mental disabilities (i.e. dementia). Differences among the participants in this study about the meaning of frailty could have implications for policy makers and for communication with other staff, health professionals, older people and their relatives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ageing", "Frailty", "geriatrics", "health", "social care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988731959", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"7006601649": {"Name": "Manthorpe J.", "AuthorID": "7006601649", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London"}, "56823744200": {"Name": "Harris J.", "AuthorID": "56823744200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London"}, "56268087800": {"Name": "Moriarty J.", "AuthorID": "56268087800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London"}, "57202192581": {"Name": "Stevens M.", "AuthorID": "57202192581", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
