Despite its increasing use in basic and clinical research, surprisingly little is known about the test-retest reliability of spectral power and peak frequency measures of beta oscillatory signals from sensorimotor cortex. Establishing that these beta measures are stable over time in healthy populations is a necessary precursor to their use in the clinic. Here, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate intra-individual reliability of beta-band oscillations over six sessions, focusing on changes in beta activity during movement (Movement-Related Beta Desynchronization, MRBD) and after movement termination (Post-Movement Beta Rebound, PMBR). Subjects performed visually-cued unimanual wrist flexion and extension. We assessed Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and between-session correlations for spectral power and peak frequency measures of movement-related and resting beta activity. Movement-related and resting beta power from both sensorimotor cortices was highly reliable across sessions. Resting beta power yielded highest reliability (average ICC=0.903), followed by MRBD (average ICC=0.886) and PMBR (average ICC=0.663). Notably, peak frequency measures yielded lower ICC values compared to the assessment of spectral power, particularly for movement-related beta activity (ICC=0.386\u20130.402). Our data highlight that power measures of movement-related beta oscillations are highly reliable, while corresponding peak frequency measures show greater intra-individual variability across sessions. Importantly, our finding that beta power estimates show high intra-individual reliability over time serves to validate the notion that these measures reflect meaningful individual differences that can be utilised in basic research and clinical studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beta oscillations", "EEG", "Intraclass correlation coefficient", "Sensorimotor cortex", "Test-retest reliability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Beta Rhythm", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cues", "Electroencephalography", "Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Movement", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Reproducibility of Results", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Wrist", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006248461", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55699225900": {"Name": "Espenhahn S.", "AuthorID": "55699225900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55901527400": {"Name": "de Berker A.O.", "AuthorID": "55901527400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102178423": {"Name": "Ward N.S.", "AuthorID": "7102178423", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26642159800": {"Name": "van Wijk B.C.M.", "AuthorID": "26642159800", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Charit\u00e9 University Medicine"}, "53164690500": {"Name": "Rossiter H.E.", "AuthorID": "53164690500", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}}}
