The focus is on the commercial real estate markets in Beijing and Shanghai. It will help international investors understand the market environment, risk and market activity process. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In this research, the authors apply the market maturity framework and its key determinants based on previous work undertaken by Keogh and D\u2019Arcy (1994) and Chin et al. (2006) for the analysis of Chinese commercial property market. Particular focus is on Beijing and Shanghai. The questionnaire is designed to obtain fair and objective views from international property consultancy firms active in Beijing and Shanghai markets. There are not many of these international property consultancies. The reason why this type of business was selected was to insure that the business had an understanding of China\u2019s place in the global commercial real estate market as this market matures from its emerging market status. Findings \u2013 The findings reveal that the respondents felt the commercial property markets in Shanghai and Beijing were now moderately mature. However, issues such as poorer level of standard market information, development instability, low transparency of the legal system, high taxes and high government invention still existed in China\u2019s commercial property market, therefore hindering its progress towards greater market maturity. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The small same size of the survey is the major limitation of the research. Practical implications \u2013 International investors and analysts can benefit from the research findings through a better understanding of the behaviour and trends in this unique market which will be reflected in their decision-making process. Originality/value \u2013 An explorative approach was used due to the lack of data to examine the perception of China\u2019s commercial property market\u2019s evolution and maturity. The findings can then be placed in the context of other Southeast Asian cities. The evolutionary process of China\u2019s property market is rarely examined in previous studies of China property market due to the lack of data and transparency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beijing", "China", "Commercial property market", "Evolution", "Maturity", "Shanghai Paper type Research paper"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921765367", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"24448189800": {"Name": "Ke Q.", "AuthorID": "24448189800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Built Environment, University College London"}, "55952517600": {"Name": "Sieracki K.", "AuthorID": "55952517600", "AffiliationID": "113629240", "AffiliationName": "KASPAR Associates Ltd"}}}
