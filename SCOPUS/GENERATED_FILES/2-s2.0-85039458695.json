An account of key functions mediated by purinoceptors follows, including examples of both short-term and long-term (trophic) signalling and a table showing the selective agonists and antagonists for the purinoceptor subtypes. References to evolution and roles of purinoceptors in pathological conditions are also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Development", "Neurotransmission", "Pathophysiology", "Regeneration", "Secretion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Purinergic Agonists", "Purinergic Antagonists", "Receptors, Purinergic", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039458695", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}}}
