Yet, the latter is poorly correlated with many other clinically relevant characteristics of the disease. Thus, the identification of biomarkers to more accurately assess this heterogeneity and disease severity may facilitate the discovery and development of new treatments and better management of patients with COPD. One molecule that has attracted attention as a potentially useful biomarker specifically for the emphysema subpopulation is the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE). As the soluble isoform of a key proinflammatory signaling receptor, sRAGE acts as a \"decoy\" for RAGE ligands and prevents their interaction with the receptor. Multiple reports have now linked sRAGE to COPD, and more specifically to emphysema, and evidence is accumulating that this link is likelymechanistic in nature. Here we review the current state of knowledge about sRAGE biology, the mechanistic links to COPD, and the evidence for using it as a biomarker for emphysema. We also discuss sRAGE as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in COPD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "Emphysema", "Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced Glycosylation End Product-Specific Receptor", "Biomarkers", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Lung", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943328857", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"56891667600": {"Name": "Yonchuk J.G.", "AuthorID": "56891667600", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "36544084500": {"Name": "Miller B.E.", "AuthorID": "36544084500", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "6603373403": {"Name": "Tal-Singer R.", "AuthorID": "6603373403", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "57213309943": {"Name": "Mayer R.J.", "AuthorID": "57213309943", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "57203069737": {"Name": "Silverman E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203069737", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60010869, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "56773748500": {"Name": "Bowler R.P.", "AuthorID": "56773748500", "AffiliationID": "60102305", "AffiliationName": "National Jewish Health"}, "7101749378": {"Name": "Agust\u00ed A.", "AuthorID": "7101749378", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60102756, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Institute, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Respiratorias"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biochemical Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
