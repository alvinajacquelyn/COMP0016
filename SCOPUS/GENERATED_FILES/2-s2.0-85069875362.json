This code has many advantageous properties such as a high error threshold and a planar layout of physical qubits where each physical qubit need only interact with its nearest neighbors. However, the transversal logical gates available in 2D surface codes are limited. This means that an additional (resource-intensive) procedure known as magic state distillation is required to do universal quantum computing with 2D surface codes. Here, we examine three-dimensional (3D) surface codes in the context of quantum computation. We introduce a picture for visualizing 3D surface codes which is useful for analyzing stacks of three 3D surface codes. We use this picture to prove that the CZ and CCZ gates are transversal in 3D surface codes. We also generalize the techniques of 2D surface-code lattice surgery to 3D surface codes. We combine these results and propose two quantum computing architectures based on 3D surface codes. Magic state distillation is not required in either of our architectures. Finally, we show that a stack of three 3D surface codes can be transformed into a single 3D color code (another type of quantum error-correcting code) using code concatenation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fault-tolerant architectures", "Nearest neighbors", "Quantum computing architectures", "Quantum error correcting codes", "Three-dimensional (3D) surfaces", "Three-dimensional surface", "Two Dimensional (2 D)", "Universal quantum computing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069875362", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57210189270": {"Name": "Vasmer M.", "AuthorID": "57210189270", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7102407945": {"Name": "Browne D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102407945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
