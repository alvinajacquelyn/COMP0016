Validation of the conversion based on real tissue samples is more direct than the current practice solely based on tissue substitutes and can potentially address variations over the population. Based on a novel dose extinction method, we measured water equivalent path lengths (WEPL) on animal tissue samples to evaluate the accuracy of CT HU to RSP conversion and potential variations over a population. A broad proton beam delivered a spread out Bragg peak to the samples sandwiched between a water tank and a 2D ion-chamber detector. WEPLs of the samples were determined from the transmission dose profiles measured as a function of the water level in the tank. Tissue substitute inserts and Lucite blocks with known WEPLs were used to validate the accuracy. A large number of real tissue samples were measured. Variations of WEPL over different batches of tissue samples were also investigated. The measured WEPLs were compared with those computed from CT scans with the Stoichiometric calibration method. WEPLs were determined within \u00b1 0.5% percentage deviation (% std/mean) and \u00b1 0.5% error for most of the tissue surrogate inserts and the calibration blocks. For biological tissue samples, percentage deviations were within \u00b1 0.3%. No considerable difference (<1%) in WEPL was observed for the same type of tissue from different sources. The differences between measured WEPLs and those calculated from CT were within 1%, except for some bony tissues. Depending on the sample size, each dose extinction measurement took around 5 min to produce \u223c1000 WEPL values to be compared with calculations. This dose extinction system measures WEPL efficiently and accurately, which allows the validation of CT HU to RSP conversions based on the WEPL measured for a large number of samples and real tissues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dose extinction", "proton therapy", "real tissue", "RSP", "stoichiometric", "water equivalent path length", "WEPL"], "IndexKeywords": ["Extinction measurements", "Percentage deviation", "Potential variations", "Proton therapy", "Spread out Bragg peaks", "stoichiometric", "Water equivalent", "WEPL", "Calibration", "Proton Therapy", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiometry", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021677179", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55156709300": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "55156709300", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "57194686769": {"Name": "Baer E.", "AuthorID": "57194686769", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7006318003": {"Name": "Jee K.W.", "AuthorID": "7006318003", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "35467815400": {"Name": "Sharp G.C.", "AuthorID": "35467815400", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "57190497596": {"Name": "Flanz J.", "AuthorID": "57190497596", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7404843537": {"Name": "Lu H.M.", "AuthorID": "7404843537", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}}}
