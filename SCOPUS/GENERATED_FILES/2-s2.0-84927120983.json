The hypothesis was tested in an orthotopic rabbit model of pancreatic cancer, by establishing the model, imaging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and contrast CT, and spatially comparing the perfusion maps to the exvivo uptake values of the injected photosensitizer, verteporfin. Materials and Methods: Nine New Zealand white rabbits underwent direct pancreas implantation of VX2 tumors, and CT perfusion or EUS was performed 10days postimplantation. Verteporfin was injected during CT imaging, and the tissue was removed 1hour postinjection for frozen tissue fluorescence scanning. Region-of-interest comparisons of CT data with exvivo fluorescence and histopathologic staining were performed. Results: Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT showed enhanced BF, BV, and PS in the tumor rim and decreased BF, BV, and PS in the tumor core. Significant correlations were found between exvivo verteporfin concentration and each of BF, BV, and PS. Conclusions: The efficacy of verteporfin delivery in tumors is estimated by perfusion CT, providing a noninvasive method of mapping photosensitizer dose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CT perfusion", "Dosimetry", "Drug delivery", "Pancreatic cancer", "Pharmacokinetics", "Photodynamic therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Contrast Media", "Disease Models, Animal", "Iohexol", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Pilot Projects", "Porphyrins", "Rabbits", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927120983", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57207717222": {"Name": "Elliott J.", "AuthorID": "57207717222", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "6507826223": {"Name": "Samkoe K.", "AuthorID": "6507826223", "AffiliationID": "60007267, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College"}, "7201609138": {"Name": "Gunn J.", "AuthorID": "7201609138", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "7005967291": {"Name": "Hoopes P.", "AuthorID": "7005967291", "AffiliationID": "60007267, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College"}, "7005432217": {"Name": "Pogue B.", "AuthorID": "7005432217", "AffiliationID": "60007267, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College"}, "7201864618": {"Name": "Gardner T.", "AuthorID": "7201864618", "AffiliationID": "60007267, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College"}, "7102199279": {"Name": "Stewart E.", "AuthorID": "7102199279", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, Western University"}, "8339897000": {"Name": "Lee T.", "AuthorID": "8339897000", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, Western University"}, "12809610500": {"Name": "Tichauer K.", "AuthorID": "12809610500", "AffiliationID": "60002873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7101783278": {"Name": "Hasan T.", "AuthorID": "7101783278", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital"}}}
