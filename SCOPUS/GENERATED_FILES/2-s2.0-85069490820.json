This is challenging for grid-based collocation methods when such distributions do not coincide with the grid points, for instance when the source is a curved, two-dimensional surface embedded in a three-dimensional domain. Typically, grid points close to the source surface are defined as source points, but this can result in \"staircasing\" and substantial errors in the resulting acoustic fields. This paper describes a technique for accurately representing arbitrary source distributions within Fourier collocation methods. The method works by applying a discrete, band-limiting convolution operator to the continuous source distribution, after which source grid weights can be generated. This allows arbitrarily shaped sources, for example, focused bowls and circular pistons, to be defined on the grid without staircasing errors. The technique is examined through simulations of a range of ultrasound sources, and comparisons with analytical solutions show excellent accuracy and convergence rates. Extensions of the technique are also discussed, including application to initial value problems, distributed sensors, and moving sources.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Convolution operators", "Fourier collocation method", "Sensor distributions", "Source distribution", "Three-dimensional domain", "Two-dimensional surface", "Ultrasound simulation", "Ultrasound sources"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069490820", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"56043355700": {"Name": "Wise E.", "AuthorID": "56043355700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "13408713400": {"Name": "Jaros J.", "AuthorID": "13408713400", "AffiliationID": "60083321", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology"}}}
