Our approach highlights how conditioning a joint entwined/entangled state with a predicate on one of its components has 'crossover' influence on the other components. We use the total variation metric on probability distributions to quantitatively measure such influence. These insights are applied to give a rigorous explanation of the fundamental concept of d-separation in Bayesian networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian network", "Influence", "Probability distribution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian reasoning", "Formal definition", "Formal Semantics", "Fundamental concepts", "Influence", "Total variation metric"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038415538", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56253290100": {"Name": "Jacobs B.", "AuthorID": "56253290100", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud Universiteit"}, "6507161816": {"Name": "Zanasi F.", "AuthorID": "6507161816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
