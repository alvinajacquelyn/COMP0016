A novel route to hollow Co3O4 nanospheres doped with ZnCo2O4 is demonstrated that mitigates the expansion issue and shows excellent performance at high current densities. The synthetic route is based on the pyrolysis of binary metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) with the controlled loss of zinc tuning the micro and nanostructure of the material through a thermal vapor mechanism. The optimal structures, that contain hollow Co3O4 spheres of ca. 50 nm diameter doped with ZnCo2O4, show a specific capacity of 890 mAh g\u22121 at a current rate of 0.1 A g\u22121 and show a similar specific capacity at 1 A g\u22121 after 120 cycles at high current densities. The kinetics of lithiation/delithiation changes from diffusion-controlled to a surface-controlled process by the nanosizing of the particles. The resultant faster ion diffusion and capacitive storage for lithium ions are responsible for the extraordinary high-rate performance of the hollow structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binary metal oxide doping", "Lithium storage", "metal organic frameworks", "Thermal vapor transport mechanism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binary metal oxides", "Electrical conductivity", "Lithiation/delithiation", "Lithium storages", "Metal organic framework", "Micro and nanostructures", "Surface-controlled process", "Thermal vapor transport"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047249157", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55498690000": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "55498690000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "8954805500": {"Name": "Aguadero A.", "AuthorID": "8954805500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "36991679000": {"Name": "Xie F.", "AuthorID": "36991679000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57213492423": {"Name": "Riley D.J.", "AuthorID": "57213492423", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57210372094": {"Name": "Ji K.", "AuthorID": "57210372094", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
