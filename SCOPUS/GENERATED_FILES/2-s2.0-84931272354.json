Properties such as intermittency and non-stationary clustering are common in earthquake time series such that multifractal concepts seem essential to describe the temporal clustering variability. Here we use a multifractal approach to study the time dynamics of the recent earthquake activity in the Corinth rift. The results indicate the degree of heterogeneous clustering and correlations acting at all time scales that suggest non-Poissonian behavior. Additionally, the multifractal analysis in different time periods showed that the degree of multifractality exhibits strong variations with time, which are associated with the dynamic evolution of the earthquake activity in the rift and the transition between periods of high and low seismicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic evolution", "Earthquake activity", "Intermittency", "Multi fractals", "Multifractal analysis", "Multifractality", "Nonstationary", "Temporal clustering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931272354", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56630487000": {"Name": "Michas G.", "AuthorID": "56630487000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "6603943658": {"Name": "Sammonds P.", "AuthorID": "6603943658", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "56264486500": {"Name": "Vallianatos F.", "AuthorID": "56264486500", "AffiliationID": "60032307", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Geophysics and Seismology, Technological Educational Institute of Crete"}}}
