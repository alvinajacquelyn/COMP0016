We optimized allotopic expression (nuclear transcription of a gene that is normally transcribed inside the mitochondria) aimed at designing a gene therapy for ND4; its coding sequence was associated with the cis-acting elements of the human COX10 mRNA to allow the efficient mitochondrial delivery of the protein. After ocular administration to adult rats of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector containing the human ND4 gene, we demonstrated that: (i) the sustained expression of human ND4 did not lead to harmful effects, instead the human protein is efficiently imported inside the mitochondria and assembled in respiratory chain complex I; (ii) the presence of the human protein in the experimental model of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy significantly prevents retinal ganglion cell degeneration and preserves both complex I function in optic nerves and visual function. Hence, the use of optimized allotopic expression is relevant for treating mitochondrial disorders due to mutations in the organelle genome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015172194", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"45961034900": {"Name": "Cwerman-Thibault H.", "AuthorID": "45961034900", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "24365912600": {"Name": "Augustin S.", "AuthorID": "24365912600", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "24168622600": {"Name": "Lechauve C.", "AuthorID": "24168622600", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "56723844300": {"Name": "Ayache J.", "AuthorID": "56723844300", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "24366055400": {"Name": "Ellouze S.", "AuthorID": "24366055400", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Sahel J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "6602186163": {"Name": "Corral-Debrinski M.", "AuthorID": "6602186163", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}}}
