Subsequently, concerns have been raised about the over treatment of patients following the diagnosis of localized prostate cancers. Cryotherapy, in which extremely low temperatures induce cell death via multiple mechanisms, has seen a drastic improvement in its technology since the 1800s. Such advances have improved oncological outcomes while reducing complication rates. Furthermore, technological advances have allowed the development of focal cryotherapy which aims to reduce morbidity associated with more radical whole-gland therapies. There is growing evidence that focal cryotherapy provides good oncological and morbidity rates when compared with traditional radical/whole-gland therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryoablation", "cryobiology", "cryoimmunology", "cryotherapy", "history", "prostate cancer", "technology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cryo ablations", "cryobiology", "cryoimmunology", "Localized prostate cancer", "Prostate cancers", "Prostate specific antigen", "Technological advances", "Technological aspects", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "Cryosurgery", "History, 19th Century", "History, 20th Century", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Selection", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923646632", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56414244100": {"Name": "Lau B.", "AuthorID": "56414244100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57114379700": {"Name": "Shah T.T.", "AuthorID": "57114379700", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Whittington Hospital"}, "35301144700": {"Name": "Valerio M.", "AuthorID": "35301144700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56530257500": {"Name": "Hamid S.", "AuthorID": "56530257500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
