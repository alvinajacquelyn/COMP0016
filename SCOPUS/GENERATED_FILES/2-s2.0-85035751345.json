The daily cycle of climate variation has a significant effect on urban airflow, and an understanding of it is very important for city-scale environmental control. A new and simple daily cycle temperature boundary condition for simulations of urban airflows with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is described herein. An analytical surface temperature formula was obtained after simplifying longwave radiation and sensible heat flux terms. The formula provides a reasonably good prediction of ground surface temperatures on sunny days without adding much complexity. The accuracy of the prediction of daily surface temperature variations in homogeneous soils was evaluated with a benchmark experiment and with weather station data. The new boundary condition was implemented in the commercial CFD software Fluent for a city-scale model. The implementation demonstrates the importance of including diurnal temperature profiles and atmospheric boundary conditions in CFD simulations of urban plumes in which an ideal urban heat island circulation occurs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Boundary layer", "Heat islands", "Urban meteorology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric boundary conditions", "Benchmark experiments", "Environmental control", "Ground surface temperature", "Heat island", "Surface temperature variation", "Urban heat island circulation", "Urban meteorology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035751345", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56548030300": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "56548030300", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57204521929": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57204521929", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "55547129784": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "55547129784", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "55216722000": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "55216722000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "35756335100": {"Name": "Chan P.", "AuthorID": "35756335100", "AffiliationID": "113100938", "AffiliationName": "Hong Kong Observatory"}}}
