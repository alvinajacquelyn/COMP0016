Methods: Systematic review of studies examining clinical predictors of lithium response was conducted. Meta-analyses were performed when \u22652 studies examined the same potential predictor. Results: A total of 71 studies, including over 12 000 patients, identified six predictors of good response: mania-depression-interval sequence [odds ratio (OR): 4.27; 95% CI: 2.61, 6.97; P < 0.001], absence of rapid cycling (OR for rapid cycling: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.53; P < 0.001), absence of psychotic symptoms (OR for psychotic symptoms: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.79; P = 0.002), family history of bipolar disorder (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.52; P = 0.036), shorter prelithium illness duration [standardised mean difference (SMD): \u22120.26; 95% CI: \u22120.41, \u22120.12; P < 0.001] and later age of onset (SMD: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.36; P = 0.029). Additionally, higher body mass index was associated with poor response in two studies (SMD: \u22120.61; 95% CI: \u22120.90, \u22120.32; P < 0.001). There was weak evidence for number of episodes prior to lithium treatment (SMD: \u22120.42; 95% CI: \u22120.84, \u22120.01; P = 0.046), number of hospitalisations before lithium (SMD: \u22120.40; 95% CI: \u22120.81, 0.01; P = 0.055) and family history of lithium response (OR: 10.28; 95% CI: 0.66, 161.26; P = 0.097). Conclusions: The relative importance of these clinical characteristics should be interpreted with caution because of potential biases and confounding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bipolar disorder", "clinical aspects", "lithium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antimanic Agents", "Bipolar Disorder", "Body Mass Index", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Lithium", "Lithium Compounds", "Male", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069049930", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57209908204": {"Name": "Hui T.P.", "AuthorID": "57209908204", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "57202786616": {"Name": "Kandola A.", "AuthorID": "57202786616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "57220983133": {"Name": "Shen L.", "AuthorID": "57220983133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.P.J.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "36518630100": {"Name": "Hayes J.F.", "AuthorID": "36518630100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "56883972800": {"Name": "Geddes J.R.", "AuthorID": "56883972800", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}}}
