In a large, nationally representative sample in the UK (the National Child Development Study), data were collected at birth, in childhood (age 11), adolescence (age 16), and adulthood (ages 33, 42, and 50) to examine the effects of family social background, childhood intelligence, school motivation during adolescence, education, and occupation on the personality trait Openness assessed at age 50 years. Structural equation modeling showed that parental social status, childhood intelligence, school motivation, education, and occupation all had modest, but direct, effects on trait Openness, among which childhood intelligence was the strongest predictor. Gender was not significantly associated with trait Openness. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education", "Gender", "Intelligence", "Openness", "Social class"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011665763", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical,Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55326183500": {"Name": "Cheng H.", "AuthorID": "55326183500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "ESRC Centre for Learning and Life Chances in Knowledge Economies and Societies, Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
