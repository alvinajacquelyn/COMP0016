MSA is unique in that the principal site for \u03b1-synuclein deposition is in the oligodendrocytes rather than neurons. The cause of MSA is unknown, and the pathogenesis of MSA is still largely speculative. Brain transcriptome perturbations during the onset and progression of MSA are mostly unknown. Using RNA sequencing, we performed a comparative transcriptome profiling analysis of the grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the frontal cortex of MSA and control brains. The transcriptome sequencing revealed increased expression of the alpha and beta haemoglobin genes in MSA WM, decreased expression of the transthyretin (TTR) gene in MSA GM and numerous region-specific long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). In contrast, we observed only moderate changes in the expression patterns of the \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) gene, which confirmed previous observations by other research groups. Our study suggests that at the transcriptional level, MSA pathology may be related to increased iron levels in WM and perturbations of the non-coding fraction of the transcriptome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Haemoglobin genes", "Long intervening non-coding RNA", "Multiple system atrophy", "Transcriptome sequencing", "White and grey matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "alpha-Synuclein", "Frontal Lobe", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925511071", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55530992700": {"Name": "Mills J.", "AuthorID": "55530992700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6602088325": {"Name": "Janitz M.", "AuthorID": "6602088325", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "25921389900": {"Name": "Kim W.", "AuthorID": "25921389900", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "35352763700": {"Name": "Halliday G.", "AuthorID": "35352763700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales"}}}
