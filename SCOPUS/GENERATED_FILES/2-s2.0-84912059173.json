Linear free energy relationships for tissues such as brain, muscle, liver, lung, kidney, heart, skin and fat are available and once the Abraham descriptors are known for a compound, no more than simple arithmetic is required to estimate air-tissue and blood-tissue partitions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham descriptors", "Air-tissue partition", "Blood-tissue partition", "Volatile organic compounds"], "IndexKeywords": ["Descriptors", "In-vitro", "In-vivo", "Linear free energy relationships", "Partition coefficient", "SIMPLE method", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Pesticides", "Skin", "Skin Absorption", "Tissue Distribution", "Toxicology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912059173", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6602753508": {"Name": "Gola J.M.R.", "AuthorID": "6602753508", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202978808": {"Name": "Ibrahim A.", "AuthorID": "7202978808", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "8626568900": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "8626568900", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Bradford"}}}
