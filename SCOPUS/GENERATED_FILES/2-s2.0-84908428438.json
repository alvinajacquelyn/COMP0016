All rights reserved.Nanoparticles are considered to be one of the most advanced tools for drug delivery applications. In this research, alginate (a model hydrophilic polymer) nanoparticles 80 to 200 nm in diameter were obtained using microbubble bursting. The natural process of bubble bursting occurs through a number of stages, which consequently produce nano- and microsized droplets via two main production mechanisms, bubble shell disintegration and a jetting process. In this study, nano-sized droplets/particles were obtained by promoting the disintegrating mechanism and suppressing (limiting) the formation of larger microparticles resulting from the jetting mechanism. A T-junction microfluidic device was used to prepare alginate microbubbles with different sizes in a well-controlled manner. The size of the bubbles was varied by controlling two processing parameters, the solution flow rate and the bubbling pressure. Crucially, the bubble size was found to be the determining factor for inducing (or limiting) the bubble shell disintegration mechanism and the size needed to promote this process was influenced by the properties of the solution used for preparing the bubbles, particularly the viscosity. The size of alginate nanoparticles produced via the disintegration mechanism was found to be directly proportional to the viscosity of the alginate solution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alginate", "Microbubbles", "Microfluidic", "Nanoparticles", "T-junction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Micro-bubble", "Microbubbles", "T junctions", "Alginates", "Glucuronic Acid", "Hexuronic Acids", "Microbubbles", "Microfluidic Analytical Techniques", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908428438", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57218392707": {"Name": "Elsayed M.", "AuthorID": "57218392707", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
