However, such research has potentially suffered from confounders present in between-country comparative research (e.g., latent cultural differences). Likewise, relatively little consideration has been given to whether the situation may be different for high- or low-performing students. Using five cycles of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) database, the current research explores within-country trajectories in achievement and inequality measures to test the hypothesis of an excellence/equity tradeoff in academic performance. We found negative relations between performance and inequality that are robust and of statistical and practical significance. Follow-up analysis suggests a focus on low and average performers may be critical to successful policy interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["achievement stratification", "cross-cultural comparisons", "educational inequality", "PISA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044922594", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"23470098500": {"Name": "Parker P.", "AuthorID": "23470098500", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Australian Catholic University"}, "7201585638": {"Name": "Marsh H.", "AuthorID": "7201585638", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Australian Catholic University"}, "56479534900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56479534900", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Australian Catholic University"}, "56007931200": {"Name": "Dicke T.", "AuthorID": "56007931200", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Australian Catholic University"}, "54418736800": {"Name": "Jerrim J.", "AuthorID": "54418736800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
