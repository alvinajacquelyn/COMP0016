KGaA, Weinheim.A new olivine composition (i.e., LiFe0.25Mn0.5Co0.25PO4) is proposed as electrode material with increased energy density for application in lithium-ion batteries. The new formulation increases the working voltage and induces different electrochemical behavior with respect to bare olivine materials based on Fe. The study provides deep insight into the features of the Fe3+/Fe2+, Mn3+/Mn2+, and Co3+/Co2+ redox couples within the olivine lattice in terms of electrochemical activity, Li+ transport properties, and Li-cell behavior. The electrochemical characterization clearly reveals the voltage signatures corresponding to the various metals; however, the Mn3+/Mn2+ process has higher intrinsic polarization with respect to Fe3+/Fe2+ and Co3+/Co2+. This issue is efficiently mitigated by carbon coating the material, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performances. Tune it up! A new olivine composition (LiFe0.25Mn0.5Co0.25PO4) is synthesized using a solvotermal approach and investigated for application in lithium-ion batteries. The carbon-coated material evidences the response of Fe3+/Fe2+, Mn3+/Mn2+, and Co3+/Co2+ redox couples. The presence of the various metals is reflected in a higher working voltage of the cathode.", "AuthorKeywords": ["batteries", "cathode", "energy density", "lithium-ion", "olivine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical activities", "Electrochemical behaviors", "Electrochemical characterizations", "Electrochemical performance", "Electrode material", "Energy density", "Lithium ions", "Olivine materials", "Electric Conductivity", "Electric Power Supplies", "Electrochemistry", "Electrodes", "Iron Compounds", "Lithium", "Magnesium Compounds", "Silicates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956595441", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56416532600": {"Name": "Di Lecce D.", "AuthorID": "56416532600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza University of Rome, Chemistry Department"}, "7102421480": {"Name": "Hassoun J.", "AuthorID": "7102421480", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "24502683600": {"Name": "Brescia R.", "AuthorID": "24502683600", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanochemistry, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "55192453300": {"Name": "Scarpellini A.", "AuthorID": "55192453300", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanochemistry, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "57208455894": {"Name": "Prato M.", "AuthorID": "57208455894", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanochemistry, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}}}
