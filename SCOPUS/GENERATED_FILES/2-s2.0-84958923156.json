In addition, key differences between filicide and non-filicide perpetrators were examined. Data were collected across a number of states and territories in Australia between 2010 and 2013 through interviews with 231 men and women convicted of murder or manslaughter. Of these participants, 14 had perpetrated filicide. Detailed information on the developmental background of the perpetrators, as well as motives and situational contexts of the homicide incidents, was gathered through the interviews. Findings from the current study reveal some important gender differences among filicide perpetrators. For example, filicidal fathers are more likely to perpetrate accidental filicide, and to report unemployment, alcohol and drug problems and previous engagement in child abuse, while filicidal mothers are more likely to perpetrate altruistic or neglectful filicide, and to report mental health problems. In addition, male filicide perpetrators report a greater number of adversities compared to male non-filicide perpetrators, while female filicide perpetrators display fewer adversities compared to their non-filicide counterparts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child murder", "Filicide", "Motivational classifications", "Non-filicide"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958923156", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55805428600": {"Name": "Eriksson L.", "AuthorID": "55805428600", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Griffith University"}, "57203126942": {"Name": "Mazerolle P.", "AuthorID": "57203126942", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Office of the Vice Chancellor (Arts, Education and Law), Griffith University"}, "6603079491": {"Name": "Wortley R.", "AuthorID": "6603079491", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute for Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "8125946600": {"Name": "Johnson H.", "AuthorID": "8125946600", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Criminology, University of Ottawa"}}}
