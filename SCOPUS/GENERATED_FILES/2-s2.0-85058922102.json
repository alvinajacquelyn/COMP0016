In many cases, resistance can be linked to genetic changes in target proteins, either pre-existing or evolutionarily selected during treatment. Key to overcoming this challenge is an understanding of the molecular determinants of drug binding. Using multi-stage pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain insights into the binding free energy and the residence time of a ligand, which can inform both stratified and personal treatment regimes and drug development. To support the scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High-throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block approach in order to attain both workflow flexibility and performance. Results: We demonstrate close to perfect weak scaling to hundreds of concurrent multi-stage binding affinity calculation pipelines. This permits a rapid time-to-solution that is essentially invariant of the calculation protocol, size of candidate ligands and number of ensemble simulations. Conclusions: As such, HTBAC advances the state of the art of binding affinity calculations and protocols. HTBAC provides the platform to enable scientists to study a wide range of cancer drugs and candidate ligands in order to support personalized clinical decision making based on genome sequencing and drug discovery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binding affinities", "Binding free energy", "Calculation protocols", "Clinical decision making", "Ensemble simulation", "High-performance computing resources", "Molecular determinants", "Molecular simulations", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Protein Binding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058922102", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57203225463": {"Name": "Dakka J.", "AuthorID": "57203225463", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University"}, "21834742300": {"Name": "Turilli M.", "AuthorID": "21834742300", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University"}, "57203220867": {"Name": "Balasubramanian V.", "AuthorID": "57203220867", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University"}, "24344078700": {"Name": "Jha S.", "AuthorID": "24344078700", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Computational Science Initiative, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "56673346700": {"Name": "Wright D.", "AuthorID": "56673346700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Sciences, UCL"}, "15046291200": {"Name": "Zasada S.", "AuthorID": "15046291200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Sciences, UCL"}, "7202726029": {"Name": "Wan S.", "AuthorID": "7202726029", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Sciences, UCL"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Sciences, UCL"}}}
