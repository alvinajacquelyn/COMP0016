Clean Delivery Kits (CDKs) promote clean delivery and neonatal care. Our qualitative research explores reasons for low CDK utilization, and describes community perceptions of CDKs in Nepal. Methods: We conducted 18 focus group discussions and 40 interviews with CDK users and nonusers, service providers, birth attendants, and household decision makers in 6 districts. We also conducted interviews with central level personnel. CDK users were aware of its benefits, and utilization was largely compatible with birth practices. Utilization was prevented by lack of awareness about the benefits and lack of availability. Participants believed that CDKs were for home use. Conclusion: Poor promotion of CDK is related to the disjuncture of promoting CDK use, while encouraging institutional deliveries. If CDKs are made available and marketed for use in households and health institutions, utilization may increase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child survival", "global health", "health communication", "health systems", "maternal and child health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Decision Making", "Delivery, Obstetric", "Equipment and Supplies", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Facilities", "Home Childbirth", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Mortality", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Midwifery", "Nepal", "Pregnancy", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926370542", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"9435917600": {"Name": "Morrison J.", "AuthorID": "9435917600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for International Health and Development, University College London"}, "56581597000": {"Name": "Jacoby C.", "AuthorID": "56581597000", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins Centre for Communication Programs"}, "56581633400": {"Name": "Ghimire S.", "AuthorID": "56581633400", "AffiliationID": "107942737", "AffiliationName": "Central Regional Health Direct.-Hetauda, Ministry of Health and Population"}, "56582333800": {"Name": "Oyloe P.", "AuthorID": "56582333800", "AffiliationID": "101524356", "AffiliationName": "Academy for Education and Development"}}}
