Our approach permits efficient sensitivity analysis concerning the posterior impact of priors on the partially identified component of the regression model. The new methodology is illustrated on an important problem where only partially observed data are available\u2014inferring the prevalence of accounting misconduct among publicly traded U.S. businesses.
