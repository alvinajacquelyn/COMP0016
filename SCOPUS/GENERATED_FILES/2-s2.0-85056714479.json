Here I examine Murrow and Murrow's suggestions about how identity-based hate speech bears responsibility for dehumanization in the first place. I identify a distinction between (i) accounts of the nature of the harm effected by identity prejudice, and (ii) accounts ofhowhate speech contributes to the harms of identity prejudice. I then explainwhy Murrow and Murrow's proposal is more aptly construed as an account of type (i), and explain why accounts of this type, even if they're plausible and evidentially well-supported, have limited implications in relation to justifications for anti-hate speech law.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dehumanization", "Hate speech", "Identity prejudice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056714479", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55500412300": {"Name": "Simpson R.", "AuthorID": "55500412300", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, Monash University"}}}
