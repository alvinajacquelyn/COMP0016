Existing systems typically use circular or rectangular coils built using inflexible wire and fixed into a rigid shape. This paper explores the design of receiver coils for wearable inductive power transfer. Our study demonstrates receive coil designs that visually embody patterns or logos do not significantly reduce receive voltage compared to a traditional wire loop of the same number of turns, giving designers flexibility over the appearance of wearable power transfer coils.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coil designs", "Existing systems", "Inductive power transfer", "Power transfers", "Receiver coil", "User intervention", "Wearable devices", "Wire loop"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964452742", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"56158143300": {"Name": "Worgan P.", "AuthorID": "56158143300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Doctoral Training in Communications, University of Bristol"}, "55973251700": {"Name": "Pappas O.", "AuthorID": "55973251700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Doctoral Training in Communications, University of Bristol"}, "57015514400": {"Name": "Omirou T.", "AuthorID": "57015514400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Doctoral Training in Communications, University of Bristol"}, "23476783300": {"Name": "Collett M.", "AuthorID": "23476783300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Doctoral Training in Communications, University of Bristol"}}}
