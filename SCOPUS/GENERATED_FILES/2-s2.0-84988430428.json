It has been hypothesized that ionophobic nanopores may create obstacles in charging, but they store energy much more efficiently than ionophilic pores. In this study, we find that, for both ionic liquids and organic electrolytes, an ionophobic pore exhibits a charging behavior different from that of an ionophilic pore, and that the capacitance-voltage curve changes from a bell shape to a two-hump camel shape when the pore ionophobicity increases. For electric-double-layer capacitors containing organic electrolytes, an increase in the ionophobicity of the nanopores leads to a higher capacity for energy storage. Without taking into account the effects of background screening, the DFT predicts that an ionophobic pore containing an ionic liquid does not enhance the supercapacitor performance within the practical voltage ranges. However, by using an effective dielectric constant to account for ion polarizability, the DFT predicts that, like an organic electrolyte, an ionophobic pore with an ionic liquid is also able to increase the energy stored when the electrode voltage is beyond a certain value. We find that the critical voltage for an enhanced capacitance in an ionic liquid is larger than that in an organic electrolyte. Our theoretical predictions provide further understanding of how chemical modification of porous electrodes affects the performance of supercapacitors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classical density functional theory", "electrical double layer", "energy storage", "ionophobic nanopore", "nonaqueous electrolytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacitance-voltage curve", "Charging behaviors", "Effective dielectric constants", "Electrical double layers", "Energy storage capacity", "Nanoporous electrode", "Non-aqueous electrolytes", "Organic electrolyte"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988430428", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55571313700": {"Name": "Lian C.", "AuthorID": "55571313700", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "34570619200": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "34570619200", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "57203272553": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57203272553", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "7402988756": {"Name": "Henderson D.", "AuthorID": "7402988756", "AffiliationID": "60006832", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Brigham Young University"}}}
