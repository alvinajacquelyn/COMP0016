The ESPR Strategic Research Agenda outlines our current research approach, highlighting several areas of paediatric imaging where the society can help guide current and future research, and emphasizing those areas where early research (\u201cseed\u201d) funding may need to be allocated by this and other societies as precursors to larger grant applications. The key aims are to evaluate normal variation in order to be able to confidently diagnose disease states, develop robust image-based classification systems to aid diagnosis and treatment monitoring, and help develop evidence-based clinical guidelines using current literature and experience to identify knowledge gaps. For this reason, the development of evidence-based imaging pipelines, broken down step-by-step to include diagnosis, classification and clinical effectiveness, should be the end goal for each disease entity for each affected child. Here, we outline the 2019 ESPR Strategic Research Agenda along three points in the clinical imaging pipeline: clinical referral, disease diagnosis and evolution, and clinical therapeutic evaluation and effectiveness. Through multicentre trials, using existing high-level experience and expertise, and nurturing the next generation of researchers, we will be able to achieve these aims.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guidelines", "Imaging", "Paediatric", "Research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Europe", "Female", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Safety", "Pediatrics", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Quality Improvement", "Radiation Protection", "Radiology", "Research Design", "Societies, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066131004", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "NIHR UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7003453510": {"Name": "van Rijn R.R.", "AuthorID": "7003453510", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60070178, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Emma Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "56240046000": {"Name": "Granata C.", "AuthorID": "56240046000", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Service of Radiology, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7007183777": {"Name": "Porto L.", "AuthorID": "7007183777", "AffiliationID": "60009308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Hospital of Goethe University"}, "7102856182": {"Name": "Hirsch F.W.", "AuthorID": "7102856182", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Radiology, University Leipzig"}, "55548497100": {"Name": "Rosendahl K.", "AuthorID": "55548497100", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen"}}}
