We combine these data with previous observations and investigate the dynamics and star formation properties of 17 lensed galaxies at 1 < z<4. Thanks to gravitational magnification of 1.4-90 times by foreground clusters, effective spatial resolutions of 40-700 pc are achieved. The magnification also allows us to probe lower star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses than unlensed samples; our target galaxies feature dust-corrected SFRs derived from H\u03b1 or H\u03b2 emission of ~0.8-40M<inf>\u2299</inf> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and stellar masses M<inf>*</inf> ~ 4 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup>-6 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> M<inf>\u2299</inf>. All of the galaxies show velocity gradients, with 59 per cent consistent with being rotating discs and a likely merger fraction of 29 per cent, with the remaining 12 per cent classed as 'undetermined'. We extract 50 star-forming clumps with sizes in the range 60 pc-1 kpc from the H\u03b1 (or H\u03b2) maps, and find that their surface brightnesses, \u03a3<inf>clump</inf> and their characteristic luminosities, L<inf>0</inf>, evolve to higher luminosities with redshift. We show that this evolution can be described by fragmentation on larger scales in gas-rich discs, and is likely to be driven by evolving gas fractions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: high-redshift", "Galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxies: star formation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930964376", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"44561338700": {"Name": "Livermore R.", "AuthorID": "44561338700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, The University of Texas at Austin"}, "7102858285": {"Name": "Bower R.", "AuthorID": "7102858285", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University"}, "55917471900": {"Name": "Swinbank A.", "AuthorID": "55917471900", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University"}, "7006400462": {"Name": "Edge A.", "AuthorID": "7006400462", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University"}, "7005932657": {"Name": "Smail I.", "AuthorID": "7005932657", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University"}, "7404294404": {"Name": "Jones T.", "AuthorID": "7404294404", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department, California Institute of Technology"}, "14627922300": {"Name": "Richard J.", "AuthorID": "14627922300", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60108269, 60012105", "AffiliationName": "CRAL, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Observatoire de Lyon"}, "35790821500": {"Name": "Yuan T.", "AuthorID": "35790821500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The Australian National University"}, "7003661500": {"Name": "Kewley L.", "AuthorID": "7003661500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The Australian National University"}, "22937171400": {"Name": "Coppin K.", "AuthorID": "22937171400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics, Science and Technology Research Institute, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7004978812": {"Name": "Ebeling H.", "AuthorID": "7004978812", "AffiliationID": "60013791, 60029042", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii"}}}
