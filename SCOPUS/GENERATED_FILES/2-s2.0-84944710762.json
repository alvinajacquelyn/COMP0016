In contrast to others who seek ways of adapting a system to students\u2019 specific learning style, our aim is to find ways of designing an ILE that encourages students\u2019 adoption of a deep approach to studying and discourages a surface approach. In this paper we focus only on the relationship between two subscales of the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (the deep subscale of interest in ideas and surface subscale of fear of failure), and metrics occurring from usage in a specific ILE. The results point to insights for instructors regarding the integration of ILEs in classrooms, as well as suggestions regarding the design of features which encourage a deep approach to studying.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep and surface approach to studying", "Entwistle\u2019s approaches and study skills inventory for students", "Fear of failure", "Intrinsic motivation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Interactive learning environment", "Intrinsic motivation", "Learning environments", "S-theory", "Specific learning", "Study skills", "Surface approach"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944710762", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"39561382000": {"Name": "Margeti M.", "AuthorID": "39561382000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Institute of Education"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Institute of Education"}}}
