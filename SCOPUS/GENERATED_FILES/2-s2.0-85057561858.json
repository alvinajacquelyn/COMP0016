In each case, the VO2 under-layer was deposited by electric field assisted AACVD on a fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass substrate, with the metal oxide top-layer deposited using sol-gel spin coating. The deposited films were analysed and characterised using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, variable temperature UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, glow discharge photoelectron emission spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. Compared to bare VO2 films, the bilayer films exhibit superior thermochromic properties, with dramatic increases in the visible light transmittance (Tvis), integrated luminous transmittance (Tlum) and solar modulation (\u0394Tsol). The thermochromic efficiency was also improved in some cases, with a reduction in the hysteresis loop width to ca. 10 \u00b0C, and a decrease in the transition temperature (Tc), which was as low as 44 \u00b0C and 43 \u00b0C for VO2/ZnO and VO2/SnO2 films, respectively. The best balance of thermochromic, thermal protection and aesthetic properties was achieved for ZnO coated films, with the VO2 under-layer deposited at a field strength of 1500 V m-1 under a negative DC bias (Tc = 47 \u00b0C, Tlum = 61.6%, Tvis = 68% and \u0394Tsol = 6%).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aesthetic property", "Fluorine doped tin oxide", "Photoelectron emission spectroscopies", "Sol-gel spin coating", "Thermal protection", "Thermochromic properties", "Variable temperature", "Visible light transmittances"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057561858", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57191442390": {"Name": "Top I.", "AuthorID": "57191442390", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7801602505": {"Name": "Binions R.", "AuthorID": "7801602505", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005656987": {"Name": "Abrahams I.", "AuthorID": "7005656987", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57188690319": {"Name": "Sol C.", "AuthorID": "57188690319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "33367844300": {"Name": "Holdynski M.", "AuthorID": "33367844300", "AffiliationID": "60030078, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "55778028000": {"Name": "Gaiaschi S.", "AuthorID": "55778028000", "AffiliationID": "119156421", "AffiliationName": "Horiba Scientific, Horiba France SAS"}}}
