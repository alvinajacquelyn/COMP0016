We used simultaneous interictal scalp EEG-fMRI to evaluate its value for predicting long-term postsurgical outcome. Methods: 30 patients undergoing presurgical evaluation and proceeding to temporal lobe (TL) resection were studied. Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were identified on intra-MRI EEG and used to build a model of haemodynamic changes. In addition, topographic electroencephalographic correlation maps were calculated between the average IED during video-EEG and intra-MRI EEG, and used as a condition. This allowed the analysis of all data irrespective of the presence of IED on intra-MRI EEG. Mean follow-up after surgery was 46 months. International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) outcomes 1 and 2 were considered good, and 3-6 poor, surgical outcome. Haemodynamic maps were classified according to the presence (Concordant) or absence (Discordant) of Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) change in the TL overlapping with the surgical resection. Results: The proportion of patients with good surgical outcome was significantly higher (13/16; 81%) in the Concordant than in the Discordant group (3/14; 21%) (\u03c72 test, Yates correction, p=0.003) and multivariate analysis showed that Concordant BOLD maps were independently related to good surgical outcome (p=0.007). Sensitivity and specificity of EEG-fMRI results to identify patients with good surgical outcome were 81% and 79%, respectively, and positive and negative predictive values were 81% and 79%, respectively. Interpretation: The presence of significant BOLD changes in the area of resection on interictal EEG-fMRI in patients with TLE retrospectively confirmed the epileptogenic zone. Surgical resection including regions of haemodynamic changes in the TL may lead to better postoperative outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Oxygen", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Preoperative Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Temporal Lobe", "Video Recording", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938149914", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6602404361": {"Name": "Coan A.", "AuthorID": "6602404361", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Neurology, University of Campinas"}, "55597926500": {"Name": "Campos B.", "AuthorID": "55597926500", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Neurology, University of Campinas"}, "35478909000": {"Name": "Cendes F.", "AuthorID": "35478909000", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Neurology, University of Campinas"}, "7004000093": {"Name": "Chaudhary U.", "AuthorID": "7004000093", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "56741534900": {"Name": "Perani S.", "AuthorID": "56741534900", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "55803571900": {"Name": "De Ciantis A.", "AuthorID": "55803571900", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "25640387400": {"Name": "Thornton R.", "AuthorID": "25640387400", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "21833806100": {"Name": "Grouiller F.", "AuthorID": "21833806100", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Medical Informatics, Geneva University Hospitals"}, "15842419100": {"Name": "Vulliemoz S.", "AuthorID": "15842419100", "AffiliationID": "60009963, 60004718", "AffiliationName": "EEG and Epilepsy Unit, Functional Brain Mapping Laboratory, Neurology Department, University Hospitals, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "55662216200": {"Name": "Beltramini G.", "AuthorID": "55662216200", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysics Group, Gleb Wataghin Physics Institute, University of Campinas"}, "6602832260": {"Name": "Covolan R.", "AuthorID": "6602832260", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysics Group, Gleb Wataghin Physics Institute, University of Campinas"}}}
