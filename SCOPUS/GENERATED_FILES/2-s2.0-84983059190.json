Indeed, an implicit assumption in one of the most influential theories in psychology, prospect theory, is that feelings govern choice. Surprisingly, however, very little is known about the rules by which feelings are transformed into decisions. Here, we specified a computational model that used feelings to predict choices. We found that this model predicted choice better than existing value-based models, showing a unique contribution of feelings to decisions, over and above value. Similar to the value function in prospect theory, our feeling function showed diminished sensitivity to outcomes as value increased. However, loss aversion in choice was explained by an asymmetry in how feelings about losses and gains were weighted when making a decision, not by an asymmetry in the feelings themselves. The results provide new insights into how feelings are utilized to reach a decision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["decision making", "feelings", "prospect theory", "subjective well-being", "utility", "value"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Decision Making", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983059190", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56134256200": {"Name": "Charpentier C.", "AuthorID": "56134256200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Affective Brain Lab, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "8501341500": {"Name": "Roiser J.", "AuthorID": "8501341500", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57190767918": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57190767918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Affective Brain Lab, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6506450367": {"Name": "Sharot T.", "AuthorID": "6506450367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Affective Brain Lab, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "37076945100": {"Name": "De Neve J.", "AuthorID": "37076945100", "AffiliationID": "60112746, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford"}}}
