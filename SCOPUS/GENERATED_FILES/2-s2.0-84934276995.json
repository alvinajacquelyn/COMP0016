This seems to be a departure from traditional equitable doctrine, which held that the beneficiary could falsify the trustee's unauthorised disbursement and bring a claim for an 'equitable debt'. This note considers the impact of the decision of the Supreme Court, and how the law regarding 'equitable compensation' might continue to develop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breach of trust", "Causation", "Equitable compensation", "Trustee's Liability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934276995", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57040359200": {"Name": "Davies P.", "AuthorID": "57040359200", "AffiliationID": "115392614", "AffiliationName": "Catherine's College"}}}
