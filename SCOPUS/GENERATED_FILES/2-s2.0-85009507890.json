All rights reserved.The identification of pathways connecting the cerebral cortex with subcortical structures is critical to understanding how large-scale brain networks operate. The cerebellum, for example, is known to project numerous axonal bundles to the cerebral cortex passing through the thalamus. This paper focuses on the technical details of cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway reconstruction using advanced diffusion MRI techniques in humans in vivo. Pathways reconstructed using seed/target placement on super-resolution maps, created with track density imaging (TDI), were compared with those reconstructed by defining regions of interest (ROIs) on non-diffusion weighted images (bO). We observed that the reconstruction of the pathways was more anatomically accurate when using ROIs placed on TDI rather than on bO maps, while inter-subject variability and reproducibility were similar between the two methods. Diffusion indices along pathways showed a position-dependent specificity that will need to be taken into consideration in future clinical investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway", "Constrained spherical deconvolution", "Diffusion MRI", "Super-resolution", "Track-density imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebellum", "Cerebral Cortex", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neural Pathways", "Reproducibility of Results", "Thalamus", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009507890", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37038201700": {"Name": "Palesi F.", "AuthorID": "37038201700", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Brain Connectivity Center, C.
