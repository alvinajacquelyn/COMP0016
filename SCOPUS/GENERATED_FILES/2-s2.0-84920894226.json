We perform the most comprehensive evaluation of the NCEP CFSR reanalysis model hourly wind speed hindcasts to date, and the first for the UK, by correlating the data against 264 onshore and 12 offshore synoptic weather stations, over a period of 30 years. The correlation of CFSR data to in situ measurements is similar to alternative approaches used in other studies both onshore and offshore. We investigate the impact of the topography, land use and mean wind speed on the onshore locations for the first time. The analysis of these spatial factors shows that CFSR represents the variety of terrain over UK well, and that the worst correlated sites are those at the highest elevations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["NCEP - CFSR", "Offshore", "Reanalysis", "Spatial", "Wind", "Wind - simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ncep-cfsr", "Offshore", "Reanalysis", "Spatial", "Wind simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920894226", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"56480200300": {"Name": "Sharp E.", "AuthorID": "56480200300", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "55224736800": {"Name": "Dodds P.", "AuthorID": "55224736800", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "12803419900": {"Name": "Barrett M.", "AuthorID": "12803419900", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}}}
