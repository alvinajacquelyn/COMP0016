The effectiveness of such applications is improved using engineered enzymes that to date have been constructed using amino acid substitutions. We describe \u0394Flucs: consecutive single amino acid deletion mutants within six loop structures of the bright and thermostable \u00d711 Fluc. Deletion mutations are a promising avenue to explore new sequence and functional space and isolate novel mutant phenotypes. However, this method is often overlooked and to date there have been no surveys of the effects of consecutive single amino acid deletions in Fluc. We constructed a large semi-rational \u0394Fluc library and isolated significantly brighter enzymes after finding \u00d711 Fluc activity was largely tolerant to deletions. Targeting an \u201comega-loop\u201d motif (T352-G360) significantly enhanced activity, altered kinetics, reduced Km for D-luciferin, altered emission colors, and altered substrate specificity for redshifted analog DL-infraluciferin. Experimental and in silico analyses suggested remodeling of the \u03a9-loop impacts on active site hydrophobicity to increase light yields. This work demonstrates the further potential of deletion mutations, which can generate useful Fluc mutants and broaden the palette of the biomedical and biotechnological bioluminescence enzyme toolbox.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioimaging", "bioluminescence", "bioreporter", "deletion mutagenesis", "firefly luci ferase", "infraluciferi"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bio-imaging", "bioreporter", "Deletion mutagenesis", "firefly luci ferase", "infraluciferi", "Amino Acids", "Animals", "Fireflies", "Gene Library", "Kinetics", "Luciferases, Firefly", "Luminescence", "Models, Molecular", "Mutant Proteins", "Protein Conformation", "Sequence Deletion", "Substrate Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035045726", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56204206500": {"Name": "Halliwell L.M.", "AuthorID": "56204206500", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff"}, "36740260600": {"Name": "Jathoul A.P.", "AuthorID": "36740260600", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff"}, "57197812996": {"Name": "Bate J.P.", "AuthorID": "57197812996", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff"}, "57191281022": {"Name": "Worthy H.L.", "AuthorID": "57191281022", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff"}, "55492029500": {"Name": "Jones D.D.", "AuthorID": "55492029500", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff"}, "35552061200": {"Name": "Murray J.A.H.", "AuthorID": "35552061200", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff"}, "55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.C.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
