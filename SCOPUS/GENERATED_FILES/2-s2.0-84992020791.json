This holds true for almost any standard technique, whereas the intentional separation of educts is considered to be restricted to a very limited number of cases. Here we show that single crystals of \u03b1-Li2IrO3 can be grown from separated educts in an open crucible in air. Elemental lithium and iridium are oxidized and transported over a distance of typically one centimeter. In contrast to classical vapor transport, the process is essentially isothermal and a temperature gradient of minor importance. Single crystals grow from an exposed condensation point placed in between the educts. The method has also been applied to the growth of Li2RuO3, Li2PtO3 and \u03b2-Li2IrO3. A successful use of this simple and low cost technique for various other materials is anticipated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992020791", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56421821300": {"Name": "Freund F.", "AuthorID": "56421821300", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "EP VI, Center for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism, Augsburg University"}, "56186621100": {"Name": "Gegenwart P.", "AuthorID": "56186621100", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "EP VI, Center for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism, Augsburg University"}, "24802192800": {"Name": "Jesche A.", "AuthorID": "24802192800", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "EP VI, Center for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism, Augsburg University"}, "57008549700": {"Name": "Williams S.C.", "AuthorID": "57008549700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55838510124": {"Name": "Johnson R.D.", "AuthorID": "55838510124", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "57197085987": {"Name": "Coldea R.", "AuthorID": "57197085987", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
