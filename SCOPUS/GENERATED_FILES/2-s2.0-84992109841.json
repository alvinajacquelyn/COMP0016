Current cytometry-based approaches are limited to the simultaneous screening of 10-100 distinct T-cell specificities in one sample. Here we use peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers labeled with individual DNA barcodes to screen >1,000 peptide specificities in a single sample, and detect low-frequency CD8 T cells specific for virus- or cancer-restricted antigens. When analyzing T-cell recognition of shared melanoma antigens before and after adoptive cell therapy in melanoma patients, we observe a greater number of melanoma-specific T-cell populations compared with cytometry-based approaches. Furthermore, we detect neoepitope-specific T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Barcode-labeled pMHC multimers enable the combination of functional T-cell analysis with large-scale epitope recognition profiling for the characterization of T-cell recognition in various diseases, including in small clinical samples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell populations", "Clinical samples", "Low-frequency", "Major histocompatibility complex", "Non small cell lung cancer", "Peripheral blood", "Single sample", "T cell recognition", "Antigens", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cells, Cultured", "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic", "Genes, MHC Class I", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Peptides", "Protein Multimerization", "Staining and Labeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992109841", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57191615192": {"Name": "Bentzen A.K.", "AuthorID": "57191615192", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "36698145000": {"Name": "Lyngaa R.", "AuthorID": "36698145000", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57202467983": {"Name": "Saini S.K.", "AuthorID": "57202467983", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57188690553": {"Name": "Ramskov S.", "AuthorID": "57188690553", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57191621396": {"Name": "Such L.", "AuthorID": "57191621396", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57191625228": {"Name": "Jakobsen S.N.", "AuthorID": "57191625228", "AffiliationID": "108066023", "AffiliationName": "Immudex"}, "12143419700": {"Name": "Hadrup S.R.", "AuthorID": "12143419700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "56950920700": {"Name": "Marquard A.M.", "AuthorID": "56950920700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57203030767": {"Name": "Szallasi Z.", "AuthorID": "57203030767", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "8057455300": {"Name": "Eklund A.C.", "AuthorID": "8057455300", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "23982021500": {"Name": "Donia M.", "AuthorID": "23982021500", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60017814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "55665004600": {"Name": "Straten P.T.", "AuthorID": "55665004600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004436719": {"Name": "Svane I.M.", "AuthorID": "7004436719", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60017814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "55927166800": {"Name": "Furness A.J.S.", "AuthorID": "55927166800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "54956605300": {"Name": "McGranahan N.", "AuthorID": "54956605300", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Translational Cancer Therapeutics Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57150146000": {"Name": "Rosenthal R.", "AuthorID": "57150146000", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Translational Cancer Therapeutics Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7005912775": {"Name": "Swanton C.", "AuthorID": "7005912775", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Translational Cancer Therapeutics Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "12762916100": {"Name": "Quezada S.A.", "AuthorID": "12762916100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
