There is no consensus definition of agitation and no widespread agreement on what elements should be included in the syndrome. The International Psychogeriatric Association formed an Agitation Definition Work Group (ADWG) to develop a provisional consensus definition of agitation in patients with cognitive disorders that can be applied in epidemiologic, non-interventional clinical, pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic interventional, and neurobiological studies. A consensus definition will facilitate communication and cross-study comparison and may have regulatory applications in drug development programs. Methods: The ADWG developed a transparent process using a combination of electronic, face-to-face, and survey-based strategies to develop a consensus based on agreement of a majority of participants. Nine-hundred twenty-eight respondents participated in the different phases of the process. Results: Agitation was defined broadly as: (1) occurring in patients with a cognitive impairment or dementia syndrome; (2) exhibiting behavior consistent with emotional distress; (3) manifesting excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression; and (4) evidencing behaviors that cause excess disability and are not solely attributable to another disorder (psychiatric, medical, or substance-related). A majority of the respondents rated all surveyed elements of the definition as strongly agree or somewhat agree (68-88% across elements). A majority of the respondents agreed that the definition is appropriate for clinical and research applications. Conclusions: A provisional consensus definition of agitation has been developed. This definition can be used to advance interventional and non-interventional research of agitation in patients with cognitive impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggression", "agitation", "Alzheimer's disease", "clinical trials", "cognitive impairment", "epidemiology", "Food and Drug Administration", "International Psychogeriatric Association", "intervention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Behavioral Symptoms", "Cognition Disorders", "Dementia", "Disease Management", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychomotor Agitation", "Terminology as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927697456", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402590824": {"Name": "Cummings J.", "AuthorID": "7402590824", "AffiliationID": "109639990", "AffiliationName": "ClevelandClinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health"}, "55549523600": {"Name": "Zhong K.", "AuthorID": "55549523600", "AffiliationID": "109639990", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health"}, "7004465607": {"Name": "Mintzer J.", "AuthorID": "7004465607", "AffiliationID": "114786444", "AffiliationName": "Roper St. Francis Hospital, Clinical Biotechnology Research Institute"}, "7005329283": {"Name": "Brodaty H.", "AuthorID": "7005329283", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Brain Ageing, University of New South Wales"}, "56393860500": {"Name": "Sano M.", "AuthorID": "56393860500", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Mount Sinai School of Medicine"}, "7404539568": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "7404539568", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Trafford Centre for Medical Research, University of Sussex"}, "35370379500": {"Name": "Devanand D.P.", "AuthorID": "35370379500", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "57202477003": {"Name": "Gauthier S.", "AuthorID": "57202477003", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60028492", "AffiliationName": "McGill Center for Studies in Aging, Douglas Mental Health University Institute Montreal"}, "34769841900": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "34769841900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College of London"}, "7003916943": {"Name": "Lanct\u00f4t K.", "AuthorID": "7003916943", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60029150", "AffiliationName": "Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto"}, "6601923472": {"Name": "Lyketsos C.G.", "AuthorID": "6601923472", "AffiliationID": "60030952, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"}, "7005757363": {"Name": "Peskind E.", "AuthorID": "7005757363", "AffiliationID": "60031866", "AffiliationName": "VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Columbian Way"}, "6603579985": {"Name": "Porsteinsson A.P.", "AuthorID": "6603579985", "AffiliationID": "60024848", "AffiliationName": "Monroe Community Hospital"}, "56432356000": {"Name": "Reich E.", "AuthorID": "56432356000", "AffiliationID": "60001563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Hospital Julio Mendez, University of Buenos Aires"}, "35228015300": {"Name": "Sampaio C.", "AuthorID": "35228015300", "AffiliationID": "60096697", "AffiliationName": "CHDI Foundation"}, "7006300689": {"Name": "Steffens D.", "AuthorID": "7006300689", "AffiliationID": "60000209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Connecticut Health Center"}, "25523027400": {"Name": "Wortmann M.", "AuthorID": "25523027400", "AffiliationID": "100393328", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease International"}}}
