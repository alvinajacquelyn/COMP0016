Brain Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society of NeuropathologyMultinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) is a new pattern of neuronal tumour included in the recently revised WHO 2016 classification of tumors of the CNS. There are 15 reports in the literature to date. They are typically associated with late onset epilepsy and a neoplastic vs. malformative biology has been questioned. We present a series of ten cases and compare their pathological and genetic features to better characterized epilepsy-associated malformations including focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) and low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors (LEAT). Clinical and neuroradiology data were reviewed and a broad immunohistochemistry panel was applied to explore neuronal and glial differentiation, interneuronal populations, mTOR pathway activation and neurodegenerative changes. Next generation sequencing was performed for targeted multi-gene analysis to identify mutations common to epilepsy lesions including FCDII and LEAT. All of the surgical cases in this series presented with seizures, and were located in the temporal lobe. There was a lack of any progressive changes on serial pre-operative MRI and a mean age at surgery of 45 years. The vacuolated cells of the lesion expressed mature neuronal markers (neurofilament/SMI32, MAP2, synaptophysin). Prominent labelling of the lesional cells for developmentally regulated proteins (OTX1, TBR1, SOX2, MAP1b, CD34, GFAP\u03b4) and oligodendroglial lineage markers (OLIG2, SMI94) was observed. No mutations were detected in the mTOR pathway genes, BRAF, FGFR1 or MYB. Clinical, pathological and genetic data could indicate that MVNT aligns more with a malformative lesion than a true neoplasm with origin from a progenitor neuro-glial cell type showing aberrant maturation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epilepsy", "Multinodular", "neuronal", "tumour", "vacuolating"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Differentiation", "Child", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Malformations of Cortical Development, Group I", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasms, Nerve Tissue", "Neuroglia", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030110639", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7004423623": {"Name": "Thom M.", "AuthorID": "7004423623", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy and Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36056919800": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "36056919800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy and Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15925796300": {"Name": "Paradiso B.", "AuthorID": "15925796300", "AffiliationID": "60000160", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Pathology Unit, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences University of Padua Medical School"}, "56091577100": {"Name": "Reeves C.", "AuthorID": "56091577100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy and Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55201515800": {"Name": "Somani A.", "AuthorID": "55201515800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy and Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7203025138": {"Name": "An S.", "AuthorID": "7203025138", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy and Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "53363960100": {"Name": "Marsdon D.", "AuthorID": "53363960100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy and Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57195370985": {"Name": "Bongaarts A.", "AuthorID": "57195370985", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center"}, "55612875000": {"Name": "Reinten R.J.", "AuthorID": "55612875000", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center"}, "7005153143": {"Name": "Aronica E.", "AuthorID": "7005153143", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "26642970600": {"Name": "J\u00e4ger H.R.", "AuthorID": "26642970600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiological Academic Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57215499053": {"Name": "Miserocchi A.", "AuthorID": "57215499053", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005963244": {"Name": "Thorne L.", "AuthorID": "7005963244", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57195918213": {"Name": "Newman F.", "AuthorID": "57195918213", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals"}, "6602644499": {"Name": "Bucur S.", "AuthorID": "6602644499", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals"}, "57189198429": {"Name": "Honavar M.", "AuthorID": "57189198429", "AffiliationID": "60014749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital Pedro Hispano"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neuropathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
