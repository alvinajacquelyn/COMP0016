The inclusion of zero-point energy leads to two different possible dissociations of H2S, namely 3H2S\u21922H3S+S and 5H2S\u21923H3S+HS2, where both H3S and HS2 are metallic. For H3S, we perform nonperturbative calculations of anharmonic effects within the self-consistent harmonic approximation and show that the harmonic approximation strongly overestimates the electron-phonon interaction (\u03bb\u22482.64 at 200 GPa) and Tc. Anharmonicity hardens HS bond-stretching modes and softens HS bond-bending modes. As a result, the electron-phonon coupling is suppressed by 30% (\u03bb\u22481.84 at 200 GPa). Moreover, while at the harmonic level Tc decreases with increasing pressure, the inclusion of anharmonicity leads to a Tc that is almost independent of pressure.
