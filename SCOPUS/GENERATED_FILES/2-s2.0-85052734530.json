The influence of genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway resulting in susceptibility to upper respiratory infections (URI) has not been investigated. We evaluated the influence of thirty-three SNP in eleven vitamin D pathway genes (DBP, DHCR7, RXRA, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, CYP3A4, CYP27A1, LRP2, CUBN and VDR) resulting in URI risk in 725 adults in London, UK, using an additive model with adjustment for potential confounders and correction for multiple comparisons. Significant associations in this cohort were investigated in a validation cohort of 737 children in Manchester, UK. In all, three SNP in VDR (rs4334089, rs11568820 and rs7970314) and one SNP in CYP3A4 (rs2740574) were associated with risk of URI in the discovery cohort after adjusting for potential confounders and correcting for multiple comparisons (adjusted incidence rate ratio per additional minor allele \u22651\u00b715, P for trend \u22640\u00b7030). This association was replicated for rs4334089 in the validation cohort (P for trend=0\u00b7048) but not for rs11568820, rs7970314 or rs2740574. Carriage of the minor allele of the rs4334089 SNP in VDR was associated with increased susceptibility to URI in children and adult cohorts in the United Kingdom.", "AuthorKeywords": ["SNP", "Upper respiratory infection", "Vitamin D receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cytokines", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptors, Calcitriol", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Virus Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052734530", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55535210400": {"Name": "Jolliffe D.A.", "AuthorID": "55535210400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55981268300": {"Name": "Greiller C.L.", "AuthorID": "55981268300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.J.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60111945, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57205110046": {"Name": "Walton R.T.", "AuthorID": "57205110046", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6701779026": {"Name": "Martineau A.R.", "AuthorID": "6701779026", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60111945, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6603586476": {"Name": "Mein C.A.", "AuthorID": "6603586476", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Genome Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36484798800": {"Name": "Hoti M.", "AuthorID": "36484798800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "55235106600": {"Name": "Bakhsoliani E.", "AuthorID": "55235106600", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "36959745400": {"Name": "Telcian A.G.", "AuthorID": "36959745400", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7401781716": {"Name": "Johnston S.L.", "AuthorID": "7401781716", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60002517", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, Imperial College London"}, "7402780427": {"Name": "Simpson A.", "AuthorID": "7402780427", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Medicine and Health University of Manchester"}, "7101961514": {"Name": "Curtin J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101961514", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Medicine and Health University of Manchester"}, "57203032627": {"Name": "Barnes N.C.", "AuthorID": "57203032627", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60111945, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006755479": {"Name": "Custovic A.", "AuthorID": "7006755479", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College London"}}}
