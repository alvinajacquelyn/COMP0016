Lithic evidence suggests that the know-how of shrub clearing and cereal harvesting by using particular types of stone tools was transmitted to Egypt from the southern Levant in the early-middle 6th millennium BC. On the other hand, lithic evidence also suggests that people in Egypt had to protect farmland and livestock from local predators by developing new weapons, with which no comparable weapons are known in the Levant. From a viewpoint of lithic study, it can be argued that the beginning and development of cereal cultivating and livestock keeping in Egypt were definitely the construction of an ecological niche suitable for Southwest Asian domesticates by means of lithic technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Egypt", "Farming", "Fayum", "Neolithic", "Southwest Asia", "Stone tool"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958559451", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"57125686500": {"Name": "Shirai N.", "AuthorID": "57125686500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
