The current objective is to create and establish the content validity of a new stand-alone version of the measure, the Penn-FPS-Revised (Penn-FPS-R). Methods: Twenty participants (15 USA and 5 UK) with confirmed TN engaged in concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews. These semi-structured interviews allowed participants to spontaneously describe the ways in which TN impacts on HRQoL and report on the extent to which the Penn-FPS and BPI-PII measure concepts are most relevant to them. Participants were also asked to report on the suitability of the instructions, recall period, and response options. Results: Concept elicitation revealed nine themes involving TN restrictions on daily activities and HRQoL, including: \u201ctalking,\u201d \u201cself-care,\u201d \u201ceating,\u201d \u201ceating hard foods/chewing foods,\u201d \u201cdaily activities,\u201d \u201cactivities with temperature change,\u201d \u201ctouching,\u201d \u201cmood,\u201d and \u201crelationships.\u201d Cognitive debriefing confirmed that all of the Penn-FPS concepts and some of the BPI-PII concepts (\u201cmood,\u201d \u201cgeneral activities,\u201d and \u201crelations with others\u201d) were relevant, although some items required edits to better capture individuals\u2019 experiences. The impact of temperature and/ or weather on activities was also identified as an important concept that is not captured by the Penn-FPS or BPI-PII. Participants confirmed the acceptability of recall period, instructions, and response options. Results from the interviews were applied to create the Penn-FPS-R, a new brief outcome measure that assesses the impacts of TN most important to patients. Conclusion: The Penn-FPS-R is a new 12-item HRQoL outcome measure with content validity that can be used to assess and monitor the impact of TN treatment interventions in both clinical practice and research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive debriefing", "Concept elicitation", "Content validity", "Patient reported outcome", "Penn Facial Pain Scale", "PRO development", "Trigeminal neuralgia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048674153", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"6602566830": {"Name": "Symonds T.", "AuthorID": "6602566830", "AffiliationID": "114996497", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Outcomes Solutions, Clinical Outcome Assessments"}, "57193445040": {"Name": "Randall J.A.", "AuthorID": "57193445040", "AffiliationID": "114996497", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Outcomes Solutions, Clinical Outcome Assessments"}, "57210742257": {"Name": "Hoffman D.L.", "AuthorID": "57210742257", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen Inc"}, "7006163624": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006163624", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital - University College London Hospitals, Division of Diagnostic, Surgical and Medical Sciences"}, "57202536315": {"Name": "Gehringer W.", "AuthorID": "57202536315", "AffiliationID": "115328525", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Outcomes Solutions"}, "57190386875": {"Name": "Lee J.Y.K.", "AuthorID": "57190386875", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine"}}}
