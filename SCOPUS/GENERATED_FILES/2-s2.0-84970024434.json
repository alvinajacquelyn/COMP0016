In addition to mature miRNAs, precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) have also been shown to localize to somatodendritic and axonal compartments. miRNA-338 (miR-338) regulates the local expression of several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs within axons of sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that precursor miR-338 (pre-miR-338) introduced into the axon can locally be processed into mature miR-338, where it can regulate local ATP synthesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the localization of pre-miRNAs to the axonal compartment remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the axonal localization of pre-miR-338. Using proteomic and biochemical approaches, we provide evidence for the localization of pre-miR-338 to distal neuronal compartments and identify several constituents of the pre-miR-338 ribonucleoprotein complex. Furthermore, we found that pre-miR-338 is associated with the mitochondria in axons of superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. The maintenance of mitochondrial function within axons requires the precise spatiotemporal synthesis of nuclear-encoded mRNAs, some of which are regulated by miR-338. Therefore, the association of pre-miR-338 with axonal mitochondria could serve as a reservoir of mature, biologically active miRNAs, which could coordinate the intra-axonal expression of multiple nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Local translation", "Mitochondrial translation", "Post-transcriptional regulation", "Proteomics", "RNP granule", "Subcellular localization", "Superior cervical ganglion", "Sympathetic neuron"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "MicroRNAs", "Mitochondria", "Protein Binding", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Ribonuclease III", "RNA Precursors", "RNA Transport", "Superior Cervical Ganglion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970024434", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57189378175": {"Name": "Vargas J.N.S.", "AuthorID": "57189378175", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "14121590400": {"Name": "Kar A.N.", "AuthorID": "14121590400", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "57218844263": {"Name": "Gale J.R.", "AuthorID": "57218844263", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "6506763933": {"Name": "Aschrafi A.", "AuthorID": "6506763933", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "37046534500": {"Name": "Chen C.Y.", "AuthorID": "37046534500", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "6603027121": {"Name": "Gioio A.E.", "AuthorID": "6603027121", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "7402532346": {"Name": "Kaplan B.B.", "AuthorID": "7402532346", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Section on Neurobiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "6603786790": {"Name": "Kowalak J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603786790", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577, 60003158", "AffiliationName": "NINDS/NIMH Clinical Proteomics Unit, Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institutes of Health"}}}
