Devices exhibit low electroforming voltages (typically \u2212 2.6 V), low switching voltages (\u00b1 1 V for setting and resetting), excellent endurance of > 107 switching cycles, good state retention (at room temperature and after 1 h at 260 \u00b0C), and narrow distributions of switching voltages and resistance states. We analyse the microstructure of amorphous silicon oxide films and postulate that columnar growth, which results from sputter-deposition of the oxide on rough surfaces, enhances resistance switching behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intrinsic", "ReRAM", "Resistance switching", "Silicon oxide", "STEM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bipolar resistance switching", "Intrinsic", "Intrinsic resistance", "Narrow distribution", "Resistance state", "Resistance switching", "Resistance switching behaviors", "Switching voltages"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018860332", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55236732600": {"Name": "Mehonic A.", "AuthorID": "55236732600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56500426600": {"Name": "Munde M.", "AuthorID": "56500426600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56386662300": {"Name": "Ng W.", "AuthorID": "56386662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56500553700": {"Name": "Buckwell M.", "AuthorID": "56500553700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56500320100": {"Name": "Montesi L.", "AuthorID": "56500320100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007004212": {"Name": "Bosman M.", "AuthorID": "7007004212", "AffiliationID": "60030743", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering"}}}
