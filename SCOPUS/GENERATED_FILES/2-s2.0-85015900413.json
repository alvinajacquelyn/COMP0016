Three different Combined Heat and Power systems, such as fuel cells, Stirling engine and micro gas turbine, installed at household level are assessed in two different settings: one in Northern Europe (UK) and one in Southern Europe (Italy). Different operating strategies are investigated for each technology. Moreover, marginal electricity production technologies are analysed to assess their influence on the results. This study has demonstrated that the type of bio-methane fed micro-CHP technology employed has a significantly different environmental impact: fuel cells are the most environmentally friendly solution in every category analysed; Stirling engines, although can supply heat to the largest number of dwellings are the least environmentally friendly technology. However, key factors investigated in the model presented in this paper influence the decision making on the type of technology adopted and the operating strategy to be implemented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomethane", "Distributed generation", "Food waste", "Life cycle assessment", "micro-CHP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomethane", "Combined heat and power system", "Distributed energies", "Environmentally-friendly technology", "Food waste", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Marginal electricities", "Micro-CHP", "Biofuels", "Conservation of Energy Resources", "Environment", "Europe", "Italy", "Methane"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015900413", "SubjectAreas": [["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"]], "AuthorData": {"54966700100": {"Name": "Evangelisti S.", "AuthorID": "54966700100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "55845455200": {"Name": "Tagliaferri C.", "AuthorID": "55845455200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7101769541": {"Name": "Clift R.", "AuthorID": "7101769541", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Strategy, The University of Surrey"}}}
