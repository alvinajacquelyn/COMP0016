However, with their vast use, development of resistance has become more prevalent and their use is currently under threat. Antibiotic resistance poses a global threat to human and animal health, with many bacterial species having developed some form of resistance and in some cases within a year of first exposure to antimicrobial agents. This review aims to examine some of the mechanisms behind resistance. Additionally, re-engineering organisms, re-sensitizing bacteria to antibiotics and gene-editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 system are providing novel approaches to combat bacterial resistance. To that extent, we have reviewed some of these novel and innovative technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibiotics", "antimicrobial resistance", "infectious agents", "molecular biology", "re-sensitizing", "resistance mechanisms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062540407", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"]], "AuthorData": {"57203238057": {"Name": "Ali J.", "AuthorID": "57203238057", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Biological Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "36920226800": {"Name": "Ratcliffe E.", "AuthorID": "36920226800", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Biological Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "55588691900": {"Name": "Rafiq Q.", "AuthorID": "55588691900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
