A series of workshops on \"Nonlinear Waves and Chaos\" have been held to discuss this subject in Kyoto, Japan (1994), Cologne, Germany (1997), Carlsbad, USA (1999), Troms\u00f8, Norway (2001), Mumbai, India (2003), Fukuoka, Japan (2006), Beaulieu-sur-Mer, France (2008), and La Jolla, USA (2010, 2013). The 10th International Nonlinear Waves and Chaos Workshop 2017 (NWCW17) was held in San Diego, California, from 20 to 24 March 2017. This workshop was unique because it brought together 34 experts, including space, laboratory, and fusion plasma physicists, astrophysicists, applied mathematicians, atmospheric and oceanic scientists, and even a heart specialist, from various countries. Since nonlinear waves, chaos, dispersion, and dissipation occur in many fields of natural and biological sciences, it is therefore desirable to compare theoretical approaches and observational techniques from various disciplines. This workshop provided an opportunity to report on the latest results from theory, simulation, and data analysis dealing with the nonlinear processes and complex system dynamics in space, laboratory, and astrophysical plasmas as well as rogue ocean waves and cardiac arrhythmia. This special issue of Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics (NPG) consists of papers drawn from the talks given at the NWCW 2017 as well as papers that were submitted in response to the call for papers for this special issue. All papers had to undergo the usual NPG review process before they were finally accepted for this special issue. The papers in this special issue cover a broad range of topics related to nonlinear waves and chaos. These include intermittent turbulence in the heliosheath and magnetosheath plasmas, the evolution of fractality in magnetized plasmas, a lifetime estimate for solar wind plasma turbulence, the statistical origin of kappa distributions in space plasmas, the application of a dynamical system approach to study extremes of northern hemispheric climate fields over the past 60 years, an application of wavelet decomposition and reconstruction techniques to find correlations between Earth's auroral electrojet (AE) index and ACE solar wind magnetic data for predicting geomagnetic activity, and estimates of satellite drag effects due to uplifted oxygen neutral atoms during super magnetic storms. A brief summary of the special issue papers is given below. Livadiotis (2018) presents results on the statistical origin of kappa distributions, which describe velocities and energies of electrons and ions in space plasmas, in terms of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The kappa distribution can be derived by maximizing the q-entropy of Tsallis under the constraints of a canonical ensemble. However, the physical origin of this entropic formulation is not known. This paper shows that the q-entropy can be derived by adapting the additivity of energy and entropy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049246056", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"7006414754": {"Name": "Lakhina G.S.", "AuthorID": "7006414754", "AffiliationID": "60018641", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, New Panvel (W)"}, "7004788617": {"Name": "Tsurutani B.T.", "AuthorID": "7004788617", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "7102711643": {"Name": "Morales G.J.", "AuthorID": "7102711643", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, University of California Los Angeles"}, "57207613327": {"Name": "Pouquet A.", "AuthorID": "57207613327", "AffiliationID": "60015590", "AffiliationName": "UCAR"}, "7202079996": {"Name": "Hoshino M.", "AuthorID": "7202079996", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Physics, University of Tokyo"}, "35510891600": {"Name": "Alejandro Valdivia J.", "AuthorID": "35510891600", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Fisica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Chile"}, "55872622800": {"Name": "Narita Y.", "AuthorID": "55872622800", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
