Moreover, a number of promising pre-clinical interventions have failed to translate into clinical efficacy in humans. Improved treatments are unlikely without better animal-human translational pipelines. Here, we translate a rodent measure of negative affective bias into humans, exploring its relationship with (1) pathological mood and anxiety symptoms and (2) transient induced anxiety.Methods Adult participants (age = 29 \u00b1 11) who met criteria for mood or anxiety disorder symptomatology according to a face-to-face neuropsychiatric interview were included in the symptomatic group. Study 1 included N = 77 (47 = asymptomatic [female = 21]; 30 = symptomatic [female = 25]), study 2 included N = 47 asymptomatic participants (25 = female). Outcome measures were choice ratios, reaction times and parameters recovered from a computational model of reaction time-the drift diffusion model (DDM)-from a two-alternative-forced-choice task in which ambiguous and unambiguous auditory stimuli were paired with high and low rewards.Results Both groups showed over 93% accuracy on unambiguous tones indicating intact discrimination, but symptomatic individuals demonstrated increased negative affective bias on ambiguous tones [proportion high reward = 0.42 (s.d. = 0.14)] relative to asymptomatic individuals [0.53 (s.d. = 0.17)] as well as a significantly reduced DDM drift rate. No significant effects were observed for the within-subjects anxiety-induction.Conclusions Humans with pathological anxiety symptoms directly mimic rodents undergoing anxiogenic manipulation. The lack of sensitivity to transient anxiety suggests the paradigm might be more sensitive to clinically relevant symptoms. Our results establish a direct translational pipeline (and candidate therapeutics screen) from negative affective bias in rodents to pathological mood and anxiety symptoms in humans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective bias", "anxiety", "back-translation", "computational psychiatry", "depression", "drift diffusion model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Animals", "Anxiety Disorders", "Bias", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mood Disorders", "Reaction Time", "Reward", "Rodentia", "Translational Medical Research", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060649629", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56950327100": {"Name": "Aylward J.", "AuthorID": "56950327100", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "24468783200": {"Name": "Robinson O.J.", "AuthorID": "24468783200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56379726100": {"Name": "Hales C.", "AuthorID": "56379726100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Bristol"}, "7402134709": {"Name": "Robinson E.", "AuthorID": "7402134709", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Bristol"}}}
