The transition matrix of the random walk depends on the network weights, while in turn the weight of an edge is reinforced by the passage of a walker. The presence of the network naturally accounts for the mechanism of the \"adjacent possible,\" and the model reproduces both the rate at which novelties emerge and the correlations among them observed empirically. We show this by using synthetic networks and by studying real data sets on the growth of knowledge in different scientific disciplines. Edge-reinforced random walks on complex topologies offer a new modeling framework for the dynamics of correlated novelties and are another example of coevolution of processes and networks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive process", "Complex topology", "Innovation process", "Network dynamics", "Network weights", "Scientific discipline", "Synthetic networks", "Transition matrices", "Creativity", "Diffusion of Innovation", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041012370", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"24474549700": {"Name": "Iacopini I.", "AuthorID": "24474549700", "AffiliationID": "60111768, 60100056", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute, British Library"}, "7003540219": {"Name": "Latora V.", "AuthorID": "7003540219", "AffiliationID": "60010146, 60114717", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica Ed Astronomia, Universit\u00e0 di Catania, INFN"}, "16029209200": {"Name": "Milojevi\u0107 S.", "AuthorID": "16029209200", "AffiliationID": "60010875, 60021121", "AffiliationName": "Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University"}}}
