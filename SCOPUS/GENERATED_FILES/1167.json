Methods: IgG was obtained from 4 patients with LEMS (3 males, 1 female), including 2 patients with lung malignancy. Antibodies against P/Q-type VGCCs were detected in all 4 patients, and against N-type VGCCs in 2. We incubated neuronal cultures with LEMS IgG and determined the size of the total recycling pool of synaptic vesicles and the rate of action potential-evoked exocytosis using fluorescence imaging of the amphiphilic dye SynaptoRed C1. Pooled IgG from healthy volunteers was used as a control. We repeated the experiments on synapses lacking P/Q-type calcium channels from a Cacna1a knockout mouse to determine whether these channels account for the pathogenic effect of LEMS IgG. Results: LEMS IgG had no effect on the total recycling pool size but significantly reduced the rate of action potential-evoked synaptic exocytosis in wild-type neurons when compared with neurons treated with control IgG. In contrast, LEMS IgG had no effect on the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons lacking P/Q-type channels. Conclusions: These data provide direct evidence that LEMS IgG inhibits neurotransmitter release by acting on P/Q-type VGCCs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Autoantibodies", "Calcium Channel Blockers", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Exocytosis", "Female", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Middle Aged", "Neurons", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923560785", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7006388232": {"Name": "Spillane J.", "AuthorID": "7006388232", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55399032700": {"Name": "Ermolyuk Y.", "AuthorID": "55399032700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "15767203000": {"Name": "Cano-Jaimez M.", "AuthorID": "15767203000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603211980": {"Name": "Volynski K.E.", "AuthorID": "6603211980", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203023359": {"Name": "Lang B.", "AuthorID": "57203023359", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "55853794100": {"Name": "Vincent A.", "AuthorID": "55853794100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}}}
