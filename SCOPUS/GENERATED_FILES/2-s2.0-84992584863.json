Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjectives: The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether soft tissue biotype at implant placement has an influence on crestal bone loss (CBL) at 1 year after implant loading. Material and methods: Following electronic search in three databases (MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE and The Cochrane Database) and hand search up to April 2015, two reviewers screened independently and in duplicate the references to identify randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and prospective case series eligible for systematic review and meta-analysis. Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used for assessing risk of bias. Results: From 2944 citations, six studies (6 CCTs) met the inclusion criteria. Four of six individual studies that compared thin vs. thick biotype showed significantly higher CBL in thin biotype. Meta-analysis could only be performed with two studies and the differences did not reach significant level. None of the included studies was of low risk of bias. Conclusions: At present, there is insufficient evidence to answer the question on the differences in clinical outcome in terms of CBL between implants placed in sites with initial soft tissue thickness <2 mm and those with \u22652 mm. Further, well-designed controlled clinical studies are needed to analyze the effect of soft tissue thickness on the clinical outcomes of dental implants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alveolar bone loss", "biotype", "dental implant", "soft tissue thickness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alveolar Bone Loss", "Dental Implants", "Humans", "Periapical Tissue", "Postoperative Complications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992584863", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"55330279000": {"Name": "Akcal\u0131 A.", "AuthorID": "55330279000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oral Research Centre, Institute of Dentistry, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "26639932000": {"Name": "Trullenque-Eriksson A.", "AuthorID": "26639932000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oral Research Centre, Institute of Dentistry, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oral Research Centre, Institute of Dentistry, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oral Research Centre, Institute of Dentistry, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "57191727502": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "57191727502", "AffiliationID": "101685407", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Suzhou Health College"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
