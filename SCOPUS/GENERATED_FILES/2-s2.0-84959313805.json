Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: Thirty-eight eyes from 39 patients with active OT. Methods: Eyes with active OT which underwent SD-OCT were reviewed. SRFs in the posterior pole were further analyzed. Main Outcome Measures: Presence of SRF; its accompanying features, e.g. retinal necrosis, cystoid macular edema (CME), choroidal neovascularization (CNV); and longitudinal changes of SRF, including maximum height and total volume before and after treatment. Results: SRF presented in 45.5% (or 15/33) of eyes with typical active OT and in 51.3% (or 20/39) of eyes with active OT. The mean maximum height and total volume of SRF were 161.0 (range: 23-478) um and 0.47 (range: 0.005-4.12) mm3, respectively. For 12 eyes with SRF related to active retinal necrosis, SRF was observed with complete absorption after conventional anti-toxoplasmosis treatment. The mean duration for observation of SRF clearance was 33.8 (range: 7-84) days. The mean rate of SRF clearance was 0.0128 (range: 0.0002-0.0665) mm3/day. Conclusions: SRF (i.e., serous retinal detachment) is a common feature in patients with active OT when SD-OCT is performed. The majority of SRF was associated with retinal necrosis and reacted well to conventional therapy, regardless of total fluid volume. However, SRF accompanying with CME or CNV responded less favorably or remained refractory to conventional or combined intravitreal treatment, even when the SRF was small in size.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Choroidal Neovascularization", "Humans", "Macular Edema", "Retinal Necrosis Syndrome, Acute", "Retrospective Studies", "Subretinal Fluid", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Toxoplasmosis, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959313805", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35604503800": {"Name": "Ouyang Y.", "AuthorID": "35604503800", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9, University Medicine Berlin, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "55964709900": {"Name": "Shao Q.", "AuthorID": "55964709900", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9, University Medicine Berlin, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "14022810300": {"Name": "Heussen F.M.", "AuthorID": "14022810300", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9, University Medicine Berlin, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "7004548000": {"Name": "St\u00fcbiger N.", "AuthorID": "7004548000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9, University Medicine Berlin, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "7007034187": {"Name": "Pleyer U.", "AuthorID": "7007034187", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9, University Medicine Berlin, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "57214075528": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "57214075528", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "Eye Center, 2nd Hospital, Jilin University"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701477860": {"Name": "Sadda S.R.", "AuthorID": "6701477860", "AffiliationID": "60014349", "AffiliationName": "Doheny Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology"}}}
