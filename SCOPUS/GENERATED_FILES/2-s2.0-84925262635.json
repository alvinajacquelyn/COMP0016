In Brazil, pharmacogenomic results have led to very different interpretations when compared with those obtained in the United States. This is explained as deriving from the genomic heterogeneity of the Brazilian population. This article argues that in the evolving field of pharmacogenomics research in Brazil there is simultaneously both an incorporation and rejection of the US informed race-genes paradigm. We suggest that this must be understood in relation to continuities with national and transnational history of genetic research in Brazil, a differently situated politics of Brazilian public health and the ongoing valorization of miscegenation or race mixture by Brazilian geneticists as a resource for transnational genetic research. Our data derive from anthropological investigation conducted in INCA (Brazilian National Cancer Institute), in Rio de Janeiro, with a focus on the drug warfarin. The criticism of Brazilian scientists regarding the uses of racial categorization includes a revision of mathematical algorithms for drug dosage widely used in clinical procedures around the world. Our analysis reveals how the incorporation of ideas of racial purity and admixture, as it relates to the efficacy of drugs, touches on issues related to the possibility of application of pharmaceutical technologies on a global scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropology of science", "Brazil", "Color/race", "Health policy", "Pharmacogenomics", "Race mixture"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925262635", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"56426327000": {"Name": "Ventura Santos R.", "AuthorID": "56426327000", "AffiliationID": "60000036, 60026004", "AffiliationName": "Escola Nacional de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica, FIOCRUZ, UFRJ"}, "56562504900": {"Name": "Da Silva G.O.", "AuthorID": "56562504900", "AffiliationID": "60001865", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Federal Fluminense"}, "14031617000": {"Name": "Gibbon S.", "AuthorID": "14031617000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
