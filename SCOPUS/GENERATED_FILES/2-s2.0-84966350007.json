All rights reserved.Purpose The study aimed to assess whether engagement in a memory training programme and performing internet brain training exercises improve memory function in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods Seventy-seven people with TLE, complaining of memory difficulties, completed the study. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 67 years and 40 had left TLE. Participants were randomised to one of four conditions; Group 1: traditional memory training, Group 2: Lumosity, an on-line cognitive training programme, Group 3: traditional memory training and Lumosity, and Group 4: no training. Memory efficiency and mood were assessed at baseline and three months later. Results Group analyses indicated improved verbal recall after training (p < 0.001) and improved subjective ratings (p < 0.007). More participants reported a lessening of the memory burden (p < 0.007) after training; differences were significant between Groups 1 and 3 compared to Group 4. Lumosity use was not associated with changes in the memory outcome measures but there was a relationship with depression ratings and the number of memory games played (p < 0.01). Conventional memory training, IQ, and post-surgical status were associated with positive memory outcomes. Conclusions The study indicates traditional memory rehabilitation techniques can help reduce the burden of memory impairment in TLE. There was no evidence that Lumosity the on-line cognitive training programme had specific advantages. Positive change was not universal and larger studies will be required to explore factors associated with successful outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy", "Memory", "Memory rehabilitation", "On-line cognitive training", "Temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Learning", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neurological Rehabilitation", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966350007", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57203018933": {"Name": "Thompson P.", "AuthorID": "57203018933", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}, "57189217570": {"Name": "Conn H.", "AuthorID": "57189217570", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "7004038207": {"Name": "Baxendale S.", "AuthorID": "7004038207", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}, "55981395100": {"Name": "Geraldi C.", "AuthorID": "55981395100", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Behavioural Sciences, Epilepsy Surgical Center (CIREP), Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}, "57188671640": {"Name": "Donnachie E.", "AuthorID": "57188671640", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}, "56019587300": {"Name": "McGrath K.", "AuthorID": "56019587300", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}}}
