Drawing on constructivist analyses of institutional change, we rely on semi-structured interviews with international officials and a review of legal documents to argue that the process of institutional change was driven largely by a contest between conflicting legal norms, rather than a contest between politically organised interest-based groups. International legal experts mobilised various competing normative paradigms residing in the background of policy debates to persuade domestic political actors that privatisation was in their interest, and to legitimise or disqualify the proposed neoliberal privatisation programme. However, the lack of consensus on the background paradigm ushered in a protracted period of ideational contestation. Privatisation in post-war Kosovo was essentially about the 'politics of law', as the legalisation of privatisation policy led inevitably to the contentious politicisation of legal norms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ideational contestation", "international administration", "Kosovo", "law and development", "property rights", "uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029837422", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57195805570": {"Name": "Grasten M.", "AuthorID": "57195805570", "AffiliationID": "60020188", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Business School, Department of Business and Politics"}, "55967798300": {"Name": "Uberti L.", "AuthorID": "55967798300", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Otago"}}}
