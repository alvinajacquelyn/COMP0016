Type 2 innate lymphoid cells from polyps produce IL-5 and IL-13 in response to IL-25 and IL-33, although the relevance of this axis to local mucosal T-cell responses is unknown. Objective We sought to investigate the role of the IL-25/IL-33 axis in local mucosal T-cell responses in patients with CRSwNP. Methods Polyp tissue and blood were obtained from patients undergoing nasal polypectomy. Control nasal biopsy specimens and blood were obtained from healthy volunteers. Tissue was cultured in a short-term explant model. T-cell surface phenotype/intracellular cytokines were assessed by means of flow cytometry. T-cell receptor variable \u03b2-chain analysis was performed with the immunoSEQ assay. Microarrays were performed for gene expression analysis. Results IL-25 receptor (IL-17RB)-expressing TH2 effector cells were identified in nasal polyp tissue but not the healthy nasal mucosa or periphery. IL-17RB+CD4+ polyp-derived TH2 cells coexpressed ST2 (IL-33 receptor) and responded to IL-25 and IL-33 with enhanced IL-5 and IL-13 production. Within IL-17RB+CD4+ T cells, several identical T-cell receptor variable \u03b2-chain complementarity-determining region 3 sequences were identified in different subjects, suggesting clonal expansion driven by a common antigen. Abundant IL-17-producing T cells were observed in both healthy nasal mucosal and polyp populations, with TH17-related genes the most overexpressed compared with peripheral blood T cells. Conclusion IL-25 and IL-33 can interact locally with IL-17RB+ST2+ polyp T cells to augment TH2 responses in patients with CRSwNP. A local TH17 response might be important in healthy nasal mucosal immune homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps", "IL-17RB", "IL-25", "IL-33", "microarray", "nasal mucosa", "ST2", "T-cell phenotype", "T-cell receptor V\u03b2 repertoire", "TH17 cells", "TH2 cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Disease", "Eosinophilia", "Humans", "Interleukin-17", "Interleukin-33", "Nasal Mucosa", "Nasal Polyps", "Rhinitis", "Sinusitis", "Th17 Cells", "Th2 Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960886647", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57169725900": {"Name": "Lam E.P.S.", "AuthorID": "57169725900", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "56097013500": {"Name": "Lennartz-Walker M.", "AuthorID": "56097013500", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "7201752209": {"Name": "Ying S.", "AuthorID": "7201752209", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, Guy's Hospital, King's College London"}, "7006153056": {"Name": "Till S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006153056", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "8208833900": {"Name": "Kariyawasam H.H.", "AuthorID": "8208833900", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "8510694400": {"Name": "Rimmer J.", "AuthorID": "8510694400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Allergy and Medical Rhinology Section, Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital, University College London"}, "57214935023": {"Name": "Lund V.J.", "AuthorID": "57214935023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Allergy and Medical Rhinology Section, Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital, University College London"}, "56732635100": {"Name": "Rana B.M.J.", "AuthorID": "56732635100", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "7101774635": {"Name": "McKenzie A.N.J.", "AuthorID": "7101774635", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "35351287700": {"Name": "Durham S.R.", "AuthorID": "35351287700", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "31767544400": {"Name": "Orban N.", "AuthorID": "31767544400", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "16064267600": {"Name": "Powell N.", "AuthorID": "16064267600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Division of Transplantation Immunology and Mucosal Biology, Medical Research Council Centre for Transplantation, King's College London"}, "7006039639": {"Name": "Cousins D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006039639", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "55543341300": {"Name": "Hopkins C.", "AuthorID": "55543341300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of ENT, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital"}}}
