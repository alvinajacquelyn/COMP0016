Neurophysiol.", "Volume": "127", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 675, "PageEnd": 683, "CitedBy": 37, "DOI": "10.1016/j.clinph.2015.05.017", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84930792207&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.Objective: To compare the strength-duration (S-D) time constants of motor cortex structures activated by current pulses oriented posterior-anterior (PA) or anterior-posterior (AP) across the central sulcus. Methods: Motor threshold and input-output curve, along with motor evoked potential (MEP) latencies, of first dorsal interosseus were determined at pulse widths of 30, 60, and 120 \u03bcs using a controllable pulse parameter (cTMS) device, with the coil oriented PA or AP. These were used to estimate the S-D time constant and we compared with data for responses evoked by cTMS of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Results: The S-D time constant with PA was shorter than for AP stimulation (230.9 \u00b1 97.2 vs. 294.2 \u00b1 90.9 \u03bcs; p < 0.001). These values were similar to those calculated after stimulation of ulnar nerve (197 \u00b1 47 \u03bcs). MEP latencies to AP, but not PA stimulation were affected by pulse width, showing longer latencies following short duration stimuli. Conclusion: PA and AP stimuli appear to activate the axons of neurons with different time constants. Short duration AP pulses are more selective than longer pulses in recruiting longer latency corticospinal output. Significance: More selective stimulation of neural elements may be achieved by manipulating pulse width and orientation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Current direction", "Input-output curve", "Motor threshold", "Pulse width", "Strength-duration time constant", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Waves", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Muscle Strength", "Time Factors", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930792207", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"36930049800": {"Name": "D'Ostilio K.", "AuthorID": "36930049800", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "MoVeRe Group, Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Liege"}, "45661310800": {"Name": "Hannah R.", "AuthorID": "45661310800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35975573700": {"Name": "Ciocca M.", "AuthorID": "35975573700", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Science, University of Milan"}, "26421010200": {"Name": "Chieffo R.", "AuthorID": "26421010200", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Scientific Institute Hospital San Raffaele"}, "56677119600": {"Name": "Chen J.C.A.", "AuthorID": "56677119600", "AffiliationID": "60006988", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, China Medical University"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "26324844800": {"Name": "Goetz S.M.", "AuthorID": "26324844800", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Technical University Munich"}, "6603437086": {"Name": "Peterchev A.V.", "AuthorID": "6603437086", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}}}
