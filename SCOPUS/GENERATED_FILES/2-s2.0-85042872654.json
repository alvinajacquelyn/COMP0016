A sliding mode observder-based approach is presented to estimate system faults using bounds on the uncertainty, and as a special case, a fault reconstruction scheme is available where the reconstructed signal can approximate the fault signal to any accuracy. Sensor FDI for nonlinear systems is considered where a nonlinear diffeomorphism is introduced to exploit the system structure and a simple filter is presented to \u2018transform\u2019 the sensor fault into a pseudo-actuator fault scenario. Both fault estimation and reconstruction are considered. Case studies on a robotic arm and a mass\u2013spring system are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actuator fault", "Diffeomorphisms", "Fault detection and isolation", "Fault estimation", "Fault reconstruction", "LMI techniques", "Sliding mode observers", "System structures"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042872654", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56642060300": {"Name": "Edwards C.", "AuthorID": "56642060300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
