Nintedanib, an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors has recently been shown, in two pivotal phase III studies, to effectively slow IPF disease progression. Consequently nintedanib was given accelerated approval by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF? This monograph explores the preclinical rationale for the antifibrotic role of nintedanib and provides an overview of the available data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute exacerbations", "Clinical trials", "Therapeutics", "Usual interstitial pneumonia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Indoles", "Molecular Structure", "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Treatment Outcome", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937555256", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56366462000": {"Name": "Woodcock H.", "AuthorID": "56366462000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Injury and Tissue Repair, University College London, Imperial College"}, "56799189700": {"Name": "Maher T.", "AuthorID": "56799189700", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Leukocyte Biology, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"}}}
