Purpose There were two errors in our original submission: (i) an error in the equation used to calculate egested nitrogen, ultimately leading to a small (1.8%) reduction in our estimate of nitrogen egestion; and (ii) an omitted step in converting wet weight of ingested material to dry mass, leading to a further approximately 50% reduction in the estimate of nitrogen egestion at the individual and population level. In the nitrogen egestion equation, N was used to define two different variables, and the second N was incorrectly defined and assessed as the percentage concentration of nitrogen found in the grey reef shark tissue, for which we used 14.84% (unpublished data from McCauley et al. [5]). We have rewritten the equation (below) and updated the relevant term to correctly represent the per cent of nitrogen found in the prey species, for which we used 13.0% for the Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus) [4]. The rate of nitrogen egested by an individual i grey reef shark per day (EN) was defined as EN,i = Ii (1 b) Nprey, \u00f01\u00de where I, the mass ingested by the grey reef shark (kg d21), is 2% of the total body weight of the individual shark [7], b, the assimilation efficiency, is 76% [8], Nprey, the mean percentage concentration of nitrogen in the tissue of prey species, is 13.0% nitrogen [4]. The upper bound of total nitrogen egested (kg) by an individual shark onto the nearshore habitat was then calculated as the product of EN and the number of days the shark was detected on the acoustic array (located on the forereef) over the course of the 4 year study (mean = 345.8 + 60.7 days). To estimate the upper bound of nitrogen egested by the entire grey reef shark population at Palmyra per day, we took the average length of a male (138.7 cm) and female (146 cm) grey reef shark from Bradley et al. [2], and the total population and sex ratio estimates from Bradley et al. [3]. In the original submission, I was incorrectly reported in wet weight. We now use the wet to dry weight conversion reported for tropical teleosts (not available for Carcharhinids) in Allgeier et al. [1] where y = 0:279x \u00fe 0:0789, \u00f02\u00de to convert kg wet weight x to kg dry weight y. Therefore, for a 20 kg shark, EN is calculated as the total consumption by the shark per day (2% of 20 kg d21 = 0.4 kg d21), converted to dry weight according to equation (2) (0.279 0.4 kg d21 \u00fe 0.0789 = 0.19 kg d21), multiplied by 1\u20130.76 where 76% is the assimilation efficiency ((1\u20130.76) 0.19 kg d21 = 0.046 kg d21), multiplied by the 13% mean percentage concentration of nitrogen in the prey tissue (0.13 nitrogen 0.046 kg d21), such that total nitrogen egested for that individual is equal to 0.006 kg nitrogen d21. If that same shark was detected on the acoustic array a total of 100 days during the course of the 4 year study, then the upper bound of total nitrogen egested on to the forereef during the study was calculated as 0.006 kg nitrogen d21 100 days = 0.6 kg nitrogen. (Figure presented). (Table presented). 2. Results Corrected estimates are as follows. On average, tagged female sharks egested as much as 6.65 + 0.32 g nitrogen d21, and tagged male sharks egested as much as 5.58 + 0.26 g nitrogen d21. Accounting for detections on the forereef during the 4 year duration of the study, tagged female (n = 27) and male (n = 13) grey reef sharks are estimated to have egested as much as 62.45 and 23.43 kg nitrogen, respectively, across the atoll and near-shore ecosystem. The maximum potential biomass subsidy from pelagic resources was 73.9 kg nitrogen transported onto Palmyra Atoll reefs by the tagged individuals over the study duration. An average female and male individual from the population was estimated to egest as much as 6.47 and 5.64 g d21 of pelagic nitrogen in Palmyra Atoll, respectively. Extrapolating to the total population, we then estimate an upper bound of total biomass transfer of 50.94 kg nitrogen d21, of which as much as 43.81 kg nitrogen d21 is a subsidy from pelagic resources brought to the reef by grey reef sharks. 3. Discussion Correcting our reported nitrogen egestion estimates by 54% for the entire grey reef shark population at Palmyra (52% for female sharks in the study; 56% for male sharks in the study) does not change the proportions of nitrogen distributed across the movement network, nor does it change our conclusion: reef sharks transfer a significant amount of nitrogen to and within an isolated atoll. The total Palmyra shark population heterogeneously egests as much as 50.9 kg d21 (not 94.5 kg d21 as was originally reported) of nitrogen around the reefs, approximately 86%, or 43.8 kg nitrogen d21 (not 81.3 kg nitrogen d21 as was originally reported), of which is likely derived from pelagic resources. We note that our nitrogen flux estimate is for egestion only and does not account for excretion; as a result, we are underestimating total nitrogen flux by the grey reef shark.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062725442", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57201325738": {"Name": "Williams J.", "AuthorID": "57201325738", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6507964322": {"Name": "Papastamatiou Y.", "AuthorID": "6507964322", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602239134": {"Name": "Caselle J.", "AuthorID": "6602239134", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56501248700": {"Name": "Bradley D.", "AuthorID": "56501248700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36162010000": {"Name": "Jacoby D.", "AuthorID": "36162010000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
