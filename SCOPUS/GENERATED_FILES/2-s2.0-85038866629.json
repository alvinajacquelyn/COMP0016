However, the influence of processes acting on infections during transient phases of host movement is poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework that explicitly considers infection dynamics during transient phases of host movement to better predict infection spread through spatial host networks. Accounting for host transient movement captures key processes that occur while hosts move between locations, which together determine the rate at which hosts spread infections through networks. We review theoretical and empirical studies of host movement and infection spread, highlighting the multiple factors that impact the infection status of hosts. We then outline characteristics of hosts, parasites and the environment that influence these dynamics. Recent technological advances provide disease ecologists unprecedented ability to track the fine-scale movement of organisms. These, in conjunction with experimental testing of the factors driving infection dynamics during host movement, can inform models of infection spread based on constituent biological processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "Host-parasite interactions", "Metapopulations", "Movement", "Networks", "Spatial modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Diseases", "Animal Distribution", "Animals", "Animals, Wild", "Host-Parasite Interactions", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038866629", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"48161097400": {"Name": "Daversa D.", "AuthorID": "48161097400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "15834707200": {"Name": "Fenton A.", "AuthorID": "15834707200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Integrative Biology, Biosciences Building, University of Liverpool"}, "43660939900": {"Name": "Dell A.", "AuthorID": "43660939900", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St Louis"}, "7005973727": {"Name": "Garner T.", "AuthorID": "7005973727", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6603416293": {"Name": "Manica A.", "AuthorID": "6603416293", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}}}
