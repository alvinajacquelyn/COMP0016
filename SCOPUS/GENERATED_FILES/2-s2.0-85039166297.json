We have re-examined a wintertime extratropical cyclone from the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Track EXperiment for which an earlier study had shown the warm-sector convection to be in the form of a series of arc-shaped rainbands. Using a 5 km grid version of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model, we show that this convection was enhanced as a result of the properties of an airstream at the base of the dry intrusion that overran the shallow moist zone (SMZ) of the warm sector. This airstream, which we refer to as the Diabatically Modified Cloud-Top Layer (DMCTL), is shown to have originated several hours earlier in part of an ana-cold frontal cloud layer where a region of previously ascending air began systematically to descend. Air from the DMCTL descended from heights of 2\u20133 km to heights of 1\u20132 km over a roughly 5 h period during which sustained evaporation occurred and its potential temperature dropped by up to 5 \u00b0C. This substantially enhanced the convective instability where this airstream overran the SMZ, leading to vigorous boundary-layer convection. The same region of evaporative cooling is also shown to have generated positive potential vorticity (PV) in the upper parts of the DMCTL, with values reaching about 3 PV units where it overran the SMZ. This layer of high PV, although we have not quantified its impact, may have increased the convective instability further by inducing differential advection below it. The cyclone in the present study later underwent frontal fracture and developed a cloud head but the processes diagnosed in this study were underway before the transition occurred.", "AuthorKeywords": ["damaging winds", "evaporative cooling", "extratropical cyclone", "FASTEX", "sting jet", "WRF model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Damaging wind", "Evaporative cooling", "Extratropical cyclones", "FASTEX", "WRF Model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039166297", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"7103293742": {"Name": "Browning K.", "AuthorID": "7103293742", "AffiliationID": "113064740", "AffiliationName": "Independent researcher"}, "25631407400": {"Name": "Smart D.", "AuthorID": "25631407400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, UCL Hazard Centre, University College London"}}}
