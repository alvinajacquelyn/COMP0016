Drawing on a case study of a management consultancy project to redesign public health care, we explain how unarticulated temporal interests and orientations shape the construction of problems, which, in turn, legitimate tasks and time frames. We also show how task and time frames are temporarily fixed and imposed through boundary objects, and the way these may then be reinterpreted and co-opted to deflect pressure to change. Thus, we argue, unarticulated, covert and political temporal inter-dynamics produce expedient provisional temporal settlements, which resolve conflict in the short term, while perpetuating it in the longer run.", "AuthorKeywords": ["boundary objects", "consulting", "health care", "project-based and temporary organization", "projects", "temporal politics", "temporal work", "time"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041914807", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57203784596": {"Name": "McGivern G.", "AuthorID": "57203784596", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}, "6701841335": {"Name": "Dopson S.", "AuthorID": "6701841335", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "7102032963": {"Name": "Fitzgerald L.", "AuthorID": "7102032963", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "7003588058": {"Name": "Ferlie E.", "AuthorID": "7003588058", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "37009805600": {"Name": "Ledger J.", "AuthorID": "37009805600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "7401714616": {"Name": "Bennett C.", "AuthorID": "7401714616", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "55802371098": {"Name": "Fischer M.", "AuthorID": "55802371098", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Australian Catholic University"}}}
