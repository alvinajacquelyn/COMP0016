KGaA, Weinheim.This study describes the characteristics of a lithium-ion battery employing an ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolyte, a Li2O-ZrO2-coated Li[Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2] cathode, and a nanostructured tin-carbon (Sn-C) composite anode. The structure and morphology of the cathode and anode materials were studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The properties of the IL-based electrolyte were studied in terms of conductivity, lithium-ion transport, electrochemical and thermal stability by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, voltammetry, and thermogravimetry. The battery, based on a lithium intercalation/de-intercalation process at the cathode and a lithium alloying/de-alloying process at the anode, showed a stable capacity of 100mAhg-1evolving at approximately 3.3V. The cell configuration proposed here is expected to have high safety due to the nonflammability of the IL-based electrolyte.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon", "Ionic liquids", "Lithium-ion batteries", "Nanostructures", "Zirconium oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cathode and anode", "Cell configurations", "Composite anodes", "Ionic liquid electrolytes", "Lithium intercalation/de-intercalation", "Lithium-ion transport", "Nanostructured anodes", "Structure and morphology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951575070", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56263000800": {"Name": "Agostini M.", "AuthorID": "56263000800", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "56527069000": {"Name": "Ulissi U.", "AuthorID": "56527069000", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "56416532600": {"Name": "Di Lecce D.", "AuthorID": "56416532600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "7102421480": {"Name": "Hassoun J.", "AuthorID": "7102421480", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "57018356800": {"Name": "Ahiara Y.", "AuthorID": "57018356800", "AffiliationID": "116149158", "AffiliationName": "Samsung R and D Institute Japan"}, "57161668900": {"Name": "Ito S.", "AuthorID": "57161668900", "AffiliationID": "116149158", "AffiliationName": "Samsung R and D Institute Japan"}}}
