Drosophila Atrophin (Atro) mutants display many phenotypes, including neurodegeneration, segmentation, patterning and planar polarity defects. Despite Atro\u2019s critical role in development and disease, relatively little is known about Atro\u2019s binding partners and downstream targets. We present the first genomic analysis of Atro using ChIP-seq against endogenous Atro. ChIP-seq identified 1300 potential direct targets of Atro including engrailed, and components of the Dpp and Notch signaling pathways. We show that Atro regulates Dpp and Notch signaling in larval imaginal discs, at least partially via regulation of thickveins and fringe. In addition, bioinformatics analyses, sequential ChIP and coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that Atro interacts with the Drosophila GAGA Factor, Trithorax-like (Trl), and they bind to the same loci simultaneously. Phenotypic analyses of Trl and Atro clones suggest that Atro is required to modulate the transcription activation by Trl in larval imaginal discs. Taken together, these data indicate that Atro is a major Trl cofactor that functions to moderate developmental gene transcription.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018919298", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56375235800": {"Name": "Yeung K.", "AuthorID": "56375235800", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "10143472300": {"Name": "Tsatskis Y.", "AuthorID": "10143472300", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "7003895504": {"Name": "McNeill H.", "AuthorID": "7003895504", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "55317821600": {"Name": "Boija A.", "AuthorID": "55317821600", "AffiliationID": "60025747, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University"}, "36946267100": {"Name": "Holmqvist P.H.", "AuthorID": "36946267100", "AffiliationID": "60025747, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University"}, "6602830760": {"Name": "Mannervik M.", "AuthorID": "6602830760", "AffiliationID": "60025747, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University"}, "55521622500": {"Name": "Karlsson E.", "AuthorID": "55521622500", "AffiliationID": "60003554", "AffiliationName": "Division of CBRN Security and Defence, FOI-Swedish Defence Research Agency"}, "7006512780": {"Name": "Stenberg P.", "AuthorID": "7006512780", "AffiliationID": "60003554", "AffiliationName": "Division of CBRN Security and Defence, FOI-Swedish Defence Research Agency"}, "37026733700": {"Name": "Nisoli I.", "AuthorID": "37026733700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "6602227252": {"Name": "Fanto M.", "AuthorID": "6602227252", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King\u2019s College London"}, "35970451500": {"Name": "Yap D.", "AuthorID": "35970451500", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "15759396300": {"Name": "Aparicio S.", "AuthorID": "15759396300", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "55965528000": {"Name": "Lorzadeh A.", "AuthorID": "55965528000", "AffiliationID": "60028379, 60117049", "AffiliationName": "Canada\u2019s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency"}, "6507356847": {"Name": "Moksa M.", "AuthorID": "6507356847", "AffiliationID": "60028379, 60117049", "AffiliationName": "Canada\u2019s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency"}, "10341470700": {"Name": "Hirst M.", "AuthorID": "10341470700", "AffiliationID": "60028379, 60117049", "AffiliationName": "Canada\u2019s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency"}}}
