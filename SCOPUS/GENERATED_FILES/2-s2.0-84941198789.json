Design: Secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled intervention study. Setting: Metropolitan areas of Portland, Oregon. Sample: 300 foreign-born Chinese immigrant women aged 40 years or older. Of these, 83 women (28%) had never had a mammogram. Methods: Participants who had not been screened with a mammogram within the past 12 months were randomized into either an education group or a control (brochure) group. All participants completed a baseline survey, which was administered again at 3, 6, and 12 months. Main Research Variables: Mammography history, breast cancer knowledge, perceived risks, susceptibility, benefits, and common and cultural barriers. Findings: Women who had never been screened were less likely to have insurance, a regular healthcare provider, or to have been instructed to have a mammogram. Postintervention in the education group, mammogram completion was not significantly different between those with or without a history of screening (p = 0.52). In the control brochure group, significantly more women with a history of screening had a mammogram (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Practitioners must be aware of differential effects of education on mammography cancer screening based on women's history of screening. Implications for Nursing: Print material may not be as effective with women who have never been screened with a mammogram. Targeted approaches based on such understanding has the potential to decrease the breast cancer screening disparity among Chinese immigrant women.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer screening", "Cancer screening education", "Chinese immigrant women", "Mammography screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Breast Neoplasms", "China", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Emigrants and Immigrants", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Mammography", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941198789", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"]], "AuthorData": {"14023048300": {"Name": "Lee-Lin F.", "AuthorID": "14023048300", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "35174968200": {"Name": "Pedhiwala N.", "AuthorID": "35174968200", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "23468967400": {"Name": "Dieckmann N.", "AuthorID": "23468967400", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "55290806000": {"Name": "Nguyen T.", "AuthorID": "55290806000", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "36087734300": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "36087734300", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, Ohio State University"}}}
