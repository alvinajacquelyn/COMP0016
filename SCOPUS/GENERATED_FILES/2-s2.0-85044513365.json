Addiction published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society for the Study of Addiction.Aims: To assess (1) how far the efficacies of front-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies vary as a function of smoker characteristics and (2) associations between these characteristics and success of smoking cessation attempts. Design: Prospective correlational study in the context of a double-blind randomized trial. The outcome was regressed individually onto each covariate after adjusting for treatment, and then a forward stepwise model constructed. Treatment moderator effects of covariates were tested by treatment \u00d7 covariate interactions. Setting: Health service facilities in multiple countries. Participants: Data came from 8120 smokers willing to make a quit attempt, randomized to varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or placebo in Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study (EAGLES) between 30 November 2011 and 13 January 2015. Measurements: Smoker characteristics measured at baseline were country, psychiatric history, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), ethnic group, life-time suicidal ideation/behaviour, anxiety, depression, aggression, psychotropic medication, history of alcohol/substance use disorder, age of starting smoking, cigarette dependence [Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD)] and prior use of study medicines. Outcome was biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence at weeks 9\u201324 from start of treatment. Findings: No statistically significant treatment \u00d7 covariate interactions were found. Odds of success were associated independently positively with age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00, 1.01], BMI (1.01; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.02) and age of starting smoking (1.03; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.04). Odds were associated independently negatively with US (versus non-US) study site (0.53; 95% CI = 0.46, 0.61), black (versus white) ethnic group (0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72), mood disorder (0.85; 95% CI = 0.73, 0.99), anxiety disorder (0.71; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.90) and psychotic disorder (0.73; 95% CI = 0.50, 1.07), taking psychotropic medication (0.81; 95% CI = 0.68, 0.95), FTCD (0.89; 95% CI = 0.87, 0.92) and previous use of NRT (0.78; 95% CI = 0.67, 0.91). Conclusions: While a range of smoker characteristics\u2014including psychiatric history, cigarette dependence and prior use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)\u2014are associated with lower cessation rates, they do not substantially influence the efficacy of varenicline, bupropion or NRT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bupropion", "nicotine replacement therapy", "placebo", "smoking cessation", "treatment effects", "varenicline"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Anxiety Disorders", "Bupropion", "Double-Blind Method", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Prognosis", "Psychotic Disorders", "Psychotropic Drugs", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation", "Smoking Cessation Agents", "Tobacco Use Cessation Devices", "Treatment Outcome", "United States", "Varenicline"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044513365", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602164247": {"Name": "Evins A.E.", "AuthorID": "6602164247", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "57192805636": {"Name": "Maravic M.C.", "AuthorID": "57192805636", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "16549198600": {"Name": "Benowitz N.L.", "AuthorID": "16549198600", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "35485400700": {"Name": "Russ C.", "AuthorID": "35485400700", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "7003891641": {"Name": "McRae T.", "AuthorID": "7003891641", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "16157175300": {"Name": "Lawrence D.", "AuthorID": "16157175300", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "22956290900": {"Name": "St Aubin L.", "AuthorID": "22956290900", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "9037993900": {"Name": "Krishen A.", "AuthorID": "9037993900", "AffiliationID": "60095340, 60097308", "AffiliationName": "PAREXEL International on behalf of GSK, Research Triangle Park"}, "6603919154": {"Name": "Anthenelli R.M.", "AuthorID": "6603919154", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}}}
