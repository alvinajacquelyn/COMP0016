Visualisation and quantification of scar tissues require a segmentation of both the left atrium (LA) and the high intensity scar regions from LGE-CMRI images. These two segmentation tasks are challenging due to the cancelling of healthy tissue signal, low signal-to-noise ratio and often limited image quality in these patients. Most approaches require manual supervision and/or a second bright-blood MRI acquisition for anatomical segmentation. Segmenting both the LA anatomy and the scar tissues automatically from a single LGE-CMRI acquisition is highly in demand. In this study, we proposed a novel fully automated multiview two-task (MVTT) recursive attention model working directly on LGE-CMRI images that combines a sequential learning and a dilated residual learning to segment the LA (including attached pulmonary veins) and delineate the atrial scars simultaneously via an innovative attention model. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed MVTT achieves compelling improvement, enabling to generate a patient-specific anatomical and atrial scar assessment model.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ablation therapy", "Assessment models", "Atrial fibrillation", "Healthy tissues", "Low signal-to-noise ratio", "Patient specific", "Sequential learning", "State-of-the-art methods"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054088089", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57200177920": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "57200177920", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui University"}, "35303881100": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "35303881100", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui University"}, "26321470100": {"Name": "Du X.", "AuthorID": "26321470100", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Anhui University"}, "55584800628": {"Name": "Yang G.", "AuthorID": "55584800628", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7005490421": {"Name": "Mohiaddin R.", "AuthorID": "7005490421", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "56804219800": {"Name": "Wong T.", "AuthorID": "56804219800", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57206370469": {"Name": "Keegan J.", "AuthorID": "57206370469", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7007100394": {"Name": "Firmin D.", "AuthorID": "7007100394", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "55320405200": {"Name": "Gao Z.", "AuthorID": "55320405200", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "14827559100": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "14827559100", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57220845445": {"Name": "Ni H.", "AuthorID": "57220845445", "AffiliationID": "60111768", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute"}, "57196481310": {"Name": "Angelini E.", "AuthorID": "57196481310", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London"}}}
