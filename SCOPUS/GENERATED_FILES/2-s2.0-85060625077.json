The k-space PSTD method improves on this by incorporating an additional factor to remove the numerical dispersion which arises from the discretisation of the time derivatives. However, the effect of the temporal discretisation of time-varying sources has not previously been considered, although it can lead to substantial errors in the predicted field unless the timestep is sufficiently small to ensure the highest frequency is sampled at many points-per-period. Here, a correction factor is derived which eliminates this source of error, resulting in a k-space PSTD method that retains the spatial sampling advantage of conventional PSTD schemes but is also accurate as long as the temporal sampling is greater than two points-per-period and the CFL number is < 1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acoustic simulation", "k-space", "pseudospectral time domain", "sources"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic simulations", "Correction factors", "K space", "Numerical dispersions", "Pseudospectral time domain", "Pseudospectral time domain methods", "Substantial errors", "Temporal sampling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060625077", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
