Ecology Letters published by CNRS and John Wiley & Sons LtdClimatic changes have profound effects on the distribution of biodiversity, but untangling the links between climatic change and ecosystem functioning is challenging, particularly in high diversity systems such as tropical forests. Tropical forests may also show different responses to a changing climate, with baseline climatic conditions potentially inducing differences in the strength and timing of responses to droughts. Trait-based approaches provide an opportunity to link functional composition, ecosystem function and environmental changes. We demonstrate the power of such approaches by presenting a novel analysis of long-term responses of different tropical forest to climatic changes along a rainfall gradient. We explore how key ecosystem's biogeochemical properties have shifted over time as a consequence of multi-decadal drying. Notably, we find that drier tropical forests have increased their deciduous species abundance and generally changed more functionally than forests growing in wetter conditions, suggesting an enhanced ability to adapt ecologically to a drying environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drying climate", "ecosystem functioning", "plant traits", "tropical forests", "West Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biodiversity", "Climate Change", "Droughts", "Forests", "Trees", "Tropical Climate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062351180", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"54792726900": {"Name": "Aguirre-Guti\u00e9rrez J.", "AuthorID": "54792726900", "AffiliationID": "60032678", "AffiliationName": "Biodiversity Dynamics, Naturalis Biodiversity Center"}, "6507799089": {"Name": "Oliveras I.", "AuthorID": "6507799089", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "56441308800": {"Name": "Rifai S.", "AuthorID": "56441308800", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "57198889168": {"Name": "Gvozdevaite A.", "AuthorID": "57198889168", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "55451320400": {"Name": "Moore S.", "AuthorID": "55451320400", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "7004035832": {"Name": "Malhi Y.", "AuthorID": "7004035832", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "37064348400": {"Name": "Fauset S.", "AuthorID": "37064348400", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Science, University of Plymouth"}, "6603089235": {"Name": "Adu-Bredu S.", "AuthorID": "6603089235", "AffiliationID": "60071885, 60071881", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana, University Post Office, KNUST"}, "22136391000": {"Name": "Peprah T.", "AuthorID": "22136391000", "AffiliationID": "60071885, 60071881", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana, University Post Office, KNUST"}, "6504457449": {"Name": "Affum-Baffoe K.", "AuthorID": "6504457449", "AffiliationID": "106748181", "AffiliationName": "Mensuration Unit, Forestry Commission of Ghana"}, "7402604855": {"Name": "Baker T.R.", "AuthorID": "7402604855", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ecology and Global Change, School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "36171558900": {"Name": "Hubau W.", "AuthorID": "36171558900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ecology and Global Change, School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "56105640400": {"Name": "Lewis S.L.", "AuthorID": "56105640400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7101775250": {"Name": "Phillips O.L.", "AuthorID": "7101775250", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ecology and Global Change, School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "55323559100": {"Name": "Feldpausch T.R.", "AuthorID": "55323559100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Geography, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "18434144800": {"Name": "Kraft N.J.B.", "AuthorID": "18434144800", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California"}, "56186457800": {"Name": "Niinemets \u00dc.", "AuthorID": "56186457800", "AffiliationID": "60068854", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences"}, "35590956500": {"Name": "Ziemi\u0144ska K.", "AuthorID": "35590956500", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University"}, "7004590620": {"Name": "Enquist B.", "AuthorID": "7004590620", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "University of Arizona"}}}
