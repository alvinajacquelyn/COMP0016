Here, simple, lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) have been fabricated by integrating the aluminum electrodes onto Er3+/Fe3+ stimulated electroactive, visible-light-emitting, and large dielectric PVDF films in which ErCl3\u00b76H2O and Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O act as the catalytic agents for electroactive \u03b2 polymorph nucleation and the enhancement of dielectric properties. The developed PENGs exhibit excellent energy-harvesting performance with very high power density and very fast charging ability compared with the previously reported PVDF-assisted prototype nanogenerators. The PENGs lead to very large power density (\u223c160 and \u223c55.34 mW cm-3) under periodic finger imparting for Er3+- and Fe3+-stimulated PVDF-film-based energy-harvester units, respectively. The fabricated self-powered PENG is also able to light up 54 commercially available light-emitting diodes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dielectric constant", "electroactive \u03b2-phase", "piezoelectric nanogenerator", "PVDF", "self-powered"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aluminum electrodes", "Electro actives", "High power density", "Output characteristics", "Piezoelectric nanogenerator", "PVDF", "Self-powered", "Technological challenges"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024114327", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56578161300": {"Name": "Hoque N.A.", "AuthorID": "56578161300", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "15045583000": {"Name": "Roy S.", "AuthorID": "15045583000", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "56248104400": {"Name": "Kool A.", "AuthorID": "56248104400", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "16456874100": {"Name": "Bagchi B.", "AuthorID": "16456874100", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "57194904648": {"Name": "Biswas P.", "AuthorID": "57194904648", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "57194897595": {"Name": "Saikh M.M.", "AuthorID": "57194897595", "AffiliationID": "118836930", "AffiliationName": "Government General Degree College"}, "57194899759": {"Name": "Khatun F.", "AuthorID": "57194899759", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "55476996600": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55476996600", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "55424774600": {"Name": "Ray P.P.", "AuthorID": "55424774600", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "57219524421": {"Name": "Thakur P.", "AuthorID": "57219524421", "AffiliationID": "100350557", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Netaji Nagar College for Women"}}}
