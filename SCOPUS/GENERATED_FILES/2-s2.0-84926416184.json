Multiagent Router Throttling is a novel approach to defend against DDoS attacks where multiple reinforcement learning agents are installed on a set of routers and learn to throttle or rate-limit traffic towards a victim server. It has been demonstrated to perform well against DDoS attacks in small-scale network topologies. The focus of this paper is to tackle the scalability challenge. Scalability is one of the most important aspects of a defence system since a non-scalable defence mechanism will never be considered, let alone adopted, for wide deployment by a company or organisation. In this paper we introduce Coordinated Team Learning (CTL) which is a novel design to the original Multiagent Router Throttling approach. One of the novel characteristics of our approach is that it provides a decentralised coordinated response to the DDoS problem. It incorporates several mechanisms, namely, hierarchical team-based communication, task decomposition and team rewards and its scalability is successfully demonstrated in experiments involving up to 100 reinforcement learning agents. We compare our proposed approach against a baseline and a popular state-of-the-art router throttling technique from the network security literature and we show that our approach significantly outperforms both of them in a series of scenarios with increasingly sophisticated attack dynamics. Furthermore, we show that our approach is more resilient and adaptable than the existing throttling approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coordination and cooperation", "DDoS attacks", "Network security", "Reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coordination and cooperation", "DDoS Attack", "Defence mechanisms", "Distributed denial of service attack", "Multi-agent reinforcement learning", "Reinforcement learning agent", "Small-scale networks", "Task decomposition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926416184", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55670857800": {"Name": "Malialis K.", "AuthorID": "55670857800", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of York"}, "6603157921": {"Name": "Kudenko D.", "AuthorID": "6603157921", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of York"}}}
