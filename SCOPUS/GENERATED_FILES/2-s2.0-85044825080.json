However, standard touch interactions, such as dragging to move content, do not scale well to large surfaces and were not designed to support collaboration, such as passing an object around. This paper introduces CoReach, a set of collaborative gestures that combine input from multiple users in order to manipulate content, facilitate data exchange and support communication. We conducted an observational study to inform the design of CoReach, and a controlled study showing that it reduced physical fatigue and facilitated collaboration when compared with traditional multi-touch gestures. A final study assessed the value of also allowing input through a handheld tablet to manipulate content from a distance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-located collaboration", "Shared interaction", "Wall display"], "IndexKeywords": ["Co-located collaboration", "Data manipulations", "Multi-touch gestures", "Observational study", "Physical fatigues", "Shared interaction", "Wall displays", "Wall-sized displays"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044825080", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55247039300": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "55247039300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, ICRI Cities, University College London"}, "55919438800": {"Name": "Chapuis O.", "AuthorID": "55919438800", "AffiliationID": "60106208, 60106017, 60008134, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "LRI, Univ.
