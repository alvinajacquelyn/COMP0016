We quantify the relative contributions of a bluer component, function of X-ray irradiation, and a redder component, constant and likely coming from an old stellar population. We estimate a black hole mass (2+ -2 1) \u00d7 104 \u1e40, a spin parameter a/M 0.9 for moderately face-on view and a peak outburst luminosity 0.3 times the Eddington luminosity. We discuss the discrepancy between the characteristic sizes inferred from the short X-ray time-scale (R \u223c a few 1011 cm) and from the optical emitter (Rvcos 2.2 \u00d7 1013 cm). One possibility is that the optical emitter is a circumbinary disc; however, we disfavour this scenario because it would require a very small donor star. A more plausible scenario is that the disc is large but only the inner annuli are involved in the X-ray outburst. We propose that the recurrent outbursts are caused by an accretion-rate oscillation driven by wind instability in the inner disc. We argue that the system has a long-term-average accretion rate of a few per cent Eddington, just below the upper limit of the low/hard state; a wind-driven oscillation can trigger transitions to the high/soft state, with a recurrence period \u223c1 yr (much longer than the binary period, which we estimate as \u223c10 d). The oscillation that dominated the system in the last decade is now damped such that the accretion rate no longer reaches the level required to trigger a transition. Finally, we highlight similarities between disc winds in HLX-1 and in the Galactic black hole V404 Cyg.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Black hole physics", "X-rays: binaries", "X-rays: individual: HLX-1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045541412", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7006241401": {"Name": "Soria R.", "AuthorID": "7006241401", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57168763700": {"Name": "Urquhart R.", "AuthorID": "57168763700", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60189099", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987"}, "56511979300": {"Name": "Musaeva A.", "AuthorID": "56511979300", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Institute for Astronomy, School of Physics A28, University of Sydney"}, "56247440800": {"Name": "Farrell S.", "AuthorID": "56247440800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Institute for Astronomy, School of Physics A28, University of Sydney"}, "7404512316": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "7404512316", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7003499607": {"Name": "Zampieri L.", "AuthorID": "7003499607", "AffiliationID": "60031125, 60030106", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Astronomical Observatory of Padova"}, "57218775759": {"Name": "Federle S.", "AuthorID": "57218775759", "AffiliationID": "60031125, 60030106", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Astronomical Observatory of Padova"}, "57119820800": {"Name": "Van Der Helm E.", "AuthorID": "57119820800", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}}}
