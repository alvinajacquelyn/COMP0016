While it is widely accepted that predictions across different stimulus attributes (e.g., time and content) facilitate sensory processing, it is unknown whether predictions across these attributes rely on the same neural mechanism. Here, to elucidate the neural mechanisms of predictions, we combine invasive electrophysiological recordings (human electrocorticography in 4 females and 2 males) with computational modeling while manipulating predictions about content (\u201cwhat\u201d) and time (\u201cwhen\u201d). We found that \u201cwhen\u201d predictions increased evoked activity over motor and prefrontal regions both at early (\u223c180 ms) and late (430 \u2013 450 ms) latencies. \u201cWhat\u201d predictability, however, increased evoked activity only over prefrontal areas late in time (420 \u2013 460 ms). Beyond these dissociable influences, we found that \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d predictability interactively modulated the amplitude of early (165 ms) evoked responses in the superior temporal gyrus. We modeled the observed neural responses using biophysically realistic neural mass models, to better understand whether \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d predictions tap into similar or different neurophysiological mechanisms. Our modeling results suggest that \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d predictability rely on complementary neural processes: \u201cwhat\u201d predictions increased short-term plasticity in auditory areas, whereas \u201cwhen\u201d predictability increased synaptic gain in motor areas. Thus, content and temporal predictions engage complementary neural mechanisms in different regions, suggesting domain-specific prediction signaling along the cortical hierarchy. Encoding predictions through different mechanisms may endow the brain with the flexibility to efficiently signal different sources of predictions, weight them by their reliability, and allow for their encoding without mutual interference.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Associative learning", "Biophysical modeling", "Electrocorticography", "Prediction", "Predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Auditory Cortex", "Electrocorticography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Motor Cortex", "Neural Pathways", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reaction Time", "Time Factors", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054433467", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"37761031800": {"Name": "Auksztulewicz R.", "AuthorID": "37761031800", "AffiliationID": "60104956", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Max-Planck-Institute for Empirical Aesthetics"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35476748000": {"Name": "Nobre A.C.", "AuthorID": "35476748000", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "23009707100": {"Name": "Schwiedrzik C.M.", "AuthorID": "23009707100", "AffiliationID": "60008610", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, German Primate Center"}, "6507596369": {"Name": "Thesen T.", "AuthorID": "6507596369", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7103092878": {"Name": "Doyle W.", "AuthorID": "7103092878", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7102688352": {"Name": "Devinsky O.", "AuthorID": "7102688352", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "22938003800": {"Name": "Melloni L.", "AuthorID": "22938003800", "AffiliationID": "60104956", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Max-Planck-Institute for Empirical Aesthetics"}, "57200897544": {"Name": "Schroeder C.E.", "AuthorID": "57200897544", "AffiliationID": "60006463", "AffiliationName": "Nathan Kline Institute"}}}
