During the last three decades, nanoscale Au has attracted remarkable attention and has been shown to be an exceptional catalyst, especially for oxidation reactions. Herein, we elucidate a puzzle in catalysis by using multiscale computational modeling: the experimentally observed \"magic number\" CO oxidation catalytic behavior of sub-nanoscale Au clusters. Our results demonstrate that support effects (cluster charging), symmetry-induced electronic effects on the clusters, catalyst reconstruction, competing chemical pathways and formation of carbonate contribute to the marked differences in the observed catalytic behavior of Aun- clusters with n = 6, 8 and 10 atoms. This is the first demonstration of multiscale simulations on sub-nanoscale catalysts unraveling the magic number activity for the CO oxidation reaction on Au.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst reconstruction", "Catalytic behavior", "Chemical pathways", "Electronic effects", "Multi-scale simulation", "Multiscale computational model", "Nanoscale catalysts", "Oxidation reactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916242370", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"53863887600": {"Name": "Nikbin N.", "AuthorID": "53863887600", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware"}, "7101636618": {"Name": "Vlachos D.", "AuthorID": "7101636618", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware"}, "56330020300": {"Name": "Austin N.", "AuthorID": "56330020300", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh"}, "6507389726": {"Name": "Mpourmpakis G.", "AuthorID": "6507389726", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7004483530": {"Name": "Stamatakis M.", "AuthorID": "7004483530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
