Methods: Eighteen AgP patients who had similar bilateral intrabony defects were treated. In all patients, the defects presented with radiographic evidence of an intrabony defect \u22653 and \u22655 mm of periodontal pocket depths (PPD). The surgical procedures included access for root instrumentation using SPPF alone (control) or, after debridement, a placement of resorbable GTR membrane (test). The standardised radiographic assessments were carried out at pre-surgical baseline and at 6 and 12 month post-surgery. Radiographic linear measurements and subtraction radiography were used as the method of analysis. Results: Both treatments showed significant improvements in linear radiographic bone fill and defect resolution at 6 and 12 months, compared to baseline. The 12-month subtraction radiography at the GTR sites showed a significant improvement compared to the 6-month outcomes. Conclusions: Both therapies were effective in the treatment of intrabony defects in AgP patients although no significant differences between them could be demonstrated. The finding that the bone fill and resolution of the defect at the GTR sites were significantly higher at 12 months than at 6 months after treatment indicates that bone regeneration is still an ongoing process at 6 months post-surgery. Clinical relevance: Radiographic assessment of periodontal regeneration should be carried out at 12 months post-surgery in order to evaluate the complete healing of the bony defect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggressive periodontitis", "Guided tissue regeneration", "Radiographic linear measurement", "Standardised radiography", "Subtraction radiograph"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aggressive Periodontitis", "Alveolar Bone Loss", "Female", "Guided Tissue Regeneration, Periodontal", "Humans", "Male", "Membranes, Artificial", "Single-Blind Method", "Surgical Flaps", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944538118", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"35337670900": {"Name": "Rakmanee T.", "AuthorID": "35337670900", "AffiliationID": "60012521", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Dentistry, Thammasat University"}, "6507939339": {"Name": "Auplish G.", "AuthorID": "6507939339", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6603443853": {"Name": "Darbar U.", "AuthorID": "6603443853", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57210967677": {"Name": "Olsen I.", "AuthorID": "57210967677", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Dentistry Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}, "7202289475": {"Name": "Griffiths G.S.", "AuthorID": "7202289475", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Dentistry, University of Sheffield"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
