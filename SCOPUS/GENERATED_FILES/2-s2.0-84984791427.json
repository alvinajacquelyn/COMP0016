Our core assumption is that operational competency can be objectively expressed by specific motion-based measures. TEE experiments were carried out with an augmented reality simulation platform involving both novice trainees and expert radiologists. Probe motion data were collected and used to formulate various kinematic parameters. Subsequent analysis showed that statistically significant differences exist among the two groups for the majority of the metrics investigated. Experts exhibited lower completion times and higher average velocity and acceleration, attributed to their refined ability for efficient and economical probe manipulation. In addition, their navigation pattern is characterised by increased smoothness and fluidity, evaluated through the measures of dimensionless jerk and spectral arc length. Utilised as inputs to well-known clustering algorithms, the derived metrics are capable of discriminating experience levels with high accuracy (>84 %).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Motion analysis", "Skill assessment", "Transoesophageal echocardiography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Average velocity", "Completion time", "Kinematic parameters", "Navigation patterns", "Simulation platform", "Skill assessment", "Statistically significant difference", "Technical skills"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984791427", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35097627900": {"Name": "Mazomenos E.B.", "AuthorID": "35097627900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "47862298300": {"Name": "Vasconcelos F.", "AuthorID": "47862298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "49964656700": {"Name": "Smelt J.", "AuthorID": "49964656700", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St George\u2019s University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16039205300": {"Name": "Jahangiri M.", "AuthorID": "16039205300", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St George\u2019s University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212430196": {"Name": "Wright S.", "AuthorID": "57212430196", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St George\u2019s University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213405016": {"Name": "Martin B.", "AuthorID": "57213405016", "AffiliationID": "124837660", "AffiliationName": "St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57221244786": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57221244786", "AffiliationID": "124837660", "AffiliationName": "St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190965509": {"Name": "Prescott H.", "AuthorID": "57190965509", "AffiliationID": "117261167", "AffiliationName": "Glassworks Ltd"}}}
