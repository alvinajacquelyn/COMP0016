It uses the theoretical lens of biographical learning (with its key concepts of agency and narrative) to explore what these interviews can tell us about the ways adults express the benefits of liberal adult education and its relationship to informal learning. Initial findings suggest that benefits are experienced as \u2018bundles\u2019 and that adults talk about their participation in adult education as a form of \u2018taking control\u2019 of their lives, including \u2018choosing how to be old\u2019 and glimpsing \u2018fulfillment\u2019. It also suggests that the ways adults talk about these benefits\u2014and their wider biographical learning\u2014can be used to identify a) foci for further national and pan-European analysis of the BeLL data; b) avenues for future research; and c) potentially fruitful theoretical lenses through which we can develop our understanding of the value of this and other interview data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency and wider benefits of learning", "biographical learning", "liberal adult education", "participation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045201060", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35174263900": {"Name": "Duncan S.", "AuthorID": "35174263900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
