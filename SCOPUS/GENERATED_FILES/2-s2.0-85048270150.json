It has been argued that socio-demographic factors (e.g. maternal age and education), co-occurring environmental risk factors, or pleiotropic genetic effects may account for the association between MSDP and later outcomes. This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the association between MSDP and a single harmonized component of externalizing: aggressive behaviour, measured throughout childhood and adolescence.Methods Data came from four prospective twin cohorts - Twins Early Development Study, Netherlands Twin Register, Childhood and Adolescent Twin Study of Sweden, and FinnTwin12 study - who collaborate in the EU-ACTION consortium. Data from 30 708 unrelated individuals were analysed. Based on item level data, a harmonized measure of aggression was created at ages 9-10; 12; 14-15 and 16-18.Results MSDP predicted aggression in childhood and adolescence. A meta-analysis across the four samples found the independent effect of MSDP to be 0.4% (r = 0.066), this remained consistent when analyses were performed separately by sex. All other perinatal factors combined explained 1.1% of the variance in aggression across all ages and samples (r = 0.112). Paternal smoking and aggressive parenting strategies did not account for the MSDP-aggression association, consistent with the hypothesis of a small direct link between MSDP and aggression.Conclusions Perinatal factors, including MSDP, account for a small portion of the variance in aggression in childhood and adolescence. Later experiences may play a greater role in shaping adolescents' aggressive behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "aggression", "cross-cultural", "maternal smoking during pregnancy", "meta-analysis", "parental aggression", "paternal smoking", "perinatal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Aggression", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Smoking", "Twins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048270150", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57188808291": {"Name": "Malanchini M.", "AuthorID": "57188808291", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57185766300": {"Name": "Smith-Woolley E.", "AuthorID": "57185766300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London"}, "56035027500": {"Name": "Ayorech Z.", "AuthorID": "56035027500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London"}, "55953973500": {"Name": "Rimfeld K.", "AuthorID": "55953973500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London"}, "55954135900": {"Name": "Krapohl E.", "AuthorID": "55954135900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London"}, "36050187200": {"Name": "Plomin R.", "AuthorID": "36050187200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London"}, "13410204400": {"Name": "Vuoksimaa E.", "AuthorID": "13410204400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecular Medicine FIMM, University of Helsinki"}, "7103360008": {"Name": "Korhonen T.", "AuthorID": "7103360008", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecular Medicine FIMM, University of Helsinki"}, "35379599600": {"Name": "Kaprio J.", "AuthorID": "35379599600", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "7102291011": {"Name": "Bartels M.", "AuthorID": "7102291011", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Psychology, Netherlands Twin Register, Vrije Universiteit"}, "6506997341": {"Name": "Van Beijsterveldt T.C.E.M.", "AuthorID": "6506997341", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Psychology, Netherlands Twin Register, Vrije Universiteit"}, "35378012400": {"Name": "Boomsma D.I.", "AuthorID": "35378012400", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Psychology, Netherlands Twin Register, Vrije Universiteit"}, "7402136810": {"Name": "Rose R.J.", "AuthorID": "7402136810", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University"}, "26632309500": {"Name": "Lundstr\u00f6m S.", "AuthorID": "26632309500", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ethics, Law and Mental Health and the Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, Gothenburg University"}, "54882141900": {"Name": "Anckars\u00e4ter H.", "AuthorID": "54882141900", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ethics, Law and Mental Health and the Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, Gothenburg University"}, "7005398112": {"Name": "Lichtenstein P.", "AuthorID": "7005398112", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
