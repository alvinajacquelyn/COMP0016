Here, we present a theoretical study of the structural features of the pure-silica and aluminium-substituted MFI nanosheets. We have analysed the effects of aluminium substitution on the vibrational properties of silanols as well as the features of protons as counter-ions. The formation of the two-dimensional system did not lead to appreciable distortions within the framework. Moreover, the effects on the structure due to the aluminium dopants were the same in both the bulk and the slab. The principal differences were related to the silanol groups that form hydrogen-bonds with neighbouring aluminium-substituted silanols, whereas intra-framework hydrogen-bonds increase the stability of aluminium-substituted silanols toward dehydration. Thus, we have complemented previous experimental and theoretical studies, showing the lamellar MFI zeolite to be a very stable material of high crystallinity regardless of its very thin structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DFT", "MFI nanosheet", "Pentasil layer", "Silanol group", "Zeolite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Density functional theory studies", "High crystallinity", "Pentasil layer", "Silanol groups", "Structural feature", "Theoretical study", "Two-dimensional systems", "Vibrational properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958961713", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56313919100": {"Name": "Hernandez-Tamargo C.", "AuthorID": "56313919100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "23569649000": {"Name": "Roldan A.", "AuthorID": "23569649000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "De Leeuw N.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}}}
