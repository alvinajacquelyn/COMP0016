Conventional histology provides good spatial resolution with which to evaluate the microvascular structure but affords no 3-dimensional information; this limitation could lead to misinterpretations of the complex microvessel network in health and disease. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an accurate, fully automated 3D histology reconstruction method to visualize the arterioles and venules within the mouse hind-limb. Sections of the tibialis anterior muscle from C57BL/J6 mice (both normal and subjected to femoral artery excision) were reconstructed using pairwise rigid and affine registrations of 5 \u03bcm-thick, paraffin-embedded serial sections digitized at 0.25 \u03bcm/pixel. Low-resolution intensity-based rigid registration was used to initialize the nucleus landmark-based registration, and conventional high-resolution intensity-based registration method. The affine nucleus landmark-based registration was developed in this work and was compared to the conventional affine high-resolution intensity-based registration method. Target registration errors were measured between adjacent tissue sections (pairwise error), as well as with respect to a 3D reference reconstruction (accumulated error, to capture propagation of error through the stack of sections). Accumulated error measures were lower (p<0.01) for the nucleus landmark technique and superior vasculature continuity was observed. These findings indicate that registration based on automatic extraction and correspondence of small, homologous landmarks may support accurate 3D histology reconstruction. This technique avoids the otherwise problematic \"banana-into-cylinder\" effect observed using conventional methods that optimize the pairwise alignment of salient structures, forcing them to be section-orthogonal. This approach will provide a valuable tool for high-accuracy 3D histology tissue reconstructions for analysis of diseased microvasculature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microvessels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932627505", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56193054700": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "56193054700", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario"}, "35495232000": {"Name": "Pickering J.G.", "AuthorID": "35495232000", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario"}, "56004945900": {"Name": "Arpino J.M.", "AuthorID": "56004945900", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario"}, "8590897600": {"Name": "Ward A.D.", "AuthorID": "8590897600", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Western Ontario"}, "6602001435": {"Name": "Nong Z.", "AuthorID": "6602001435", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario"}, "36026807300": {"Name": "Gibson E.", "AuthorID": "36026807300", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario"}, "55007277900": {"Name": "Yin H.", "AuthorID": "55007277900", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario"}}}
