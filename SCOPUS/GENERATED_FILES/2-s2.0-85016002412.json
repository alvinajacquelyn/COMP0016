We demonstrate that conditional deletion of the DYT1 dystonia protein torsinA in embryonic progenitors of forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons causes dystonic-like twisting movements that emerge during juvenile CNS maturation. The onset of these movements coincides with selective degeneration of dorsal striatal large cholinergic interneurons (LCI), and surviving LCI exhibit morphological, electrophysiological, and connectivity abnormalities. Consistent with the importance of this LCI pathology, murine dystoniclike movements are reduced significantly with an antimuscarinic agent used clinically, and we identify cholinergic abnormalities in postmortem striatal tissue from DYT1 dystonia patients. These findings demonstrate that dorsal LCI have a unique requirement for torsinA function during striatal maturation, and link abnormalities of these cells to dystonic-like movements in an overtly symptomatic animal model.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cholinergic Neurons", "Corpus Striatum", "Dystonia", "Gene Deletion", "Mice", "Molecular Chaperones", "Movement", "Prosencephalon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016002412", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24169164000": {"Name": "Pappas S.S.", "AuthorID": "24169164000", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan"}, "56699768800": {"Name": "Darr K.", "AuthorID": "56699768800", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan"}, "56700242800": {"Name": "LeWitt T.M.", "AuthorID": "56700242800", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan"}, "6602164026": {"Name": "Dauer W.T.", "AuthorID": "6602164026", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan"}, "54892995800": {"Name": "Holley S.M.", "AuthorID": "54892995800", "AffiliationID": "60006511, 60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center, Brain Research Institute, Semel Institute for Neuroscience, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "7005275495": {"Name": "Cepeda C.", "AuthorID": "7005275495", "AffiliationID": "60006511, 60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center, Brain Research Institute, Semel Institute for Neuroscience, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "56457232500": {"Name": "Levine M.S.", "AuthorID": "56457232500", "AffiliationID": "60006511, 60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center, Brain Research Institute, Semel Institute for Neuroscience, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "6507997482": {"Name": "Mabrouk O.S.", "AuthorID": "6507997482", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan"}, "56416924600": {"Name": "Wong J.M.T.", "AuthorID": "56416924600", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan"}, "7402555882": {"Name": "Kennedy R.T.", "AuthorID": "7402555882", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan"}, "26531765900": {"Name": "Paudel R.", "AuthorID": "26531765900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
