Despite this considerable variation in practice exists. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical relevance and a ranking order for the diagnostic criteria in DDH amongst paediatric orthopaedic surgeons practicing in the UK. Method: One hundred members of the British Society of Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) were asked to rate the importance of 37 criteria useful in the diagnosis of DDH in newborns, using a 10 cm visual analogue scale. We determined the consistency among specialists in rating the criteria with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and compared the results to a group of international peers. Results: Ortolani/Barlow tests, asymmetry in abduction \u226420\u00b0 and a first-degree relative treated for DDH ranked among the top ten. Participants demonstrated poor consistency in rating the 37 criteria (ICC 0.39; 95 % CI 0.29, 0.52), but for clinical examination criteria alone their consistency improved (ICC 0.52; 0.35, 0.75). The importance ratings of members of BSCOS and members of the European Paediatric Orthopaedic Society differed for 15/37 (41 %) criteria (p <0.05). Conclusions: Members of BSCOS had a preference for criteria relating to clinical examination and ultrasound.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Developmental", "Diagnosis", "Dysplasia", "Hip"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hip Dislocation, Congenital", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Medicine", "Pediatrics", "Physical Examination", "Societies, Medical", "Specialization", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955123040", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56323470600": {"Name": "Williams D.", "AuthorID": "56323470600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6603924672": {"Name": "Roposch A.", "AuthorID": "6603924672", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "55623426100": {"Name": "Protopapa E.", "AuthorID": "55623426100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "26533456000": {"Name": "Stohr K.", "AuthorID": "26533456000", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7403250933": {"Name": "Hunter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403250933", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospital"}}}
