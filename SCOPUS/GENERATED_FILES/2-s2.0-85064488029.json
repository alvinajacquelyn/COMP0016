Here, we use a combination of anion photoelectron spectroscopy experiments and quantum chemistry calculations to probe the electronic structure of the CFP chromophore in its deprotonated anionic form. The vertical detachment energy measured as the maximum in the photoelectron spectrum is \u00b1 eV, which is an improvement on our earlier measurement. We see evidence for competing internal conversion following resonant excitation of electronically excited states of the anion lying in the detachment continuum. We find that the first electronically excited valence state of the anion lies very close to the detachment threshold, supporting the conclusions of gas-phase photodestruction action spectroscopy measurements, and that the second electronically excited valence state lies around 1.25 eV above the detachment threshold. These electronic states have shape resonance character and mixed excited shape and Feshbach resonance character, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anion photoelectron spectroscopy", "autodetachment", "fluorescent proteins", "photochemistry", "photophysics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anion photoelectron spectroscopy", "Autodetachment", "Electronically excited state", "Fluorescence resonance energy transfer", "Fluorescent protein", "Live-cell fluorescence imaging", "Quantum chemistry calculations", "Vertical detachment energies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064488029", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"8839107300": {"Name": "Parkes M.", "AuthorID": "8839107300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57208331742": {"Name": "Bennett A.", "AuthorID": "57208331742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
