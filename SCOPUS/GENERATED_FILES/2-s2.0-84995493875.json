The lesion was first noted after a fall, and grew steadily in size following further head injury during pregnancy. Initial plain radiography demonstrated an area of radiolucency, with subsequent cross-sectional imaging revealing the extent of the lesion. Following successful surgical resection, histological features were suggestive of an aggressive osteoblastoma with aneurysmal bone cyst-like changes. We consider the influence of pregnancy and trauma on osteoblastoma behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aneurysmal bone cyst", "Osteoblastoma", "Pregnancy", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Cysts, Aneurysmal", "Bone Neoplasms", "Female", "Frontal Bone", "Humans", "Osteoblastoma", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic", "Radiography", "Wounds and Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995493875", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55892641800": {"Name": "Toescu S.M.", "AuthorID": "55892641800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56548872100": {"Name": "Alalade A.F.", "AuthorID": "56548872100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56995719200": {"Name": "Steele L.", "AuthorID": "56995719200", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Royal London Hospital"}, "24480643900": {"Name": "Bhargava D.", "AuthorID": "24480643900", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Royal London Hospital"}, "25652775700": {"Name": "Hunter R.", "AuthorID": "25652775700", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Royal London Hospital"}}}
