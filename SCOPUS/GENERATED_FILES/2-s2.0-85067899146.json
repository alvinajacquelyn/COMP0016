Departing from existing analysis of policies and the public sector, we use policy mobility framing to critically engage with the strategies of the private sector. We analyse King\u2019s Cross\u2019 arrival in two large-scale redevelopments: Brussels\u2019 Tour and Taxis and Johannesburg\u2019s Modderfontein, questioning how it was referred to, the success of its deployment and the politics of urban learning. We draw three main conclusions: first, the comparison demonstrates private sector agency in their ability to shape the way expert knowledge arrives. Second, we argue that private sector actors require locally embedded practices and tacit knowledge to leverage international points of reference in their projects. Third, in placing the analytical gaze from the perspective of the project \u2018arriving\u2019 and adopting a specifically comparative approach, we reveal the myriad of possibilities developers and consultants face and the politics of what they pick from each. Theoretically, these conclusions draw from economic geography\u2019s politics of learning and mobility research to demonstrate the benefit of analysis that traces a project, rather an idea or a policy, and from \u2018arriving at\u2019 and the subsequent assembling of different project components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brussels", "Johannesburg", "London", "Project mobility", "real estate developers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067899146", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57202505774": {"Name": "Brill F.", "AuthorID": "57202505774", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55226677100": {"Name": "Conte V.", "AuthorID": "55226677100", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "University of Milano-Bicocca"}}}
