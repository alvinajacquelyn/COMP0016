The specimen preparation device can cement two separate aluminium hemispheres by epoxy adhesive with accurate size control. The auxiliary loading devices can carry out compression, tension, shear, bending and torsion tests and any of their combinations. The experimental results show that the peak shear force, bending moment and torque of the bonded hemispheres are normal force dependent; that is, they first increase with the normal force and then decrease after the normal force exceeds a critical value.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical value", "Epoxy adhesives", "Loading devices", "Mechanical contact", "Normal forces", "Size control", "Three-dimensional contact", "Threedimensional (3-d)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946615924", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56056887900": {"Name": "Jiang M.J.", "AuthorID": "56056887900", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geotechnical Engineering, College of Civil Engineering, Tongji University"}, "56621864400": {"Name": "Jin S.L.", "AuthorID": "56621864400", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geotechnical Engineering, College of Civil Engineering, Tongji University"}, "39262680900": {"Name": "Shen Z.F.", "AuthorID": "39262680900", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geotechnical Engineering, College of Civil Engineering, Tongji University"}, "56198997600": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56198997600", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geotechnical Engineering, College of Civil Engineering, Tongji University"}, "12243933700": {"Name": "Coop M.R.", "AuthorID": "12243933700", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "City University of Hong Kong"}}}
