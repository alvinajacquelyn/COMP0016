All rights reserved.The noble gases are the most inert group of the periodic table, but their reactivity increases with pressure. Diamond-anvil-cell experiments and ab initio modelling have been used to investigate a possible direct reaction between xenon and oxygen at high pressures. We have now synthesized two oxides below 100 GPa (Xe 2 O 5 under oxygen-rich conditions, and Xe 3 O 2 under oxygen-poor conditions), which shows that xenon is more reactive under pressure than predicted previously. Xe 2 O 5 was observed using X-ray diffraction methods, its structure identified through ab initio random structure searching and confirmed using X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopies. The experiments confirm the recent prediction of Xe 3 O 2 as a stable xenon oxide under high pressure. Xenon atoms adopt mixed oxidation states of 0 and +4 in Xe 3 O 2 and +4 and +6 in Xe 2 O 5. Xe 3 O 2 and Xe 2 O 5 form extended networks that incorporate oxygen-sharing XeO 4 squares, and Xe 2 O 5 additionally incorporates oxygen-sharing XeO 5 pyramids. Other xenon oxides (XeO 2, XeO 3) are expected to form at higher pressures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979210911", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57205904039": {"Name": "Dewaele A.", "AuthorID": "57205904039", "AffiliationID": "60007816", "AffiliationName": "CEA, DAM, DIF"}, "57214406354": {"Name": "Worth N.", "AuthorID": "57214406354", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "TCM Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7003406428": {"Name": "Needs R.J.", "AuthorID": "7003406428", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "TCM Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7006725779": {"Name": "Pickard C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006725779", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University"}, "7004644372": {"Name": "Pascarelli S.", "AuthorID": "7004644372", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "8351143700": {"Name": "Mathon O.", "AuthorID": "8351143700", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "7003799217": {"Name": "Mezouar M.", "AuthorID": "7003799217", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "7006490638": {"Name": "Irifune T.", "AuthorID": "7006490638", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}}}
