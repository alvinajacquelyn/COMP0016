They allow direct or paracrine/autocrine cell communication through their channel and hemi-channel functions. They enable adhesion and interact with a plethora of signalling molecules. Here, we review the common themes in developmental and pathological processes and we focus in their involvement in cell migration in four different systems: neurons, astrocytes, neural crest and cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Cell migration", "Connexin", "Development", "Polarity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Carcinogenesis", "Cell Communication", "Cell Movement", "Connexins", "Embryonic Development", "Gap Junctions", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms", "Neural Crest", "Neurons", "Protein Structure, Tertiary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927969292", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55962819200": {"Name": "Kotini M.", "AuthorID": "55962819200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7003927871": {"Name": "Mayor R.", "AuthorID": "7003927871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
