The performance of the HCW system is benchmarked against the traditional reinforced concrete coupled wall (RCW). Nonlinear numerical models are developed in OpenSees for a representative wall elevation in a prototype 11-story building designed per modern Chinese codes. Performance is assessed via nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results indicate that both systems can adequately meet code defined objectives in terms of global and component behavior. Behavior of the two systems is consistent under service level earthquakes, whereas under more extreme events, the HCW system illustrates enhanced performance over the RCW system resulting in peak interstory drifts up to 31% lower in the HCW than the RCW. Larger drifts in the RCW are because of reduced coupling action induced by stiffness degradation of RC coupling beams, whereas the stable hysteretic responses and overstrength of RSCBs benefit post-yield behavior of the HCW. Under extreme events, the maximum beam rotations of the RSCBs are up to 42% smaller than those of the RC coupling beams. Moderate to severe damage is expected in the RC coupling beams, whereas the RSCBs sustain damage to the slab above the beam and possible web buckling of shear links. The assessment illustrates the benefits of the HCW with RSCBs over the RCW system, because of easy replacement of the shear links as opposed to costly and time-consuming repairs of RC coupling beams.
