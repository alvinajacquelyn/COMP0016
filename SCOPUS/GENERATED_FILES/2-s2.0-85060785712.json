The input data is given from a cheap RGB-D range sensor, such as the ASUS Xtion PRO. To achieve this, we have implemented a 3D version of the impressive OpenPose package, which was recently developed. The first stage of our method contains the execution of the OpenPose Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), using a sequence of RGB images as input. The extracted human skeleton pose localisation in two-dimensions (2D) is followed by the mapping of the extracted joint location estimations into their 3D pose in the camera frame. The output of this process is then used as input to drive the end-pose of the robotic hands relative to the human hand movements, through a whole-body inverse kinematics process in the Cartesian space. Finally, we implement the method as a ROS wrapper package and we test it on the centaur-like CENTAURO robot. Our demonstrated task is of a box and lever manipulation in real-time, as a result of a human task demonstration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Articulated robots", "Cartesian Space", "Convolutional neural network", "Joint locations", "Skeleton extraction", "Teleoperation systems", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Two dimensions (2D)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060785712", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57205618982": {"Name": "Rolley-Parnell E.J.", "AuthorID": "57205618982", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "University of Plymouth, Drake Circus"}, "26023306800": {"Name": "Kanoulas D.", "AuthorID": "26023306800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "57194457730": {"Name": "Laurenzi A.", "AuthorID": "57194457730", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "57191253109": {"Name": "Delhaisse B.", "AuthorID": "57191253109", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "36603179000": {"Name": "Rozo L.", "AuthorID": "36603179000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "7202685497": {"Name": "Caldwell D.G.", "AuthorID": "7202685497", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "56275172000": {"Name": "Tsagarakis N.G.", "AuthorID": "56275172000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}}}
