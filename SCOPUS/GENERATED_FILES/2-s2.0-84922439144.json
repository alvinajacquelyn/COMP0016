We investigated whether PTSD sufferers show impaired allocentric spatial processing indicative of reduced hippocampal functioning.Trauma-exposed individuals with (. N=. 29) and without (. N=. 30) a diagnosis of PTSD completed two tests of spatial processing: a topographical recognition task comprising perceptual and memory components, and a test of memory for objects' locations within a virtual environment in which the test is from either the same viewpoint as presentation (solvable with egocentric memory) or a different viewpoint (requiring allocentric memory).Participants in the PTSD group performed significantly worse on allocentric spatial processing than trauma-exposed controls. Groups performed comparably on egocentric memory and non-spatial memory for lists of objects. Exposure to repeated incident trauma was also associated with significantly worse spatial processing in the PTSD group.Results show a selective impairment in allocentric spatial processing, implicating weak hippocampal functioning, as predicted by a neurobiological dual representation model of PTSD. These findings have important clinical implications for cognitive therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allocentric memory", "Hippocampus", "PTSD", "Spatial memory", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Space Perception", "Spatial Memory", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922439144", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57202492512": {"Name": "Smith K.V.", "AuthorID": "57202492512", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7404245327": {"Name": "King J.A.", "AuthorID": "7404245327", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
