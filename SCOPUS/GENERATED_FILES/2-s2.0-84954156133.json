We distinguish between a main sequence of dissociation that involves PH2+H, PH+2H, and P+3H as observable intermediates, and a secondary sequence that gives rise to PH+H, P+2H, and isolated phosphorus adatoms. The latter sequence arises because PH2 fragments are surprisingly mobile on Si(001) and can diffuse away from the third hydrogen atom that makes up the PH3 stoichiometry. Our calculated activation energies describe the competition between diffusion and dissociation pathways and hence provide a comprehensive model for the numerous adsorbate species observed in STM experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Comprehensive model", "Dissociation pathways", "Hydrogen atoms", "Image data", "Reaction paths", "Si(0 0 1)", "Si(001) surfaces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954156133", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"6602002254": {"Name": "Warschkow O.", "AuthorID": "6602002254", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of Sydney"}, "7101779863": {"Name": "Marks N.A.", "AuthorID": "7101779863", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Physics and Astronomy, Curtin University"}, "14219916700": {"Name": "Wilson H.F.", "AuthorID": "14219916700", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Sciences, RMIT University"}, "7202304965": {"Name": "McKenzie D.R.", "AuthorID": "7202304965", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of Sydney"}, "6701786801": {"Name": "Curson N.J.", "AuthorID": "6701786801", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006018442": {"Name": "Schofield S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006018442", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "57206036358": {"Name": "Reusch T.C.G.", "AuthorID": "57206036358", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}, "55424718000": {"Name": "Simmons M.Y.", "AuthorID": "55424718000", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}, "7003875227": {"Name": "Radny M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003875227", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle"}, "7406991934": {"Name": "Smith P.V.", "AuthorID": "7406991934", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle"}}}
