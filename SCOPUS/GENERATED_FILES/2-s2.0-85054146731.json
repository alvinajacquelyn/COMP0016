Here, we demonstrate that leptin-induced depolarization of POMC neurons is associated with the augmentation of a voltage-gated calcium (CaV) conductance with the properties of the \u201cR-type\u201d channel. Knockdown of the pore-forming subunit of the R-type (CaV2.3 or Cacna1e) conductance in hypothalamic POMC neurons prevented sustained leptin-induced depolarization. In vivo POMC-specific Cacna1e knockdown increased hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance, while body weight, feeding, or leptin-induced suppression of food intake were not changed. These findings link Cacna1e function to leptin-mediated POMC neuron excitability and glucose homeostasis and may provide a target for the treatment of diabetes. Smith et al. show that an R-type calcium channel containing the pore subunit Cacna1e mediates long-term depolarization of hypothalamic POMC neurons by leptin. Mice with POMC neuron knockdown of Cacna1e display elevated hepatic glucose production, demonstrating that leptin utilizes Cacna1e in POMC neurons to regulate glucose homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calcium channel", "diabetes", "glucose", "hypothalamus", "insulin resistance", "leptin", "liver", "POMC neuron"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, R-Type", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Glucose", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Hypothalamus", "Leptin", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Pro-Opiomelanocortin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054146731", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56911323100": {"Name": "Smith M.A.", "AuthorID": "56911323100", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Signalling Group, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "43161109200": {"Name": "Katsouri L.", "AuthorID": "43161109200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "12645589100": {"Name": "Choudhury A.I.", "AuthorID": "12645589100", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Signalling Group, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "7005989616": {"Name": "Withers D.J.", "AuthorID": "7005989616", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "8447660100": {"Name": "Virtue S.", "AuthorID": "8447660100", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Research Laboratories, Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge"}, "57193020341": {"Name": "Vidal-Puig A.", "AuthorID": "57193020341", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Research Laboratories, Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge"}, "7005244619": {"Name": "Ashford M.L.J.", "AuthorID": "7005244619", "AffiliationID": "60171138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee"}}}
