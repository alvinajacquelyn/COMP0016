Method: 7,115 men and women of age 45-72 years participated in the initial survey in 2006-2008. In 2016 the follow-up survey was performed among all 6,210 participants who survived. 4,266 individuals responded to postal questionnaires. PWB was evaluated by using CASP-12 questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by CES-D-10 scale. Quality of life, self-rated health, and social activity were evaluated.Socio-demographic, socio-economic factors were included into standard questionnaire. Results: PWB deteriorated in all age groups during 10-years follow-up. Poor quality of life, poor self-rated health, having depressive symptoms, and not being member of social organization are associated with lower PWB after 10 years in men and women. Employed-retired, retired, and not socially active women have higher possibility to have lower PWB over 10 years. Conclusions: PWB in older Lithuanian city dwellers deteriorates as many other socio-economic and psychosocial indicators during ten-year follow-up. Mostly psychosocial factors, but not the socio-demographic, and socio-economic ones predict PWB over 10 years. It is crucial to understand and promote predictors of PWB in older age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohort study", "Psychological well-being", "Psychosocial factors", "Socio-demographic factors", "Socio-economic factors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048888122", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"55503855700": {"Name": "Sapranaviciute-Zabazlajeva L.", "AuthorID": "55503855700", "AffiliationID": "60109642", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Psychology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "12779256900": {"Name": "Luksiene D.", "AuthorID": "12779256900", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "57196263385": {"Name": "Virviciute D.", "AuthorID": "57196263385", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "35724244600": {"Name": "Kranciukaite-Butylkiniene D.", "AuthorID": "35724244600", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "57211811198": {"Name": "Tamosiunas A.", "AuthorID": "57211811198", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
