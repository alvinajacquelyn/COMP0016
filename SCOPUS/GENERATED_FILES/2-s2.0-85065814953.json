Methods We analyzed Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) biomarkers in CSF taken from 3565 patients referred to 18 French memory clinics. Patients were classified into four profiles according to levels of CSF biomarkers (A: amyloidosis, N: neurodegeneration). The association between CSF Tau and CSF A\u03b242 were analyzed using general linear regression models, in the overall population and stratified by biomarkers profiles. We compared linear and quadratic models using Akaike information criterion. We also assessed change in biomarker profiles in a subset of patients who had 2 assessments of biomarkers. Results CSF Tau was negatively associated with CSF A\u03b242 in the overall population, following a non-linear quadratic model. However, the nature of this association was different in the 4 profiles: positive association in A-N- profile, negative association in A-N+ and A+N+ profiles, lack of association in A+N- patients. When considering patients with longitudinal data on profiles, 36% of those initially classified as A-N+ evolved to an A+N+ profile. Conclusions The nature of the association between CSF A\u03b242 and CFS Tau depends on the A/N profiles of patients. These results suggest an increase in CSF A\u03b242 early in the disease before its decline while tau pathology progresses, this pattern is particularly observed in non-APOE4 subjects. This phenomenon may explain why some patients with neurodegeneration only markers convert to an AD profile (A+N+) over time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloidosis", "Apolipoproteins E", "Biomarkers", "Cognition Disorders", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Progression", "Female", "France", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Peptide Fragments", "Regression Analysis", "Spinal Puncture", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065814953", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57208797258": {"Name": "Mohamed Lafirdeen A.S.", "AuthorID": "57208797258", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurology Center, Saint Louis\u2014Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "24586845400": {"Name": "Cognat E.", "AuthorID": "24586845400", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurology Center, Saint Louis\u2014Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "57208077196": {"Name": "Hourregue C.", "AuthorID": "57208077196", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurology Center, Saint Louis\u2014Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "7801546447": {"Name": "Lilamand M.", "AuthorID": "7801546447", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurology Center, Saint Louis\u2014Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "7103202992": {"Name": "Hugon J.", "AuthorID": "7103202992", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurology Center, Saint Louis\u2014Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "23502231800": {"Name": "Paquet C.", "AuthorID": "23502231800", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurology Center, Saint Louis\u2014Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "35242229200": {"Name": "Dumurgier J.", "AuthorID": "35242229200", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, CRESS, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "24339408800": {"Name": "Sabia S.", "AuthorID": "24339408800", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, CRESS, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "23049197900": {"Name": "Dugravot A.", "AuthorID": "23049197900", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, CRESS, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56958575600": {"Name": "Bouaziz-Amar E.", "AuthorID": "56958575600", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of biochemistry, Saint Louis -Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP"}, "35435127600": {"Name": "Laplanche J.L.", "AuthorID": "35435127600", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of biochemistry, Saint Louis -Lariboisiere\u2014Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP"}}}
