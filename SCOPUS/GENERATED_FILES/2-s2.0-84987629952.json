Our results show that genetic purging efficiently removes the inbreeding load of both lethal and non-lethal mutations, reducing the amount of inbreeding depression relative to that expected without selection. We find that the minimum effective population size to avoid severe inbreeding depression in the short term is of the order of N e \u224870 for a wide range of species' reproductive rates. We also carried out simulations of captive breeding populations where two contrasting management methods are performed, one avoiding inbreeding (equalisation of parental contributions (EC)) and the other forcing it (circular sib mating (CM)). We show that, for the inbreeding loads considered, CM leads to unacceptably high extinction risks and, as a result, to lower genetic diversity than EC. Thus we conclude that methods aimed at enhancing purging by intentional inbreeding should not be generally advised in captive breeding conservation programmes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Breeding", "Computer Simulation", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Population", "Inbreeding", "Models, Genetic", "Mutation", "Population Density"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987629952", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7101915989": {"Name": "Caballero A.", "AuthorID": "7101915989", "AffiliationID": "60026134", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, Gen\u00e9tica e Inmunolog\u00eda, Facultad de Biolog\u00eda, Universidad de Vigo"}, "57191160578": {"Name": "Bravo I.", "AuthorID": "57191160578", "AffiliationID": "60026134", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, Gen\u00e9tica e Inmunolog\u00eda, Facultad de Biolog\u00eda, Universidad de Vigo"}, "57202341952": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57202341952", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
