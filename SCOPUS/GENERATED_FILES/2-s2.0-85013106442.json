Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been detected primarily in pharmaceutical drugs, personal care products, food additives, and food containers. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been associated with a high incidence and prevalence of many endocrine-related disorders in humans. Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to establish a correlation between exposure to EDC and human disorders. Conventional detection of EDCs is based on chemical structure and concentration sample analysis. However, substantial evidence has emerged, suggesting that cell exposure to EDCs leads to epigenetic changes, independently of its chemical structure with non-monotonic low-dose responses. Consequently, a paradigm shift in toxicology assessment of EDCs is proposed based on a comprehensive review of analytical techniques used to evaluate the epigenetic effects. Fundamental insights reported elsewhere are compared in order to establish DNA methylation analysis as a viable method for assessing endocrine disruptors beyond the conventional study approach of chemical structure and concentration analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endocrine-disrupting chemicals", "Epigenetic analysis", "Monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "DNA Methylation", "Endocrine Disruptors", "Environmental Exposure", "Environmental Pollutants", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Reproduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013106442", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"55793367500": {"Name": "Tapia-Orozco N.", "AuthorID": "55793367500", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Alimentos y Biotecnolog\u00eda, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "16686287700": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Arrazola R.", "AuthorID": "16686287700", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Alimentos y Biotecnolog\u00eda, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "57193339218": {"Name": "Santiago-Toledo G.", "AuthorID": "57193339218", "AffiliationID": "118110114", "AffiliationName": "Abraxas Biolabs SAPI de CV"}, "57193331788": {"Name": "Barr\u00f3n V.", "AuthorID": "57193331788", "AffiliationID": "60015684", "AffiliationName": "Unidad de Medicina Gen\u00f3mica, Hospital General de M\u00e9xico"}, "57193340960": {"Name": "Espinosa-Garc\u00eda A.M.", "AuthorID": "57193340960", "AffiliationID": "60015684", "AffiliationName": "Unidad de Medicina Gen\u00f3mica, Hospital General de M\u00e9xico"}, "7102375194": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102375194", "AffiliationID": "60015684", "AffiliationName": "Unidad de Medicina Gen\u00f3mica, Hospital General de M\u00e9xico"}}}
