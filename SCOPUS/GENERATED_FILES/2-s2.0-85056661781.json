This has been driven by some national reviews forecasting a national reduction of costs by \u00a3250-\u00a3500 million ($315-$630 million) a year as a result. The main aim of this paper is to describe the financial impact of such consolidation, with a specific focus on the forecasted savings. A secondary aim is to describe the development of private sector involvement in laboratory services in a traditionally publicly funded healthcare system and the development of pathology staff size. Methods: In the English scenario, the majority of hospitals and laboratories are publicly funded and a survey was sent as Freedom of Information request to all directors of pathology. A descriptive comparison of savings among consolidated and non-consolidated pathology services was made by using the pathology budgets in two different periods (2015 versus 2010), adjusted by inflation and increased activity. Results: The hub-and-spoke model has been implemented as part of the consolidation process of pathology services in England. Consolidated pathology networks have achieved higher savings compared to non-consolidated single laboratories. There has been an increased role of private providers and savings were achieved with negligible personnel redundancies. Conclusions: Consolidated units have on average achieved larger cost savings than non-consolidated units but further analysis with stronger research design is required to independently evaluate the impact of pathology consolidation on both savings and quality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consolidation of pathology services", "England", "Savings"], "IndexKeywords": ["Budgets", "Cost Savings", "Economics, Hospital", "England", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Laboratories", "Pathology, Clinical", "Private Sector", "Public Sector", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056661781", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"25626807100": {"Name": "Satta G.", "AuthorID": "25626807100", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7004500458": {"Name": "Edmonstone J.", "AuthorID": "7004500458", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy and Professional Practice, University of Keele"}}}
