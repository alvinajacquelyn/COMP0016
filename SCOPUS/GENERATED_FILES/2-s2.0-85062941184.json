We prospectively collected pharmacokinetic data aiming to describe pharmacokinetics and determine covariates contributing to the variability in neonatal vancomycin pharmacokinetics. Further, we aimed to use the model to compare the ratio of AUC24 at steady-state to the MIC (AUC24,ss/MIC) of several intermittent and continuous dosing regimens. Methods: Newborns receiving vancomycin for suspected or confirmed late-onset sepsis were included. Peak and trough concentrations for intermittent vancomycin dosing and steady-state concentrations for continuous vancomycin dosing were measured. NONMEM 7.3 was used for population pharmacokinetic analysis. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare dosing schemes. Results: Data from 54 infants were used for model development and from 34 infants for the model evaluation {corrected gestational age [median (range)]=29 (23.7-41.9) weeks and 28 (23.4-41.7) weeks, respectively}. The final model was a one-compartment model. Weight and postmenstrual age were included a priori, and then no additional covariate significantly improved the model fit. Final model parameter estimates [mean (SEM)]: CL=5.7 (0.3) L/h/70 kg and V=39.3 (3.7) L/70kg. Visual predictive check of the evaluation dataset confirmed themodel can predict external data. Simulations using MIC of 1mg/L showed that for neonates with gestational age \u226425 weeks and postnatal age < 2weeks AUC24,ss/MIC was lower with the intermittent regimen (median 482 versus 663). Conclusions: A population pharmacokinetic model for continuous and intermittent vancomycin administration in infants was developed. Continuous administration might be favourable for treating infections caused by resistant microorganisms in very young and immature infants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Area Under Curve", "Drug Monitoring", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Models, Theoretical", "Organ Specificity", "Vancomycin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062941184", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57209232260": {"Name": "Germovsek E.", "AuthorID": "57209232260", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University"}, "57190131343": {"Name": "Busquets F.B.", "AuthorID": "57190131343", "AffiliationID": "107929358", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Passeig Hospital Sant Joan de Deu 2"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation, Infection and Rheumatology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57201341205": {"Name": "Osborne L.", "AuthorID": "57201341205", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57197877225": {"Name": "Sinha A.K.", "AuthorID": "57197877225", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Blizard Institute, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57207823905": {"Name": "Gunaratnam F.", "AuthorID": "57207823905", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Blizard Institute, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57207822835": {"Name": "Lounis S.A.", "AuthorID": "57207822835", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Blizard Institute, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
