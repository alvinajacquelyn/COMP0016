The aim of this study was to assess safety, efficacy and impact on quality of life of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation in neurological patients reporting overactive bladder symptoms. Methods: In this retrospective evaluation over 18 months at a tertiary healthcare centre, patients finding first-line treatments for overactive bladder ineffective or intolerable underwent a standard 12-week course of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (Urgent PC, Uroplasty). Symptoms were evaluated using standardised International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires and bladder diaries. Results: Of 74 patients (52 women, 22 men, mean age 56 years), 49 (66.2%) patients had neurological disorder [19 (25.7%) multiple sclerosis and 30 (40.5%) other neurological conditions] and 25 (33.8%) idiopathic overactive bladder. Overall for the entire cohort significant improvements were recorded after 12 weeks in the following domains: 24-h frequency on bladder diary \u2212 1.67 (\u2212 3.0, 0.33) (p = 0.002), number of incontinent episodes on bladder diary \u2212 0.0 (\u2212 1, 0) (p = 0.01), incontinence severity on bladder diary 0 (\u2212 0.33, 0) (p = 0.007), OAB symptoms \u2212 3 (\u2212 11.5, 5) (p = 0.01), and quality of life \u2212 16 (\u2212 57, 6.5) (p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in outcomes between patients with idiopathic and neurogenic overactive bladder. Conclusions: Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation appears to be a possible promising alternative for patients with neurological disorder reporting overactive bladder symptoms who find first-line treatments either ineffective or intolerable. However, a properly designed study is required to address safety and efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lower urinary tract symptoms", "Multiple sclerosis", "Overactive bladder", "Percutaneous electric nerve stimulation", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051631773", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"8692298900": {"Name": "Tudor K.I.", "AuthorID": "8692298900", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Center Zagreb"}, "46062438500": {"Name": "Seth J.H.", "AuthorID": "46062438500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36878890500": {"Name": "Liechti M.D.", "AuthorID": "36878890500", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60000869", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center, University of Zurich, Balgrist University Hospital"}, "57203413215": {"Name": "Ochulor J.", "AuthorID": "57203413215", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15623104100": {"Name": "Gonzales G.", "AuthorID": "15623104100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8243945700": {"Name": "Haslam C.", "AuthorID": "8243945700", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57027548400": {"Name": "Fox Z.", "AuthorID": "57027548400", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Group, University College London Hospitals and University College London Research Support Centre, University College London"}}}
