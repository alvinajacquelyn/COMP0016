Methods: In this prospective study, both eyes of 31 participants with AMD were included. The subjects underwent scanning with an OCT prototype and a spectraldomain OCT to compare the accuracy of the central retinal thickness (CRT) measurements. Results: Sixty-two eyes in 31 participants (21 females and 10 males) were included. The mean age was 79.6 years (age range, 69\u201392 years). The mean difference in the CRT measurements between the devices was 4.52 \u00b5m (SD \u00b1 20.0 \u00b5m; range, -65.6 to 41.5 \u00b5m). The inter- and intrarater reliability coefficients of the OCT prototype were both >0.95. The laser power delivered was <0.54 mW for spOCT and <1.4 mW for SDOCT. No adverse events were reported, and the visual acuity before and after the measurements was stable. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of this home-based OCT monitoring under real-life conditions, and it provided evidence for the potential clinical benefit of the device. Translational Relevance: The newly developed spOCT is a valid and readily available retina scanner. It could be applied as a portable self-measuring OCT system. Its use may facilitate the sustainable monitoring of chronic retinal diseases by providing easily accessible and continuous retinal monitoring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Monitoring", "Optical coherence tomography", "Retina"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051269915", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"6507518152": {"Name": "Maloca P.", "AuthorID": "6507518152", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "18037277400": {"Name": "Hasler P.W.", "AuthorID": "18037277400", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of Basel, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "12797735000": {"Name": "Barthelmes D.", "AuthorID": "12797735000", "AffiliationID": "60013933, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Save Sight Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "35077378800": {"Name": "Zweifel S.A.", "AuthorID": "35077378800", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "University of Zurich, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital"}, "56789575600": {"Name": "Arnold P.", "AuthorID": "56789575600", "AffiliationID": "60099391", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences Engineering and Information Technology, Institute for Human Centered Engineering OptoLab"}, "57203321544": {"Name": "Matthias M.", "AuthorID": "57203321544", "AffiliationID": "60099391", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences Engineering and Information Technology, Institute for Human Centered Engineering OptoLab"}, "7006706337": {"Name": "Scholl H.P.N.", "AuthorID": "7006706337", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7005480328": {"Name": "Gerding H.", "AuthorID": "7005480328", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Augenklinik der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster"}, "7006639200": {"Name": "Garweg J.", "AuthorID": "7006639200", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60027608", "AffiliationName": "Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital, University of Bern"}, "55555386500": {"Name": "Heeren T.", "AuthorID": "55555386500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203321880": {"Name": "Emanuel Ramos de Carvalho J.", "AuthorID": "57203321880", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
