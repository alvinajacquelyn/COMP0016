Methods: A cross disciplinary method is applied that uses the sequences of short-term features of EEG to grade an hour long recording. Novel post-processing techniques are proposed based on majority voting and probabilistic methods. The proposed system is validated with one-hour-long EEG recordings from 54 full term neonates. Results: An overall accuracy of 87% is achieved. The developed grading system has improved both the accuracy and the confidence/quality of the produced decision. With a new label 'unknown' assigned to the recordings with lower confidence levels an accuracy of 96% is attained. Conclusion: The statistical long-term model based features extracted from the sequences of short-term features has improved the overall accuracy of grading the HIE injury in neonatal EEG. Significance: The proposed automated HIE grading system can provide significant assistance to healthcare professionals in assessing the severity of HIE. This represents a practical and user friendly implementation which acts as a decision support system in the clinical environment. Its integration with other EEG analysis algorithms may improve neonatal neurocritical care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated neonatal HIE EEG grading system", "EEG", "EEG analysis algorithms", "Gaussian mixture models", "Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy", "Long term EEG features", "Neonatal EEG", "Support vector machine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Support Vector Machine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933556401", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57193818940": {"Name": "Ahmed R.", "AuthorID": "57193818940", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College Cork"}, "12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College Cork"}, "36832339300": {"Name": "Marnane W.", "AuthorID": "36832339300", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College Cork"}, "7003406304": {"Name": "Lightbody G.", "AuthorID": "7003406304", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}}}
