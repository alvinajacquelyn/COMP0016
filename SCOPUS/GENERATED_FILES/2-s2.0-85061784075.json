All Rights Reserved.We study the convex geometry of certain invariant manifolds, known as carrying simplices, for 3-species competitive Kolmogorov-type maps. We show that if all planes whose normal bundles are contained in a fixed closed and solid convex cone are rendered convex (concave) surfaces by the map, then, if there is a carrying simplex, it is a convex (concave) surface. We apply our results to the May-Leonard map.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carrying simplex", "Concavity", "Convexity", "Invariant manifold", "May-Leonard map"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061784075", "SubjectAreas": [["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"6701473676": {"Name": "Baigent S.", "AuthorID": "6701473676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, UCL"}}}
