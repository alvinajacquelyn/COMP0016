The eye and retinal morphology of eight commonly caught trawl bycatch species were described: Lepidotrigla mulhalli; Lophonectes gallus; Platycephalus bassensis; Sillago flindersi; Neoplatycephalus richardsoni Thamnaconus degeni Parequula melbournensis; and Trachurus declivis. The cone densities ranged from 38 cones per 0.01mm2 for S. flindersi to 235 cones per 0.01mm2 for P. melbournensis. The rod densities ranged from 22800 cells per 0.01mm2 for L. mulhalli to 76634 cells per 0.01 mm2 for T. declivis and potential visual acuity (based on anatomical measures) ranged from 0.08 in L. gallus to 0.31 in P. melbournensis. Higher rod densities were correlated with maximum habitat depths. Six species had the regular pattern of four double cones arranged around a single cone in the photoreceptor mosaic, while T. declivis had only rows of double cones. P. melbournensis had the greatest potential ability for detecting fine detail based on eye anatomy. The potential visual acuity estimates and rod densities can be applied to suggest the relative detection ability of different species in a commercial fishing context, since vision is a critical sense in an illuminated environment for perceiving an oncoming trawl.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cone density", "Cone mosaic", "Minimum separable angle", "Potential visual acuity", "Rod density"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "Cell Count", "Eye", "Fishes", "Lens, Crystalline", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells", "Vision, Ocular", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928138504", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"56599777500": {"Name": "Hunt D.E.", "AuthorID": "56599777500", "AffiliationID": "60190740, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Northern Hub, Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania"}, "6701458144": {"Name": "Rawlinson N.J.F.", "AuthorID": "6701458144", "AffiliationID": "60190740, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Northern Hub, Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania"}, "57193658212": {"Name": "Thomas G.A.", "AuthorID": "57193658212", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507430171": {"Name": "Cobcroft J.M.", "AuthorID": "6507430171", "AffiliationID": "60032607", "AffiliationName": "University of the Sunshine Coast"}}}
