Published by Oxford University Press Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.Background: The Lablite project captured information on access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) at larger health facilities ('hubs') and lower-level health facilities ('spokes') in Phalombe district, Malawi and in Kalungu district, Uganda. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among patients who had transferred to a spoke after treatment initiation (Malawi, n=54; Uganda, n=33), patients who initiated treatment at a spoke (Malawi, n=50; Uganda, n=44) and patients receiving treatment at a hub (Malawi, n=44; Uganda, n=46). Results: In Malawi, 47% of patients mapped to the two lowest wealth quintiles (Q1-Q2); patients at spokes were poorer than at a hub (57% vs 23% in Q1-Q2; p<0.001). In Uganda, 7% of patients mapped to Q1-Q2; patients at the rural spoke were poorer than at the two peri-urban facilities (15% vs 4% in Q1-Q2; p<0.001). The median travel time one way to a current ART facility was 60 min (IQR 30-120) in Malawi and 30 min (IQR 20-60) in Uganda. Patients who had transferred to the spokes reported a median reduction in travel time of 90 min in Malawi and 30 min in Uganda, with reductions in distance and food costs. Conclusions: Decentralizing ART improves access to treatment. Community-level access to treatment should be considered to further minimize costs and time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral Therapy", "Decentralization", "Equity", "HIV Services", "Malawi", "Patient Costs", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Malawi", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Politics", "Primary Health Care", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042605213", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"26321047000": {"Name": "Abongomera G.", "AuthorID": "26321047000", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp"}, "6602918610": {"Name": "Kityo C.", "AuthorID": "6602918610", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "35301739400": {"Name": "Colebunders R.", "AuthorID": "35301739400", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp"}, "24537111400": {"Name": "Chiwaula L.", "AuthorID": "24537111400", "AffiliationID": "60072660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Malawi"}, "44461911800": {"Name": "Nkhata M.", "AuthorID": "44461911800", "AffiliationID": "60111561", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Research Department, Dignitas International"}, "55243350600": {"Name": "Cataldo F.", "AuthorID": "55243350600", "AffiliationID": "60111561", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Research Department, Dignitas International"}, "57200920232": {"Name": "van Oosterhoutc J.", "AuthorID": "57200920232", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "37121626600": {"Name": "Chan A.", "AuthorID": "37121626600", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60029150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Partment of Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto"}, "57193543168": {"Name": "Revill P.", "AuthorID": "57193543168", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "55855324800": {"Name": "Mabugu T.", "AuthorID": "55855324800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Centre, University of Zimbabwe"}, "7102948186": {"Name": "Hakim J.", "AuthorID": "7102948186", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Centre, University of Zimbabwe"}, "57196184963": {"Name": "Tumwesige E.", "AuthorID": "57196184963", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Sciences, Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "7005429371": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "7005429371", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57200911757": {"Name": "Gilksj C.", "AuthorID": "57200911757", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health, University of Queensland"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7401568316": {"Name": "Ford D.", "AuthorID": "7401568316", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
