The first channel of contagion is counterparty failure risk; this is captured empirically using data for the Austrian interbank network. The second channel of contagion is overlapping portfolio exposures; this is studied using a stylized model. We perform stress tests according to different protocols. For the parameters we study neither channel of contagion results in large effects on its own. In contrast, when both channels are active at once, bankruptcies are much more common and have large systemic effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contagion", "Network models", "Systemic risk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920261207", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"24775109100": {"Name": "Caccioli F.", "AuthorID": "24775109100", "AffiliationID": "60120737, 60112768, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Risk Studies, Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge"}, "16143273100": {"Name": "Farmer J.D.", "AuthorID": "16143273100", "AffiliationID": "60175816, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, Mathematical Institute, Oxford University"}, "38961174000": {"Name": "Foti N.", "AuthorID": "38961174000", "AffiliationID": "60030961", "AffiliationName": "Santa Fe Institute"}, "6603901581": {"Name": "Rockmore D.", "AuthorID": "6603901581", "AffiliationID": "60010756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Dartmouth College"}}}
