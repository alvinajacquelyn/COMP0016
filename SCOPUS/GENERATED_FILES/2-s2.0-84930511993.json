A biomimetic approach for the chemical synthesis of a wide array of 1-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines was undertaken with the aim of elucidating a common pharmacophore for these compounds with novel mode(s) of anti-TB action. Methods: Biomimetic Pictet-Spengler or Bischler-Napieralski synthetic routes were employed followed by an evaluation of the biological activity of the synthesized compounds. Results: In this work, the synthesized tetrahydroisoquinolines were found to inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and affect its whole-cell phenotype as well as the activity of the ATP-dependent MurE ligase, a key enzyme involved in the early stage of cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Conclusions: As the correlation between the MIC and the half-inhibitory enzymatic concentration was not particularly strong, there is a credible possibility that these compounds have pleiotropic mechanism(s) of action in M. tuberculosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aporphine alkaloids", "Cell wall peptidoglycan", "Drug resistance", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "SPOTi", "TB", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Bacterial Proteins", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Peptide Synthases", "Tetrahydroisoquinolines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930511993", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"37031058500": {"Name": "Guzman J.D.", "AuthorID": "37031058500", "AffiliationID": "60054319", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda, Universidad del Norte"}, "56670757100": {"Name": "Davies H.M.", "AuthorID": "56670757100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "56670941200": {"Name": "McMahon E.", "AuthorID": "56670941200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36880628000": {"Name": "Evangelopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "36880628000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "56950542300": {"Name": "Mortazavi P.N.", "AuthorID": "56950542300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36818894600": {"Name": "Munshi T.", "AuthorID": "36818894600", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Infection and Immunity Research Institute, St George's, University of London"}, "55831167600": {"Name": "Maitra A.", "AuthorID": "55831167600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6701498589": {"Name": "Bhakta S.", "AuthorID": "6701498589", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "23489862800": {"Name": "Pesnot T.", "AuthorID": "23489862800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56512302800": {"Name": "Lamming E.D.", "AuthorID": "56512302800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56670966700": {"Name": "Barrera D.A.", "AuthorID": "56670966700", "AffiliationID": "60055696", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional de Colombia"}, "6507815754": {"Name": "Cuca L.E.", "AuthorID": "6507815754", "AffiliationID": "60055696", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional de Colombia"}, "7006304705": {"Name": "Angell R.", "AuthorID": "7006304705", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery Group, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery Group, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "15055605300": {"Name": "Gershater M.C.", "AuthorID": "15055605300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13906963600": {"Name": "Redmond J.M.", "AuthorID": "13906963600", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, GlaxoSmithKline Medicines Research Centre"}, "7102365595": {"Name": "Needham D.", "AuthorID": "7102365595", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, GlaxoSmithKline Medicines Research Centre"}}}
