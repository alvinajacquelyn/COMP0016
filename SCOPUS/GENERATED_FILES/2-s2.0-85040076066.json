Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjectives: To compare the radiographic bone changes, clinical parameters and aesthetic outcomes of immediately provisionalised and conventionally restored implants at 12- and 24-months post-implant placement. Material and methods: In 24 patients, 24 bone level implants with a hydrophilic (SLActive) surface were placed in healed sites and they were either immediately provisionalised with a non-occluding temporary crown (test group) or left without a crown (control group). In both groups, the definitive restoration was placed 16 weeks after implant placement. Clinical and radiographic parameters were calculated at 12- and 24-months post-implant placement, together with implant success/survival rates according to three different sets of criteria. The aesthetic outcome was evaluated through the Papilla Fill Index and the Pink Aesthetic Score. Results: The mean marginal bone loss at 1 year was \u22120.73 mm (SD 0.83 mm) in the test group and \u22120.22 mm (SD 0.46 mm) in the control group (p >.05). Whilst 100% survival rate and positive aesthetic outcomes were recorded in both groups, three patients of the test group did not fulfil all success criteria. Conclusions: Immediate provisionalisation may represent a viable option for the replacement of single missing teeth, with radiographic, clinical and aesthetic results comparable to those of conventionally loaded implants at 2 years of follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bone level implants", "dental implants", "hydrophilic surface", "immediate provisionalisation", "immediate restoration", "implant loading", "modSLA", "randomised controlled trial", "SLActive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alveolar Bone Loss", "Analysis of Variance", "Crowns", "Dental Implantation, Endosseous", "Dental Implants, Single-Tooth", "Esthetics, Dental", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Immediate Dental Implant Loading", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Radiography, Dental", "Single-Blind Method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040076066", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}, "56395450800": {"Name": "Calciolari E.", "AuthorID": "56395450800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}, "56015030400": {"Name": "Horvath A.", "AuthorID": "56015030400", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Semmelweis University"}, "37057608500": {"Name": "Mezzomo L.", "AuthorID": "37057608500", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry, Federal University of Santa Catarina"}, "57200182121": {"Name": "Dedi D.", "AuthorID": "57200182121", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Continuing Professional Development, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6506529769": {"Name": "Mardas N.", "AuthorID": "6506529769", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Adult Oral Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}}}
