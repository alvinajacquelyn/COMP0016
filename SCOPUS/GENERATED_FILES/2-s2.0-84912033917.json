To answer this question, we need some explicit standards about demoi-cracy. In fact, open co-ordination serves three different but interrelated purposes in European Union policy: to facilitate convergence; to support learning processes; and to encourage exploration of policy innovation. By intersecting standards and purposes, we find open co-ordination is neither inherently \u2018good\u2019 nor \u2018bad\u2019 for demoi-cracy, as it depends on how it has been put into practice. Therefore, we qualify the answer considering the empirical evidence on how normative principles hit the road of implementation. In the final part of this paper, we look into the demoi-cratic effects of the Eurozone's economic and financial crisis on our findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["comparative public policy", "Democracy", "demoicracy", "European Union", "open method of co-ordination"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912033917", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"6701483595": {"Name": "Borr\u00e1s S.", "AuthorID": "6701483595", "AffiliationID": "60020188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Business and Politics, Copenhagen Business School"}, "6701387604": {"Name": "Radaelli C.", "AuthorID": "6701387604", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Exeter"}}}
