Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Whilst the role of the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene in the aetiology of major mental illnesses is debated, the characterization of its function lends it credibility as a candidate. A key aspect of this functional characterization is the determination of the role of common non-synonymous polymorphisms on normal variation within these functions. The common allele (A) of the DISC1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs821616 encodes a serine (ser) at the Ser704Cys polymorphism, and has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) that stimulate the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that human ser (A) homozygotes would show elevated dopamine synthesis capacity compared with cysteine (cys) homozygotes and heterozygotes (TT and AT) for rs821616. [18F]-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) was used to index striatal dopamine synthesis capacity as the influx rate constant Kicer in healthy volunteers DISC1 rs821616 ser homozygotes (N = 46) and healthy volunteers DISC1 rs821616 cys homozygotes and heterozygotes (N = 56), matched for age, gender, ethnicity and using three scanners. We found DISC1 rs821616 ser homozygotes exhibited a significantly higher striatal Kicer compared with cys homozygotes and heterozygotes (P = 0.012) explaining 6.4% of the variance (partial n2 = 0.064). Our finding is consistent with its previous association with heightened activation of ERK1/2, which stimulates tyrosine hydroxylase activity for dopamine synthesis. This could be a potential mechanism mediating risk for psychosis, lending further credibility to the fact that DISC1 is of functional interest in the aetiology of major mental illness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Corpus Striatum", "Dihydroxyphenylalanine", "Dopamine", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054364723", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57199081751": {"Name": "Dahoun T.", "AuthorID": "57199081751", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "55774659600": {"Name": "Bloomfield M.A.P.", "AuthorID": "55774659600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6603588360": {"Name": "Jauhar S.", "AuthorID": "6603588360", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King\u2019s College London"}, "26040450300": {"Name": "Bonoldi I.", "AuthorID": "26040450300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King\u2019s College London"}, "6602176923": {"Name": "Howes O.D.", "AuthorID": "6602176923", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King\u2019s College London"}, "35741635700": {"Name": "Pardi\u00f1as A.F.", "AuthorID": "35741635700", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "16023594900": {"Name": "Walters J.", "AuthorID": "16023594900", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "36487315800": {"Name": "Veronese M.", "AuthorID": "36487315800", "AffiliationID": "101281611", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences"}, "6602919436": {"Name": "Nosarti C.", "AuthorID": "6602919436", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, Centre for the Developing Brain, King\u2019s College London"}, "55327988700": {"Name": "Froudist-Walsh S.", "AuthorID": "55327988700", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Science, New York University"}, "6603961427": {"Name": "Korth C.", "AuthorID": "6603961427", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department Neuropathology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "6506305368": {"Name": "Hennah W.", "AuthorID": "6506305368", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Medicum, University of Helsinki"}, "14632352500": {"Name": "Prata D.", "AuthorID": "14632352500", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Cis-IUL"}}}
