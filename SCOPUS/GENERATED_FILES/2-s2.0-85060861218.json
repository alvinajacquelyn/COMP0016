In this paper, we report an electrically pumped continuous-wave (CW) 1.3 \u00b5m InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) lasers grown on a complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) compatible Si exact (0 0 1) substrate with reduced GaAs buffer thickness down to \u223c2 \u00b5m. A threshold current density (J th ) as low as \u223c160 A/cm 2 has been achieved at room temperature. The characteristic temperature (T 0 ) obtained is \u223c60.8 K and laser operation is observed up to 52 \u00b0C under CW mode. These results suggest that an O-band InAs/GaAs QD laser could be very promising to develop a monolithically integrated on-chip optical source for Si photonics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A1.
