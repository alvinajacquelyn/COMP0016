This study aimed to assess the provision of GH education and opportunities for international exchange during neurology post-graduate training with a focus on Europe. Methods: We developed a questionnaire covering different aspects of and interest in GH education on behalf of the European Association of Young Neurologists and Trainees. Residents in neurology and junior neurologists (RJN) were approached to complete this survey. Results: Completed questionnaires were returned by 131 RJNs, of whom 65.7% were women and 84.0% were between 26 and 35 years old. In total, almost one-third (29.0%) of RJNs reported that their residency programs offered training in GH. Limited education was reported for women's or children's health and neurological disorders of immigrants and refugees, as only 22.1%, 25.2% and 22.1% of RJNs reported that such training was offered, respectively. The curriculum rarely included coverage of the global impact of neurological disorders. Definite plans to volunteer in a developing country were reported by 7.6%. The majority of the participants acknowledged the importance of GH training and international exchange during post-graduate education. Conclusion: This survey corroborates the interest in and appreciation of GH education by European RJNs. However, there are shortcomings in training and opportunities for international exchange. Academic neurology and international bodies, including the European Academy of Neurology, are requested to address this.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Europe", "global health", "neurology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Europe", "Global Health", "Health Education", "Humans", "Internship and Residency", "Neurologists", "Neurology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991658395", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54894616700": {"Name": "Sauerbier A.", "AuthorID": "54894616700", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London and King's College Hospital"}, "35722502400": {"Name": "Macerollo A.", "AuthorID": "35722502400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College of London"}, "55623778100": {"Name": "Gy\u00f6rfi O.", "AuthorID": "55623778100", "AffiliationID": "60018248", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Psychiatry and Addictions, Ny\u00edr\u0151 Gyula Hospital"}, "55345294900": {"Name": "Balicza P.", "AuthorID": "55345294900", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genomic Medicine and Rare Disorders, Semmelweis University"}, "56200843100": {"Name": "Moarcas M.", "AuthorID": "56200843100", "AffiliationID": "114918639", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Emergency Clinical County Hospital Brasov"}, "56646336500": {"Name": "Papp V.", "AuthorID": "56646336500", "AffiliationID": "60021804", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Holstebro Hospital"}, "57199650314": {"Name": "Zis P.", "AuthorID": "57199650314", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "55652077700": {"Name": "Klingelhoefer L.", "AuthorID": "55652077700", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Technical University Dresden"}, "36651432300": {"Name": "Saifee T.", "AuthorID": "36651432300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, Neurology"}, "55883219000": {"Name": "Struhal W.", "AuthorID": "55883219000", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology 2, Medical Campus III, Kepler University Clinic"}, "6603278912": {"Name": "Sellner J.", "AuthorID": "6603278912", "AffiliationID": "60014976", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian Doppler Medical Center, Paracelsus Medical University"}}}
