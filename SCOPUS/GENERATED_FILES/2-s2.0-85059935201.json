Largely, the focus of this journal has been on the transmissive aspect of forensic imaging, and therefore a significant number of high-quality case studies have been published focusing on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. As a result, the \u2018and imaging\u2019 aspect is often neglected. Since 2013, technology has fundamentally evolved, and a number of new techniques have become accessible or have been demonstrated as particularly useful within many sub-disciplines of forensic science. These include active and passive surface scanning techniques, and the availability of three-dimensional printing. Therefore, this article discusses non-contact techniques, their applications, advantages, and considerations on the current state of play of imaging in forensic science.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bias", "Courtroom", "Data", "Ethics", "Evidence", "Imaging", "Non-Contact", "Three-dimension", "Visualisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059935201", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57204121486": {"Name": "Carew R.M.", "AuthorID": "57204121486", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55661632700": {"Name": "Errickson D.", "AuthorID": "55661632700", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield Forensic Institute, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Cranfield University"}}}
