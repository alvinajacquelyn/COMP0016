It relies on the formation of a seal between the soft tissues and the implant and currently has a flange with drilled holes to promote dermal attachment. Despite this, infection remains a significant risk. This study explored alternative strategies to enhance soft-tissue integration. Materials and Methods: The effect of ITAP pins with a fully porous titanium alloy flange with interconnected pores on soft-tissue integration was investigated. The flanges were coated with fibronectin-functionalised hydroxyapatite and silver coatings, which have been shown to have an antibacterial effect, while also promoting viable fibroblast growth in vitro. The ITAP pins were implanted along the length of ovine tibias, and histological assessment was undertaken four weeks post-operatively. Results: The porous titanium alloy flange reduced epithelial downgrowth and increased soft-tissue integration compared with the current drilled flange. The addition of coatings did not enhance these effects. Conclusion: These results indicate that a fully porous titanium alloy flange has the potential to increase the soft-tissue seal around ITAP and reduce susceptibility to infection compared with the current design.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alloys", "Amputation Stumps", "Animals", "Artificial Limbs", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Durapatite", "Fibronectins", "Materials Testing", "Osseointegration", "Porosity", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Fitting", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "Sheep", "Silver", "Surface Properties", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017558431", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"36550164000": {"Name": "Chimutengwende-Gordon M.", "AuthorID": "36550164000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6507506415": {"Name": "Pendegrass C.", "AuthorID": "6507506415", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7004735871": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "7004735871", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
