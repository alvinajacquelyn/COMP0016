Published by BMJ.Objective To determine if the detection of physical abuse in young children with fractures is of uniform high standard in the East Anglia Region of the UK, and whether we can identify areas for improvement in our detection of high-risk groups. Design Multicentre retrospective 4-year study. Setting 7 hospitals across the East Anglia Region of Britain (East Anglia Paediatric Physical Abuse and Fractures study). Participants Age groups and fractures indicated as being at higher risk for physical abuse (all children under 12 months of age, and fractures of humerus and femur in children under 36 months of age). Outcome measures Our criterion for physical abuse was the decision of a multiagency child protection case conference (CPCC). Results Probability of CPCC decision of physical abuse was highest in infants, ranging from 50% of fractures sustained in the first month of life (excluding obstetric injuries) to 10% at 12 months of age. Only 46%-86% of infants (under 12 months) with a fracture were assessed by a paediatrician for physical abuse after their fracture. Significant variation in the use of skeletal surveys and in CPCC decision of physical abuse was noted in children attending different hospitals. Conclusions It is a concern that significant variation between hospitals was found in the investigation and detection of physical abuse as confirmed by CPCC decisions. To minimise failure to detect true cases of physical abuse, we recommend that all high-risk children should be assessed by a paediatrician prior to discharge from the emergency department. Our proposed criteria for assessment (where we found probability of CPCC decision of physical abuse was at least 10%) are any child under the age of 12 months with any fracture, under 18 months of age with femur fracture and under 24 months with humeral shaft fracture (not supracondylar).", "AuthorKeywords": ["child abuse", "child protection", "fracture", "inflicted injury", "musculoskeletal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child Abuse", "Child Protective Services", "Clinical Audit", "Femoral Fractures", "Humans", "Humeral Fractures", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Pediatricians", "Physical Abuse", "Referral and Consultation", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059918270", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57208011103": {"Name": "Mitchell P.D.", "AuthorID": "57208011103", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "56459828300": {"Name": "Latimer M.", "AuthorID": "56459828300", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "57203057316": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "57203057316", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "52265072000": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "52265072000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55255267100": {"Name": "Shah R.D.", "AuthorID": "55255267100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "8622648300": {"Name": "Samworth R.J.", "AuthorID": "8622648300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57197086593": {"Name": "Deakin S.", "AuthorID": "57197086593", "AffiliationID": "60014768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, West Suffolk Hospital"}, "57190029294": {"Name": "Wright G.M.", "AuthorID": "57190029294", "AffiliationID": "60014768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, West Suffolk Hospital"}, "57189306203": {"Name": "Edge P.", "AuthorID": "57189306203", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Bedford Hospital NHS Trust"}, "36338254600": {"Name": "Qasim S.", "AuthorID": "36338254600", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Bedford Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57205407575": {"Name": "Hudson I.", "AuthorID": "57205407575", "AffiliationID": "60029684", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Ipswich Hospital"}, "56514046700": {"Name": "Tissingh E.", "AuthorID": "56514046700", "AffiliationID": "60029684", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Ipswich Hospital"}, "57205407743": {"Name": "Hutchinson R.", "AuthorID": "57205407743", "AffiliationID": "60008089", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Norfolk and Norwich Hospital"}, "56259059500": {"Name": "Sanghrajka A.", "AuthorID": "56259059500", "AffiliationID": "60008089", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Norfolk and Norwich Hospital"}, "26533456000": {"Name": "Stohr K.", "AuthorID": "26533456000", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7003772709": {"Name": "Rehm A.", "AuthorID": "7003772709", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7203044162": {"Name": "Natarajan R.", "AuthorID": "7203044162", "AffiliationID": "60023346", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Northampton General Hospital"}}}
