The reorganization energy, which is a measure of the free-energy change associated with solute and solvent rearrangements, is a key quantity for calculating rate constants for these reactions. We present a computational method for including the effects of the double layer and ionic environment of the diffuse layer in calculations of electrochemical solvent reorganization energies. This approach incorporates an accurate electronic charge distribution of the solute within a molecular-shaped cavity in conjunction with a dielectric continuum treatment of the solvent, ions, and electrode using the integral equations formalism polarizable continuum model. The molecule-solvent boundary is treated explicitly, but the effects of the electrode-double layer and double layer-diffuse layer boundaries, as well as the effects of the ionic strength of the solvent, are included through an external Green's function. The calculated total reorganization energies agree well with experimentally measured values for a series of electrochemical systems, and the effects of including both the double layer and ionic environment are found to be very small. This general approach was also extended to electrochemical PCET and produced total reorganization energies in close agreement with experimental values for two experimentally studied PCET systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975068664", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57220950529": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "57220950529", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "6603087073": {"Name": "Soudackov A.V.", "AuthorID": "6603087073", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "7004505104": {"Name": "Hammes-Schiffer S.", "AuthorID": "7004505104", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}}}
