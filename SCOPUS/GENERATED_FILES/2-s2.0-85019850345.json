Here, we characterize cone differentiation in retinas derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Similar to in vivo development, a temporal pattern of progenitor marker expression is followed by the differentiation of early thyroid hormone receptor \u03b22-positive precursors and, subsequently, photoreceptors exhibiting cone-specific phototransduction-related proteins. We establish that stage-specific inhibition of the Notch pathway increases cone cell differentiation, while retinoic acid signaling regulates cone maturation, comparable with their actions in vivo. MESC-derived cones can be isolated in large numbers and transplanted into adult mouse eyes, showing capacity to survive and mature in the subretinal space of Aipl1\u2212/\u2212 mice, a model of end-stage retinal degeneration. Together, this work identifies a robust, renewable cell source for cone replacement by purified cell suspension transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blindness", "cell- and tissue-based therapy", "mouse embryonic stem cells", "retina", "retinal cone photoreceptor cells", "retinal degeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "Cell Differentiation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Eye Proteins", "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 6", "Leukemia Inhibitory Factor", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells", "Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2", "Opsins", "Orphan Nuclear Receptors", "Otx Transcription Factors", "Receptors, Notch", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Degeneration", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction", "Tretinoin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019850345", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55233580000": {"Name": "Kruczek K.", "AuthorID": "55233580000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "50261517000": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Cordero A.", "AuthorID": "50261517000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57191406239": {"Name": "Goh D.", "AuthorID": "57191406239", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55851051300": {"Name": "Naeem A.", "AuthorID": "55851051300", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57192692124": {"Name": "Jonikas M.", "AuthorID": "57192692124", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55851566200": {"Name": "Blackford S.J.I.", "AuthorID": "55851566200", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57191408440": {"Name": "Kloc M.", "AuthorID": "57191408440", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "12770759900": {"Name": "Duran Y.", "AuthorID": "12770759900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701653389": {"Name": "Georgiadis A.", "AuthorID": "6701653389", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56318714600": {"Name": "Sampson R.D.", "AuthorID": "56318714600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56955647900": {"Name": "Maswood R.N.", "AuthorID": "56955647900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57203012241": {"Name": "Smith A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203012241", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56275466000": {"Name": "Pearson R.A.", "AuthorID": "56275466000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36702150800": {"Name": "West E.L.", "AuthorID": "36702150800", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14524230600": {"Name": "Decembrini S.", "AuthorID": "14524230600", "AffiliationID": "60000239, 60030219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne"}, "57205954456": {"Name": "Arsenijevic Y.", "AuthorID": "57205954456", "AffiliationID": "60000239, 60030219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne"}, "35556156400": {"Name": "Sowden J.C.", "AuthorID": "35556156400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
