We evaluated for the first time the performance of a new type of interferon-\u03b3 release assay, QuantiFERONTB Plus (QFT-Plus), which includes an additional antigen tube (TB2), stimulating both CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells in contacts of TB patients. Contacts were screened for latent TB infection by tuberculin skin test, QFT-Plus and QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-GIT). In 119 TB contacts, the overall agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT was high, with a Cohen's \u03ba of 0.8. Discordant results were found in 12 subjects with negative QFT-GIT and positive QFT-Plus results. In analyses of markers of TB exposure and test results, the average time spent with the index case was the strongest risk factor for positivity in each of these tests. The difference in interferon-\u03b3 production between the two antigen tubes (TB2-TB1) was used as an estimate of CD8+ stimulation provided by the TB2. TB2-TB1 values >0.6 IU\u00b7mL-1 were significantly associated with proximity to the index case and European origin. QFT-Plus has a stronger association with surrogate measures of TB exposure than QFT-GIT in adults screened for latent TB infection. Interferon-\u03b3 response in the new antigen tube used an indirect estimate of specific CD8+ response correlates with increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure, suggesting a possible role in identifying individuals with recent infection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Contact Tracing", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Interferon-gamma", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Italy", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculin Test", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994335143", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57189364989": {"Name": "Barcellini L.", "AuthorID": "57189364989", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "14059423200": {"Name": "Borroni E.", "AuthorID": "14059423200", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "57191853684": {"Name": "Russo G.", "AuthorID": "57191853684", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7005158262": {"Name": "Cirillo D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005158262", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "55547124592": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124592", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Trust and UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Trust and UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7003794243": {"Name": "Brunetti E.", "AuthorID": "7003794243", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Infectious Diseases, San Matteo Hospital Foundation, University of Pavia"}, "57191859103": {"Name": "Campisi D.", "AuthorID": "57191859103", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Regional TB Reference Centre and Laboratory, Villa Marelli Institute/Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital"}, "57191863143": {"Name": "Castellotti P.F.", "AuthorID": "57191863143", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Regional TB Reference Centre and Laboratory, Villa Marelli Institute/Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital"}, "6603665951": {"Name": "Codecasa L.R.", "AuthorID": "6603665951", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Regional TB Reference Centre and Laboratory, Villa Marelli Institute/Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital"}, "9637639200": {"Name": "Ferrarese M.", "AuthorID": "9637639200", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Regional TB Reference Centre and Laboratory, Villa Marelli Institute/Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital"}, "57113708000": {"Name": "Cugnata F.", "AuthorID": "57113708000", "AffiliationID": "60009622", "AffiliationName": "University Centre of Statistics for Biomedical Sciences (CUSSB), Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "18433571700": {"Name": "Di Serio C.", "AuthorID": "18433571700", "AffiliationID": "60009622", "AffiliationName": "University Centre of Statistics for Biomedical Sciences (CUSSB), Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "24177108800": {"Name": "Rancoita P.M.V.", "AuthorID": "24177108800", "AffiliationID": "60009622", "AffiliationName": "University Centre of Statistics for Biomedical Sciences (CUSSB), Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "7004262091": {"Name": "Goletti D.", "AuthorID": "7004262091", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Research Unit, Epidemiology Dept, National Institute for Infectious Diseases"}, "6602902675": {"Name": "Tadolini M.", "AuthorID": "6602902675", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Dept of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna"}, "55192477700": {"Name": "Vanino E.", "AuthorID": "55192477700", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Dept of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna"}}}
