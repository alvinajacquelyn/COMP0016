However, the extent to which different levels of insight explain variations in somatization remains understudied. This study aimed to evaluate whether high-level emotional awareness (comprehension) but not low-level awareness (only attention) is needed to psychologically cope with suffering, thus leading to lower somatization. Specific predictions were: 1) High attention along with High comprehension will be associated with significantly lower frequency of somatic complaints than other combinations (Low attention and Low comprehension, or High attention but Low comprehension); 2) In absence of comprehension, no attention will be more optimal than attention only, because only-attention might work as an amplificatory of suffering without the possibility of processing it. Self-reports of meta-cognitive processes, somatization, and control variables were obtained from 264 adolescents from a non-clinical population (54.5% female; aged 12\u201318, M = 14.7, SD = 1.7). In line with expectations, results revealed significant differences in the effects of insight positions on somatization: Attention+Comprehension (M = 4.9, SE = 0.9) < Nothing (M = 7.1, SE = 0.3) < Only attention (M = 8.9, SE = 0.7). Compared to Nothing, Attention+comprehension was associated with significantly reduced somatic complaints (B = -2.2, p = 0.03, 95% CI -4,1 to 0.2). However, Only attention was associated with increased somatic complaints compared to the other two conditions (B = 1.8, p = 0.03, 95% CI 0.2 to 3.4; B = 4, CI 95% 1.6\u20136.3, p = 0.001, respectively). This highlights the role of higher-order awareness (i.e., comprehension or clarity) in the processing of suffering and stresses its value in the adaptive coping of emotional distress.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Attention", "Awareness", "Child", "Comprehension", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mentalization", "Psychological Distress", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065569193", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6506552670": {"Name": "Ballesp\u00ed S.", "AuthorID": "6506552670", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "57208707666": {"Name": "Alonso N.", "AuthorID": "57208707666", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "57208709407": {"Name": "Ram\u00edrez M.S.", "AuthorID": "57208709407", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "6507516897": {"Name": "Barrantes-Vidal N.", "AuthorID": "6507516897", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Research Network on Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "14625711500": {"Name": "Vives J.", "AuthorID": "14625711500", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychobiology and Methodology of Health Sciences, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "13003363700": {"Name": "Sharp C.", "AuthorID": "13003363700", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Houston"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Lang Sciences, University College London"}}}
