Using data from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), self-reported diabetes was determined either in response to a direct question at five follow-ups between 1977 and 2010, or from other self-reported medical information. A validation questionnaire was sent to the GP for all participants who reported a diagnosis of diabetes and gave permission to contact their GP (172). The validity of self-reported diabetes was assessed by calculating the percentage of self-reported diabetes cases that were confirmed by their GP, i.e. the positive predictive value (PPV). The difference between self-reported and GP-confirmed age at diagnosis was analysed with a Bland-Altman plot. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 157 GPs (91.2%). Of these, 149 confirmed their patient self-reported diabetes diagnosis (PPV = 94.9%). Results were similar when self-reported diabetes was assessed by responses to direct questions only (PPV = 95.4%). The average difference between self-reported and GP-reported age at diagnosis was 0.6 years (95% CI 0.2-1.1). We conclude that among the British population questionnaires are a valid method to assess GP-diagnosed diabetes, as measured by responses to a direct question or by patient-reported medical information.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Questionnaire", "Self-reported", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "General Practice", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Report", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941179739", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56261869000": {"Name": "Pastorino S.", "AuthorID": "56261869000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "56262035400": {"Name": "Abington J.", "AuthorID": "56262035400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "26323396400": {"Name": "Wills A.", "AuthorID": "26323396400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "7102752919": {"Name": "Pierce M.", "AuthorID": "7102752919", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}}}
