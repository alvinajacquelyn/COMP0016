However, ethnic minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials of OCD. It is unclear whether this is also the case in clinical services. Aims To explore whether ethnic minorities with OCD are underrepresented in secondary and tertiary mental health services in the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Method The ethnic distribution of patients with OCD seen between 1999 and 2013 in SLaM (n = 1528) was compared with that of the general population in the catchment area using census data. A cohort of patients with depression (n = 22 716) was used for comparative purposes. Results Ethnic minorities with OCD were severely underrepresented across services (757%, 95% CI 762% to 752%). The magnitude of the observed inequalities was significantly more pronounced than in depression (729%, 95% CI731% to727%). Conclusions There is a clear need to understand the reasons behind such ethnic inequalities and implement measures to reduce them.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Depressive Disorder", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Ethnic Groups", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "London", "Mental Health Services", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Registries", "Secondary Care Centers", "Tertiary Care Centers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949818859", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57190882020": {"Name": "Fernandez de la Cruz L.", "AuthorID": "57190882020", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Child and Adolescent Research Center"}, "56919445200": {"Name": "Llorens M.", "AuthorID": "56919445200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "35275280100": {"Name": "Krebs G.", "AuthorID": "35275280100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "56453252900": {"Name": "Vidal-Ribas P.", "AuthorID": "56453252900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "34868485200": {"Name": "Radua J.", "AuthorID": "34868485200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "22957853600": {"Name": "Hatch S.", "AuthorID": "22957853600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "7006858005": {"Name": "Bhugra D.", "AuthorID": "7006858005", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "56464653100": {"Name": "Clark B.", "AuthorID": "56464653100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "7004084003": {"Name": "Mataix-Cols D.", "AuthorID": "7004084003", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "6503937463": {"Name": "Jassi A.", "AuthorID": "6503937463", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "National and Specialist OCD Clinic for Young People, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
