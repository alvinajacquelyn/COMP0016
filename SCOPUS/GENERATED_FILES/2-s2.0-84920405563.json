For example, microglia clear misfolded proteins, elaborate trophic factors, and regulate and terminate toxic inflammation. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, beneficial microglial functions become impaired, accelerating synaptic and neuronal loss. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to microglial dysfunction is an important objective for identifying potential strategies to delay progression to AD. The inflammatory cyclooxygenase/ prostaglandin E2 (COX/PGE2) pathway has been implicated in preclinical AD development, both in human epidemiology studies and in transgenic rodent models of AD. Here, we evaluated murine models that recapitulate microglial responses to A\u03b2 peptides and determined that microglia-specific deletion of the gene encoding the PGE2 receptor EP2 restores microglial chemotaxis and A\u03b2 clearance, suppresses toxic inflammation, increases cytoprotective insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, and prevents synaptic injury and memory deficits. Our findings indicate that EP2 signaling suppresses beneficial microglia functions that falter during AD development and suggest that inhibition of the COX/PGE2/EP2 immune pathway has potential as a strategy to restore healthy microglial function and prevent progression to AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemokines", "Chemotaxis", "Dinoprostone", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Peptide Fragments", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP2 Subtype", "Signal Transduction", "Spatial Memory", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920405563", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8654413800": {"Name": "Johansson J.", "AuthorID": "8654413800", "AffiliationID": "60000461", "AffiliationName": "SRI International"}, "36794919900": {"Name": "Woodling N.", "AuthorID": "36794919900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, University College London"}, "55628532083": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "55628532083", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "56469202900": {"Name": "Panchal M.", "AuthorID": "56469202900", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "8446813800": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "8446813800", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "42761020100": {"Name": "Brown H.", "AuthorID": "42761020100", "AffiliationID": "60014701", "AffiliationName": "Brains On-Line LLC"}, "42062047100": {"Name": "Mhatre S.", "AuthorID": "42062047100", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "55340402900": {"Name": "Loui T.", "AuthorID": "55340402900", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7003492079": {"Name": "Andreasson K.", "AuthorID": "7003492079", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "55962239100": {"Name": "Trueba-Saiz A.", "AuthorID": "55962239100", "AffiliationID": "60022146, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Functional and Systems Neurobiology Department, Cajal Institute, CSIC"}}}
