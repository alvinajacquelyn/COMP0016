Reference ranges for children in sub-Saharan Africa have not been established. The aim of this study was to establish echocardiographic z-score references for Black children in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods 282 healthy subjects aged 6\u201316 years (143 [51%] males) with no known history of cardiac disease were enrolled in the study in Harare, Zimbabwe between 2014 and 2016. Standard M-mode echocardiography was performed and nine cardiac chamber dimensions were obtained. Two non-linear statistical models (gamma weighted model and cubic polynomial model) were tested on the data and the best fitting model was used to calculate z-scores of these cardiac chamber measures. The reference ranges are presented on scatter plots against BSA. Results Normative data for the following cardiac measures were obtained and z-scores calculated: right ventricular diameter at end diastole (RVEDD); left ventricular diameter at end diastole (LVEDD) and systole (LVESD); interventricular septal wall thickness at end diastole (IVSd) and systole (IVSs); left ventricular posterior wall thickness at end diastole (LVPWd) and systole (LVPWs); left atrium diameter at end systole (LA) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). Girls had higher values for BMI and heart rate than boys (p = 0.048 and p = 0.001, respectively). Mean interventricular septal and left ventricular posterior walls thickness was higher than published normal values in predominantly Caucasian populations. Conclusion These are the first echocardiographic reference ranges for children from sub Saharan Africa and will allow accurate assessment of cardiac dimensions in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Children", "Echocardiography", "Reference ranges", "Z-scores"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Africa South of the Sahara", "African Continental Ancestry Group", "Child", "Echocardiography", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Reference Values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023157568", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55681496800": {"Name": "Majonga E.D.", "AuthorID": "55681496800", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "36461698700": {"Name": "Rehman A.M.", "AuthorID": "36461698700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23008694200": {"Name": "Kranzer K.", "AuthorID": "23008694200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14218935700": {"Name": "Ferrand R.A.", "AuthorID": "14218935700", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "56113055000": {"Name": "McHugh G.", "AuthorID": "56113055000", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "8603813100": {"Name": "Munyati S.", "AuthorID": "8603813100", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "25936533800": {"Name": "Mujuru H.A.", "AuthorID": "25936533800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe"}, "57210663714": {"Name": "Nathoo K.", "AuthorID": "57210663714", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe"}, "57194834729": {"Name": "Patel M.S.", "AuthorID": "57194834729", "AffiliationID": "118807019", "AffiliationName": "MRI & Radiology Centre"}, "7004261470": {"Name": "Odland J.O.", "AuthorID": "7004261470", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria"}, "16204898600": {"Name": "Kaski J.P.", "AuthorID": "16204898600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
