The purpose of this study was to investigate tumour thymidine concentrations and whether they correlated with [18F]FLT uptake across a broad spectrum of murine cancer models. A modified liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was used to determine endogenous thymidine concentrations in plasma and tissues of tumour-bearing and non-tumour bearing mice and rats. Thymidine concentrations were determined in 22 tumour models, including xenografts, syngeneic and spontaneous tumours, from six research centres, and a subset was compared for [18F]FLT uptake, described by the maximum and mean tumour-to-liver uptake ratio (TTL) and SUV. Results: The LC-MS/MS method used to measure thymidine in plasma and tissue was modified to improve sensitivity and reproducibility. Thymidine concentrations determined in the plasma of 7 murine strains and one rat strain were between 0.61 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcM and 2.04 \u00b1 0.64 \u03bcM, while the concentrations in 22 tumour models ranged from 0.54 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcM to 20.65 \u00b1 3.65 \u03bcM. TTL at 60 min after [18F]FLT injection, determined in 14 of the 22 tumour models, ranged from 1.07 \u00b1 0.16 to 5.22 \u00b1 0.83 for the maximum and 0.67 \u00b1 0.17 to 2.10 \u00b1 0.18 for the mean uptake. TTL did not correlate with tumour thymidine concentrations. Conclusions: Endogenous tumour thymidine concentrations alone are not predictive of [18F]FLT uptake in murine cancer models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Plasma", "Preclinical PET", "Thymidine", "Tumour", "[18F]Fluorothymidine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982152508", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"25723377600": {"Name": "Heinzmann K.", "AuthorID": "25723377600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Present address: Comprehensive Cancer Imaging Centre, Imperial College London"}, "6701564078": {"Name": "Honess D.J.", "AuthorID": "6701564078", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120009", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "55450291800": {"Name": "Lewis D.Y.", "AuthorID": "55450291800", "AffiliationID": "60172349", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre in Cambridge and Manchester"}, "7410365120": {"Name": "Smith D.M.", "AuthorID": "7410365120", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120009", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "6603857533": {"Name": "Soloviev D.", "AuthorID": "6603857533", "AffiliationID": "60172349", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre in Cambridge and Manchester"}, "57203097653": {"Name": "Griffiths J.R.", "AuthorID": "57203097653", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120009", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "7006147738": {"Name": "Brindle K.M.", "AuthorID": "7006147738", "AffiliationID": "60120009", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre"}, "8983656400": {"Name": "Cawthorne C.", "AuthorID": "8983656400", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Present address: Positron Emission Tomography Research Centre, University of Hull"}, "35412265700": {"Name": "Williams K.J.", "AuthorID": "35412265700", "AffiliationID": "60172349", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre in Cambridge and Manchester"}, "8406389200": {"Name": "Keen H.", "AuthorID": "8406389200", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Personalised Healthcare and Biomarkers, AstraZeneca"}, "26321062100": {"Name": "Heskamp S.", "AuthorID": "26321062100", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "55551362900": {"Name": "Schelhaas S.", "AuthorID": "55551362900", "AffiliationID": "60006490, 60000401", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Molecular Imaging (EIMI), Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (WWU), University Hospital of M\u00fcnster"}, "7402530967": {"Name": "Jacobs A.H.", "AuthorID": "7402530967", "AffiliationID": "60006490, 60000401", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Molecular Imaging (EIMI), Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (WWU), University Hospital of M\u00fcnster"}, "26641518000": {"Name": "Witney T.H.", "AuthorID": "26641518000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Present address: UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "7004143668": {"Name": "Aboagye E.O.", "AuthorID": "7004143668", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Cancer Imaging Centre, Imperial College London"}}}
