This issue is likely to arise in observational studies when confounders are unobserved. We are concerned with testing the hypothesis of exogeneity (or absence of endogeneity) when using regression spline recursive and sample selection bivariate probit models. Likelihood ratio and gradient tests are discussed in this context and their empirical properties investigated and compared with those of the Lagrange multiplier and Wald tests through a Monte Carlo study. The tests are illustrated using two datasets in which the hypothesis of exogeneity needs to be tested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bivariate probit model", "Endogeneity", "Gradient test", "Lagrange multiplier test", "Likelihood ratio test", "Non-random sample selection", "Penalized regression spline", "Wald test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bivariate probit", "Endogeneity", "Likelihood ratio tests", "Non-random samples", "Regression splines", "Wald test"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996605814", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"36005147900": {"Name": "Marra G.", "AuthorID": "36005147900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57192092128": {"Name": "Filippou P.", "AuthorID": "57192092128", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "23985987100": {"Name": "Radice R.", "AuthorID": "23985987100", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162130", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
