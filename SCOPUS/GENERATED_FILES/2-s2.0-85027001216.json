Although primarily transmitted through faecal contamination of food or water, transmission through sexual activity is well described, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods We investigated the prevalence of GIIs among a convenience sample of MSM who were consecutively diagnosed with rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) at 12 UK genitourinary medicine clinics during 10 weeks in 2012. Residual rectal swabs were coded, anonymised and tested for Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) using a real-time PCR. Results were linked to respective coded and anonymised clinical and demographic data. Associations were investigated using Fisher's exact tests. Results Of 444 specimens tested, overall GII prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI 6.3% to 11.6%): 1.8% (0.9% to 3.6%) tested positive for Shigella, 1.8% (0.9% to 3.6%) for Campylobacter and 5.2% (3.5% to 7.7%) for EAEC. No specimens tested positive for Salmonella or other diarrhoeagenic E. coli pathotypes. Among those with any GII, 14/30 were asymptomatic (2/7 with Shigella, 3/6 with Campylobacter and 9/17 with EAEC). Shigella prevalence was higher in MSM who were HIV-positive (4.7% (2.1% to 10.2%) vs 0.5%(0.1% to 3.2%) in HIV-negative MSM; p=0.01). Conclusions In this small feasibility study, MSM with rectal CT appeared to be at appreciable risk of GII. Asymptomatic carriage may play a role in sexual transmission of GII.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EPIDEMIOLOGY (GENERAL)", "GASTROINTESTINAL", "GAY MEN", "INFECTION"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Asymptomatic Infections", "Chlamydia Infections", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Infections", "Feasibility Studies", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Gonorrhea", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Prevalence", "Rectal Diseases", "Rectum", "Risk Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027001216", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and STI, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57191091520": {"Name": "Were J.", "AuthorID": "57191091520", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and STI, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57189584534": {"Name": "Duffell S.", "AuthorID": "57189584534", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and STI, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "55776817200": {"Name": "Mitchell H.", "AuthorID": "55776817200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57195554108": {"Name": "Silalang P.", "AuthorID": "57195554108", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Infection Reference Service, Microbiology Services Centre, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "56604787200": {"Name": "Childs T.", "AuthorID": "56604787200", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Infection Reference Service, Microbiology Services Centre, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7201639375": {"Name": "Jenkins C.", "AuthorID": "7201639375", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Infection Reference Service, Microbiology Services Centre, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57192482116": {"Name": "Patel H.", "AuthorID": "57192482116", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexually Transmitted Infection Reference Service, Microbiology Services Centre, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "8668568000": {"Name": "Alexander S.", "AuthorID": "8668568000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexually Transmitted Infection Reference Service, Microbiology Services Centre, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "35592025300": {"Name": "Ison C.", "AuthorID": "35592025300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexually Transmitted Infection Reference Service, Microbiology Services Centre, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "56035439700": {"Name": "Saxon C.", "AuthorID": "56035439700", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Medicine and HIV, University Hospitals of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
