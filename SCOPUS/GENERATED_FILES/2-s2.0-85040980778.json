The systems are based on laser-plasma EUV and SXR sources based on a double stream gas puff target. The EUV and SXR full field microscopes, operating at 13.8 nm and 2.88 nm wavelengths are capable of imaging nanostructures with a sub-50 nm spatial resolution and short (seconds) exposure times. The SXR contact microscope operates in the \"water-window\" spectral range and produces an imprint of the internal structure of the imaged sample in a thin layer of SXR sensitive photoresist. Applications of such desk-top EUV and SXR microscopes, mostly for biological samples (CT26 fibroblast cells and Keratinocytes) are also presented. Details about the sources, the microscopes as well as the imaging results for various objects will be presented and discussed. The development of such compact imaging systems may be important to the new research related to biological, material science and nanotechnology applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040980778", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"15045938800": {"Name": "Wachulak P.", "AuthorID": "15045938800", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "56519604100": {"Name": "Torrisi A.", "AuthorID": "56519604100", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "56816801100": {"Name": "Ayele M.", "AuthorID": "56816801100", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "7003336293": {"Name": "Bartnik A.", "AuthorID": "7003336293", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "8969992700": {"Name": "Czwartos J.", "AuthorID": "8969992700", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55579284700": {"Name": "W\u0229grzy\u0144ski \u0141.", "AuthorID": "55579284700", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55578939000": {"Name": "Fok T.", "AuthorID": "55578939000", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "7004495078": {"Name": "Fiedorowicz H.", "AuthorID": "7004495078", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}}}
