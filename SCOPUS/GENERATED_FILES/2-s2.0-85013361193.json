Yet landscape-scale evaluations of presence, abundance and distribution are difficult, as many species are wide-ranging, occur only at low densities and are elusive. Insufficient information-gathering tools for many large carnivore species compounds these challenges. Specially trained detection dogs have demonstrated effectiveness for carnivore surveys, but are untested on extremely sparse, wide-ranging species, such as cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. In this study, we conducted the first rigorous cheetah survey using detection dogs in a key transboundary area in the remote Liuwa\u2013Mussuma Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA) in Western Zambia. We proposed to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of detection dog versus spoor surveys in detecting cheetah presence; (2) extract and analyze DNA from scat samples to estimate minimum population size and genetic effective population size; (3) determine the extent of cheetah occurrence in the unprotected transboundary corridor. Two detection dog teams surveyed 2432 km2 containing 74 randomly located transects in the transfrontier area. Twenty-seven cheetah scats were detected and confirmed by genetic analysis, while no cheetah spoor was detected, clearly demonstrating the superiority of detection dogs in detecting cheetah presence. Combining scat samples with opportunistically collected samples, we estimated 17\u201319 cheetahs, an effective population size of 8\u201314 and a density of 5.9\u20136.6 per 1000 km2. Cheetah utilized key transfrontier areas outside of the national park; however, because utilization appears low, improved connectivity and protection for these areas are critical. Approximately one third of Africa's estimated cheetah resides in protected areas, with 87% in transboundary areas. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of detection dog survey methods in providing information on cheetah across large landscapes. It will have particular value in areas where other survey means may be impossible, such as TFCAs, where size, remoteness and lack of accessibility often make traditional survey methods difficult or cost prohibitive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acinonyx jubatus", "carnivores", "cheetah", "detection dogs", "Liuwa plain", "survey methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013361193", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"23472166300": {"Name": "Becker M.", "AuthorID": "23472166300", "AffiliationID": "60022522", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Biology and Ecology Program, Department of Ecology, Montana State University"}, "25640313700": {"Name": "Watson F.", "AuthorID": "25640313700", "AffiliationID": "60006683", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences, California State University Monterey Bay"}, "55787323900": {"Name": "M'soka J.", "AuthorID": "55787323900", "AffiliationID": "118786554", "AffiliationName": "Zambia Department of National Parks and Wildlife"}, "55499767100": {"Name": "Droge E.", "AuthorID": "55499767100", "AffiliationID": "60022522", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Biology and Ecology Program, Department of Ecology, Montana State University"}, "55275700300": {"Name": "Schuette P.", "AuthorID": "55275700300", "AffiliationID": "60029489", "AffiliationName": "Alaska Center for Conservation Science, University of Alaska Anchorage"}, "57193393832": {"Name": "Dunkley S.", "AuthorID": "57193393832", "AffiliationID": "112791893", "AffiliationName": "Zambian Carnivore Programme"}, "7003589897": {"Name": "Durant S.", "AuthorID": "7003589897", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo"}, "6602791520": {"Name": "Gottelli D.", "AuthorID": "6602791520", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7403673178": {"Name": "Parker M.", "AuthorID": "7403673178", "AffiliationID": "101143189", "AffiliationName": "Working Dogs for Conservation"}, "56304619900": {"Name": "Nyirenda M.", "AuthorID": "56304619900", "AffiliationID": "114557184", "AffiliationName": "World Wide Fund for Nature, Zambia Country Office"}, "54416882700": {"Name": "Brummer R.", "AuthorID": "54416882700", "AffiliationID": "118786446", "AffiliationName": "Green Dogs"}}}
