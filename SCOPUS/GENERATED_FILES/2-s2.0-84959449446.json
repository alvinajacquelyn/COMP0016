Here we have studied the photo-activated dehydrogenation of ethanol on reduced and oxidized rutile TiO2 (110) in ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Utilizing scanning tunnelling microscopy, various spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations we found that the photo-reaction proceeds most efficiently when the reactants are adsorbed on regular Ti surface sites, whereas species that are strongly adsorbed at surface defects such as O vacancies and step edges show little reaction under reducing conditions. We propose that regular Ti surface sites are the most active sites in photo-reactions on TiO2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959449446", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24450706200": {"Name": "Hansen J.", "AuthorID": "24450706200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "57148189100": {"Name": "Bebensee R.", "AuthorID": "57148189100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "22735081200": {"Name": "Martinez U.", "AuthorID": "22735081200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "35178313100": {"Name": "Porsgaard S.", "AuthorID": "35178313100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "24450703400": {"Name": "Lira E.", "AuthorID": "24450703400", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "25923643800": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "25923643800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "6603378704": {"Name": "Lammich L.", "AuthorID": "6603378704", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "7409074297": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "7409074297", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "7006430962": {"Name": "Besenbacher F.", "AuthorID": "7006430962", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "7102852290": {"Name": "Hammer B.", "AuthorID": "7102852290", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "7004375895": {"Name": "Wendt S.", "AuthorID": "7004375895", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for Storage Ring Facilities (ISA), Aarhus University"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC-Centre for Research and Development (CRD) at KAUST"}}}
