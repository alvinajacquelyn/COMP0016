The chemical reaction is coupled with the flow field naturally and the external force is also incorporated. An efficient discrete velocity model which has sixteen discrete velocities (and kinetic moments) is introduced into the DBM. With both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects under consideration, the DBM provides more detailed and accurate information than traditional Navier\u2013Stokes equations. This method is suitable for fluid flows ranging from subsonic, to supersonic and hypersonic ranges. It is validated by various benchmarks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressible", "Discrete Boltzmann", "Lattice Boltzmann", "Nonequilibrium", "Reactive flows"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boltzmann", "Compressible", "Lattice boltzmann", "Non equilibrium", "Reactive flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042334981", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"35337043800": {"Name": "Lin C.", "AuthorID": "35337043800", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
