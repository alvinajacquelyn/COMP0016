All rights reserved.When originally published in 1967 and using archive material from official records in Ottawa, this book threw new light on the motives and actions of the intervening powers. Allied intervention took place in three main areas: Northern and Southern Russia as well as Siberia. Canada was the major Commonwealth contributor to the intervention in Siberia and a superfial account of the events and their political implications is contained in the official history of the Canadian Army in the First World War. This book discusses the subject in depth and from an international perspective. In this critical assessment the story of the Allied operations in Russia has been written against the double background of the issues and events of the Russian Civil War itself and of the international intrigues and rivalries of the Allies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068858121", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"6603685472": {"Name": "Swettenham J.", "AuthorID": "6603685472", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
