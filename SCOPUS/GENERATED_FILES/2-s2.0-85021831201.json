We performed a review of relevant articles retrieved from Pubmed \u00ae , Embase \u00ae and Scopus \u00ae and Google UK Inc. to investigate the commercial availability and issuance of these products. From 84 identified studies, we shortlisted 74 for review. The Google search retrieved 1,090,000 results within 0.57 s (January 2017). We explored 32 websites selling medical alert jewellery in the first five pages of these results. We found that patients themselves are currently responsible for the engraved wording on medical alert jewellery, with no mandatory physician checks. The accuracy and appropriateness of this information may thus vary. In the absence of national guidance in the UK, we suggest that there should be a list of specific indications warranting their use, a requirement for regular review of information, and clarity around the level of physician input into the engraving chosen. We discuss the potential benefits vs. risks of wearing medical alert jewellery and clarify the limitations of medical teams\u2019 responsibilities in relation to patients found to be wearing them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allergy", "anaphylaxis", "emergency health service", "medical alert", "medical jewellery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Emergency Medical Services", "Emergency Medical Tags", "Humans", "Jewelry", "Physicians", "Risk Assessment", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021831201", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"56623867600": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "56623867600", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}, "36734984300": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "36734984300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospitals"}, "57202730910": {"Name": "Sultan P.", "AuthorID": "57202730910", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospitals"}}}
