We used a full factorial experimental design (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3) to solve a routine query in every biomaterial research project: the optimisation of cell seeding efficiency for pre-clinical in vitro cell studies, the importance of which is often overlooked. In addition, tissue-engineered scaffolds can be cellularised with relevant cell type(s) to form implantable tissue constructs, where the cell seeding method must be reliable and robust. Our results show the complex relationship between cells and scaffolds and suggest that the optimum seeding conditions for each material may be different due to different material properties, and therefore, should be investigated for individual scaffolds. Our factorial experimental design can be easily translated to other cell types and three-dimensional biomaterials, where multiple interacting variables can be thoroughly investigated for better understanding of cell\u2013biomaterial interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomaterials", "cell seeding efficiency", "dermal fibroblasts", "dermal scaffolds", "Factorial design", "tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060666213", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57193754770": {"Name": "Levin A.", "AuthorID": "57193754770", "AffiliationID": "101109338", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute"}, "56390982500": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "56390982500", "AffiliationID": "101109338", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute"}, "55375422500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Gareta E.", "AuthorID": "55375422500", "AffiliationID": "101109338", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute"}, "57206156756": {"Name": "Hook L.", "AuthorID": "57206156756", "AffiliationID": "122037343", "AffiliationName": "Smart Matrix Ltd"}}}
