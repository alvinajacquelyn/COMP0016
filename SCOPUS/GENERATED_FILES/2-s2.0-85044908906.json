It draws on the work of educational theorists Gert Biesta and Michael Young in order to extend and expand upon the dominant, dichotomizing discourse of \u201chistorical versus non-historical\u201d approaches within which much existing Holocaust education literature has previously been framed. Following Young, the article asks: What forms of knowledge of the Holocaust are most \u201cpowerful\u201d in terms of facilitating student understanding? And further: Which teaching aims are best suited to ensuring all students have access to these?.", "AuthorKeywords": ["curriculum", "Holocaust", "powerful knowledge", "secondary education", "student understanding", "teaching aims"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044908906", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55352580200": {"Name": "Pettigrew A.", "AuthorID": "55352580200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, University College London"}}}
