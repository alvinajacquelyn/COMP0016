We conducted an ethnic-based meta-analysis of the association of LOXL1 polymorphisms with PEX/pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEXG). Association studies were retrieved systematically from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge. Allelic and genotype frequencies of rs3825942, rs1048661, and rs2165241 were compared between PEX/PEXG and controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. Overall, 39 independent cohorts were included. Rs3825942 (G) was an at risk allele for PEX/PEXG in Caucasians, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, South Asians, and Middle Easterners, but protective in Black South Africans (OR = 0.10, 95%CI:0.06-0.16). Rs1048661 (G) was an at risk allele for PEX/PEXG in Caucasians, South Asians, Middle Easterners and Black South Africans, but was protective in Japanese (OR = 0.03, 95%CI:0.02-0.06) and Koreans (OR = 0.10, 95%CI:0.05-0.22). These associations we-re confirmed for the genotypic recessive models. Rs2165241 (C) was a protective allele for PEX/PEXG in Caucasians, but was an at risk allele in Japanese (OR = 7.49, 95%CI:3.22-17.41) and Koreans (OR = 6.63, 95%CI:2.60-16.90). This was confirmed for the genotypic dominant model. Other genetic and/or environmental factors may modify the effect of LOXL1 polymorphisms in certain ethnic groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exfoliation", "Genetic polymorphisms", "Glaucoma", "LOXL1", "Pseudoexfoliation syndrome", "Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Alleles", "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Confidence Intervals", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Exfoliation Syndrome", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Odds Ratio", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944209025", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"23469171600": {"Name": "Founti P.", "AuthorID": "23469171600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "51764369800": {"Name": "Salonikiou A.", "AuthorID": "51764369800", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "8873282000": {"Name": "Anastasopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "8873282000", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "8873281900": {"Name": "Pappas T.", "AuthorID": "8873281900", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57194262710": {"Name": "Topouzis F.", "AuthorID": "57194262710", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6603299696": {"Name": "Haidich A.B.", "AuthorID": "6603299696", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "8906520900": {"Name": "Chatzikyriakidou A.", "AuthorID": "8906520900", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Genetics, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "35508042400": {"Name": "Lambropoulos A.", "AuthorID": "35508042400", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Genetics, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "56896867300": {"Name": "Viswanathan A.C.", "AuthorID": "56896867300", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
