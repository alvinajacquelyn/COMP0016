In vitro studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) protect AML blasts from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Here, we report a novel interaction between AML blasts and BM-MSCs, which benefits AML proliferation and survival. We initially examined the cytokine profile in cultured human AML compared with AML cultured with BM-MSCs and found that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was highly expressed by primary AML, and that IL8 was increased in AML/BM-MSC cocultures. Recombinant MIF increased IL8 expression in BM-MSCs via its receptor CD74. Moreover, the MIF inhibitor ISO-1 inhibited AML-induced IL8 expression by BM-MSCs as well as BM-MSC-induced AML survival. Protein kinase C \u03b2 (PKC\u03b2) regulated MIF-induced IL8 in BM-MSCs. Finally, targeted IL8 shRNA inhibited BM-MSC-induced AML survival. These results describe a novel, bidirectional, prosurvival mechanism between AML blasts and BM-MSCs. Furthermore, they provide biologic rationale for therapeutic strategies in AML targeting the microenvironment, specifically MIF and IL8.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blotting, Western", "Cell Survival", "Coculture Techniques", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Interleukin-8", "Intramolecular Oxidoreductases", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Protein Kinase C beta", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018198727", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55347032300": {"Name": "Abdul-Aziz A.M.", "AuthorID": "55347032300", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57188955154": {"Name": "Shafat M.S.", "AuthorID": "57188955154", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "8960406000": {"Name": "Rushworth S.A.", "AuthorID": "8960406000", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "35791768400": {"Name": "Bowles K.M.", "AuthorID": "35791768400", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57194085464": {"Name": "Mehta T.K.", "AuthorID": "57194085464", "AffiliationID": "60105122", "AffiliationName": "Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC)"}, "6602161968": {"Name": "Di Palma F.", "AuthorID": "6602161968", "AffiliationID": "60105122", "AffiliationName": "Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC)"}, "36573818700": {"Name": "Lawes M.J.", "AuthorID": "36573818700", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
