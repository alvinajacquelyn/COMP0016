In this report, we utilize single-cell force spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of the initial interaction between living Staphylococcus aureus cells and machined titanium surfaces at the nanoscale. Values for maximum adhesion force were found to increase from 0-s (-0.27 \u00b1 0.30 nN) to 60-s (-9.15 \u00b1 0.78 nN) surface delays, with similar results observed for total adhesion work (7.39 \u00b1 2.38 and 988.06 \u00b1 117.08 aJ, respectively). Single unbinding events observed at higher surface delays were modeled according to the wormlike chain model, obtaining molecular contour-length predictions of 314.06 \u00b1 9.27 nm. Average single-bond rupture forces of -0.95 \u00b1 0.04 nN were observed at increased contact times. Short- and long-range force components of bacterial adhesion were obtained by Poisson analysis of single unbinding event peaks, yielding values of -0.75 \u00b1 0.04 and -0.58 \u00b1 0.15 nN, respectively. Addition of 2-mg/mL chlorhexidine to the buffer solution resulted in the inhibition of specific adhesive events but an increased overall adhesion force and work. These results suggest that initial attachment of S. aureus to smooth titanium is mostly mediated by short-range attractive forces observed at higher surface delays.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atomic force microscopy", "bacterial adhesion", "biophysics", "dental implants", "microbiology", "nanomechanics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Adhesion", "Cell Survival", "Dental Implants", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Microspheres", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Surface Properties", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937865822", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56492783200": {"Name": "Aguayo S.", "AuthorID": "56492783200", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "6602787947": {"Name": "Bozec L.", "AuthorID": "6602787947", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004394482": {"Name": "Spratt D.", "AuthorID": "7004394482", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
