Given a Bernoulli shift, we show that any other Bernoulli shift that is of strictly less entropy and is stochastically dominated by the original measure can be obtained as a monotone factor; that is, the factor map has the property that for each point in the domain, its image under the factor map is coordinatewise smaller than or equal to the original point.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burton-rothstein", "Monotone coupling", "Sinai factor theorem", "Stochastic domination"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958182734", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"57203014940": {"Name": "Quas A.", "AuthorID": "57203014940", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department Of Mathematics And Statistics, University Of Victoria"}, "57208814425": {"Name": "Soo T.", "AuthorID": "57208814425", "AffiliationID": "60015457", "AffiliationName": "Department Of Mathematics, University Of Kansas"}}}
