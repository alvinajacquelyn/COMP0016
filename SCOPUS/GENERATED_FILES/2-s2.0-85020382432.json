To demonstrate this, polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer and iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were used as the fibrous composite matrix. Fiber pore size increased with increasing immersed secondary solvent temperature. By contouring the surface morphology (via modulation of secondary collection solvents) of hollow magnetic fibers, drug (ketoconazole) release kinetics from spun mats were tuned. Furthermore, applying an external AC magnetic field to NP embedded porous fibers enhanced drug release. These findings are promising for alternative engineering, tuning and controlling fiber morphology and drug release behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coaxial", "Electrospinning", "Enhanced drug release", "Polymers", "Porous fiber", "Surface morphology"], "IndexKeywords": ["AC magnetic fields", "Coaxial", "Drug release", "Electrospinning method", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Porous fibers", "Solvent temperatures", "Variable temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020382432", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57194492494": {"Name": "Wu S.", "AuthorID": "57194492494", "AffiliationID": "60117854, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology and Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Zhejiang University"}, "57189620423": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "57189620423", "AffiliationID": "60117854, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology and Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Zhejiang University"}, "35387659500": {"Name": "Chang M.W.", "AuthorID": "35387659500", "AffiliationID": "60117854, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology and Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Zhejiang University"}, "57216662142": {"Name": "Li J.S.", "AuthorID": "57216662142", "AffiliationID": "60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering of Education Ministry of China"}, "55418069300": {"Name": "Ahmad Z.", "AuthorID": "55418069300", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "Leicester School of Pharmacy, De Montfort University"}, "35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
