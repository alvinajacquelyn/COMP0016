A population-based OC genetic risk prediction and stratification program is being developed. A previous focus group study with individuals from the general population showed support for the proposed program. This qualitative interview study explores the attitudes of women at high risk of OC. Eight women participated in one-on-one, in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore: experiences of learning of OC risk, risk perceptions, OC knowledge and awareness, and opinions on risk stratification approach. There was evidence of strong support for the proposed program. Benefits were seen as providing reassurance to women at low risk, and reducing worry in women at high risk through appropriate clinical management. Stratification into \u2018low\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 risk groups was well-received. Participants were more hesitant about stratification to the \u2018intermediate\u2019 risk group. The data suggest formats to effectively communicate OC risk estimates will require careful thought. Interactions with GPs were highlighted as a barrier to OC risk assessment and diagnosis. These results are encouraging for the possible introduction and uptake of a risk prediction and stratification program for OC in the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRCA1/2", "Genetic testing", "High risk", "Ovarian cancer", "Risk prediction", "Risk stratification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Middle Aged", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Qualitative Research", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941735383", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55320413400": {"Name": "Rahman B.", "AuthorID": "55320413400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7102793051": {"Name": "Fraser L.", "AuthorID": "7102793051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57218348853": {"Name": "Side L.", "AuthorID": "57218348853", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "24480998900": {"Name": "Gessler S.", "AuthorID": "24480998900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "51565577500": {"Name": "Meisel S.F.", "AuthorID": "51565577500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}}}
