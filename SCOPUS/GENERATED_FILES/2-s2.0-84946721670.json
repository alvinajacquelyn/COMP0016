We have determined the capacity of ECg to alter the course of infection in zebrafish embryos challenged with epidemic clinical isolate EMRSA-16. At 30 h post fertilization (hpf), embryos were infected by injection of 1-5 \u00d7 103 colony forming units (CFU) of EMRSA-16 into the circulation valley or yolk sac. Infection by yolk sac injection was lethal with a challenge dose above 3 \u00d7 103 CFU, with no survivors at 70 hpf. In contrast, survival at 70 hpf after injection into the circulation was 83 and 44% following challenge with 3 \u00d7 103 and 1-5 \u00d7 103 CFU, respectively. No significant increases in survival were noted when infected embryos were maintained in medium containing 12.5-100 \u03bcg/mL ECg with or without 4 or 16 \u03bcg/mL oxacillin. However, when EMRSA-16 was grown in medium containing 12.5 \u03bcg/mL ECg and the bacteria used to infect embryos by either the circulation valley or yolk sac, there were significant increases in embryo survival in both the presence and absence of oxacillin. ECg-modified and unmodified, GFP-transformed EMRSA-16 bacteria were visualized within phagocytic cells in the circulation and yolk sac; pre-treatment with ECg also significantly increased induction of the respiratory burst and suppressed increases in IL-1\u03b2 expression typical of infection with untreated EMRSA-16. We conclude that exposure to ECg prior to infection reduces the lethality of EMRSA-16, renders cells more susceptible to elimination by immune processes and compromises their capacity to establish an inflammatory response in comparison to non-exposed bacteria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial activity", "Epicatechin gallate", "MRSA", "Respiratory burst", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Tea catechins", "Zebrafish embryo infection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946721670", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"56954227000": {"Name": "Stevens C.", "AuthorID": "56954227000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "23986169000": {"Name": "Rosado H.", "AuthorID": "23986169000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7404775765": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "7404775765", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
