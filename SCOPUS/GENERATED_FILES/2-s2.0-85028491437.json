All rights reserved.Research on speech production investigates the cognitive processes involved in transforming thoughts into speech. This article starts with a discussion of the methodological issues inherent to research in speech production that illustrates how empirical approaches to speech production must differ from related fields like language comprehension. Then, an overview of the processing stages engaged in production as generally agreed upon by the different theories in the field is presented. The processing stages are: conceptual preparation - turning a thought into a verbalizable message to be expressed; grammatical encoding - developing a syntactic frame for the to-be-uttered sentence; and phonological encoding - realizing the phonological content of the syntactic frame. For each processing stage, basic theoretical assumptions, representative findings, and open issues are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive processes", "Conceptual preparation", "Grammatical encoding", "Language comprehension", "Phonological encoding", "Speech errors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028491437", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7005461750": {"Name": "Schriefers H.", "AuthorID": "7005461750", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Nijmegen University"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60024516", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics"}}}
