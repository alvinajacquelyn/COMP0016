First, the journal selection procedure allows to discern between high-quality journals and more popular business magazines. Second, the collected papers on project control and EVM, published in the selected journals, are classified based on a framework consisting of six distinct classes. Third, the classification framework indicates current trends and potential areas for future research, which can be summarized as follows: (i) increased attention to the stochastic nature of projects, (ii) enhanced validation of the proposed methodology using a large historical dataset or a simulation experiment, (iii) expansion of integrated control models, focusing on time and cost as well as other factors such as quality and sustainability, and (iv) development and validation of corrective action procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Earned value management", "Project control", "Project management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Business magazines", "Classification framework", "Corrective actions", "Earned value management", "Historical dataset", "Project control", "Selection procedures", "Stochastic nature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940435378", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"56719286100": {"Name": "Willems L.", "AuthorID": "56719286100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University"}, "6602303040": {"Name": "Vanhoucke M.", "AuthorID": "6602303040", "AffiliationID": "60027406", "AffiliationName": "Vlerick Business School"}}}
