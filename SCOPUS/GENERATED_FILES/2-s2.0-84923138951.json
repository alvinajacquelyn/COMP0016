It is hypothesised that genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may exert protective or deleterious effects on penetrance of AOPTD. By examining environmental exposure history in cervical dystonia patients and their similarly aged unaffected siblings we aimed to determine the role of previous environmental exposures in relation to disease penetrance. Methods: A case-control study of 67 patients with cervical dystonia and 67 of their age-matched unaffected siblings was performed. Past environmental exposures were assessed using a detailed 124-question standardised questionnaire. Results: By univariate analysis, cervical dystonia patients, compared to their unaffected siblings, had an increased frequency of a history of car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 10.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 47.4, p=0.004) and surgical episodes (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.76 to 23.61, p=0.005). Following multivariate analysis, car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 37.6, p=0.017) and all surgical episodes (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.24 to 19.31, p=0.023) remained significantly associated with case status. Conclusions: Cervical dystonia patients had a history, prior to symptom onset, of significantly more frequent episodes of surgery and of car accidents with hospital attendance than their age-matched unaffected siblings. Soft tissue trauma appears to increase risk of development of cervical dystonia in genetically predetermined individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromosome Aberrations", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Heterozygote Detection", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Penetrance", "Questionnaires", "Risk Factors", "Torticollis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923138951", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37114824200": {"Name": "Molloy A.", "AuthorID": "37114824200", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "39061419100": {"Name": "Kimmich O.", "AuthorID": "39061419100", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "56799634400": {"Name": "Williams L.", "AuthorID": "56799634400", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "56522684600": {"Name": "Byrne N.", "AuthorID": "56522684600", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "55893470600": {"Name": "O'Riordan S.", "AuthorID": "55893470600", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "7201506609": {"Name": "Hutchinson M.", "AuthorID": "7201506609", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "6603872219": {"Name": "Molloy F.", "AuthorID": "6603872219", "AffiliationID": "60000718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysiology, Beaumont Hospital"}, "55737422800": {"Name": "Moore H.", "AuthorID": "55737422800", "AffiliationID": "60010410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Cork University Hospital"}, "7202291367": {"Name": "Healy D.", "AuthorID": "7202291367", "AffiliationID": "60000718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Beaumont Hospital"}, "7203058121": {"Name": "Lynch T.", "AuthorID": "7203058121", "AffiliationID": "60019449", "AffiliationName": "Dublin Neurological Institute, Mater Misericordiae Hospital"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "7401952529": {"Name": "Walsh C.", "AuthorID": "7401952529", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Trinity College Dublin"}, "35110895000": {"Name": "Butler J.", "AuthorID": "35110895000", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Centre for Bioengineering, Trinity College Dublin"}, "7102935766": {"Name": "Reilly R.", "AuthorID": "7102935766", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Centre for Bioengineering, Trinity College Dublin"}}}
