Despite numerous publications on pharmacokinetic drug\u2013drug interactions (DDIs) between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such data are not used to support the dose rationale for polytherapy in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Here we assess the impact of DDIs on plasma concentrations and evaluate the need for AED dose adjustment. Methods: Models describing the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, valproic acid and zonisamide in adult and paediatric patients were collected from the published literature and implemented in NONMEM v7.2. Taking current clinical practice into account, we explore simulation scenarios to characterize AED exposure in virtual patients receiving mono- and polytherapy. Steady-state, maximum and minimum concentrations were selected as parameters of interest for this analysis. Results: Our simulations show that DDIs can cause major changes in AED concentrations both in adults and children. When more than one AED is used, even larger changes are observed in the concentrations of the primary drug, leading to significant differences in steady-state concentration between mono- and polytherapy for most AEDs. These results suggest that currently recommended dosing algorithms and titration procedures do not ensure attainment of appropriate therapeutic concentrations. Conclusions: The effect of DDIs on AED exposure cannot be overlooked. Clinical guidelines must consider such covariate effects and ensure appropriate dosing recommendations for adult and paediatric patients who require combination therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug\u2013drug interactions", "epilepsy", "modelling and simulations", "personalized medicine", "pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticonvulsants", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Computer Simulation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Interactions", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038425699", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"36054330400": {"Name": "van Dijkman S.", "AuthorID": "36054330400", "AffiliationID": "113971800", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research"}, "57199863022": {"Name": "Rauw\u00e9 W.", "AuthorID": "57199863022", "AffiliationID": "113971800", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research"}, "7101741871": {"Name": "Danhof M.", "AuthorID": "7101741871", "AffiliationID": "113971800", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics Group, University College London"}}}
