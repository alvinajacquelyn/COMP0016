Therefore, to constrain the rate of CPO development in post-perovskite, we deformed CaIrO3, a low-pressure analogue of MgSiO3 post-perovskite, in simple shear at 3.2 GPa and 400 \u00b0C to a shear strain (\u03b3) of 0.81. From X-ray diffraction patterns acquired during deformation, we invert for CPO as a function of strain. By comparing the CPO that develops with visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) models we constrain the critical resolved shear stresses (CRSS) of the non-primary slip-systems in CaIrO3 to be of order 6 times stronger than the primary [100](010) slip system. This value is significantly less than has been assumed by previous studies and if applicable to MgSiO3 implies that seismic anisotropy in the D\u2033 layer develops slower than has previously been assumed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["D\u2033 layer", "Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD)", "Inverse pole figure", "Lattice preferred orientation (LPO)", "Orientation distribution function (ODF)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical resolved shear stress", "Crystallographic preferred orientations", "Electron back scatter diffraction", "High strain deformation", "Inverse pole figures", "Lattice preferred orientation", "Orientation distribution function", "Visco-plastic self-consistent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973102566", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"24461613100": {"Name": "Hunt S.", "AuthorID": "24461613100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56962719700": {"Name": "Walker A.", "AuthorID": "56962719700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "8214633000": {"Name": "Mariani E.", "AuthorID": "8214633000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Sciences, Jane Herdman Laboratories, University of Liverpool"}}}
