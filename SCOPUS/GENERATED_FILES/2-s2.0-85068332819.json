Despite some progress in the field, there is still a need for tools that have low thresholds in terms of the users\u2019 technical expertise. Here, we demonstrate that designing systems with lower entry barrier can potentially be achieved through co-design activities with non-programmers and carefully observing novices. Following an iterative participatory co-design cycle with teachers who have little or no programming expertise, we reflect on their proposed enhancements. Our investigations focus on Authelo, an authoring tool that has been designed primarily for Exploratory Learning Objects, but we conclude the paper by providing transferable lessons, particularly the strong preference for visual interfaces and high-level pedagogical predicates for authoring analysis and feedback rules.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Authoring tools", "Intelligent systems", "Participatory design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Authoring tool", "Designing systems", "Exploratory learning", "Intelligent support", "Participatory design", "Pedagogical strategies", "Technical expertise", "Visual Interface"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068332819", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "56333544000": {"Name": "Karkalas S.", "AuthorID": "56333544000", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "56904209900": {"Name": "Cukurova M.", "AuthorID": "56904209900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "57209642275": {"Name": "Papapesiou E.", "AuthorID": "57209642275", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}}}
