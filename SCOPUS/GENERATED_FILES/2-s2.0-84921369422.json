We present a formalism for computing the virial coefficients that employs a diagrammatic approach to the grand potential and allows one to easily include an effective range R\u2217 in the interaction. In the limit where the thermal wavelength \u03bbR\u2217, the calculation of the virial coefficients is perturbative even at unitarity and the system resembles a weakly interacting Bose-Fermi mixture for all scattering lengths a. By interpolating from the perturbative limits \u03bb/|a|1 and R\u2217/\u03bb1, we estimate the value of the fourth virial coefficient at unitarity for R\u2217=0 and we find that it is close to the value obtained in recent experiments. We also derive the equations of state for the pressure, density, and entropy, as well as the spectral function at high temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bose-Fermi mixtures", "Perturbative limit", "Scattering length", "Short-range attraction", "Spectral function", "Thermal wave length", "Virial coefficient", "Virial expansion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921369422", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55247304000": {"Name": "Ngampruetikorn V.", "AuthorID": "55247304000", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "T.C.M.
