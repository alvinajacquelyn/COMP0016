Herein, we measure the yield and kinetics of hole transfer across the methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite|polymeric hole transport material heterojunction, as a function of the interfacial energy offset, \u03b4E, between the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport material and the valence band edge of the perovskite. A combination of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, along with transient absorption spectroscopy, revealed that only a small driving energy (\u03b4E \u223c0.07 eV) is required to induce highly efficient hole transfer. The findings of this paper suggest that further improvements in the open-circuit voltage, and so the power conversion efficiency, of perovskite solar cells could be achieved by incorporating hole transport materials that provide an interfacial energy offset in the range 0 < \u03b4E < 0.18 eV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Control and optimization", "Highest occupied molecular orbital", "Hole transport materials", "Interfacial charge transfer", "Organic hole conductors", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Time-resolved photoluminescence", "Transient absorption spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041440849", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57200511189": {"Name": "Westbrook R.", "AuthorID": "57200511189", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200511387": {"Name": "Sanchez-Molina D.", "AuthorID": "57200511387", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "57200514247": {"Name": "Manuel Marin-Beloqui D.", "AuthorID": "57200514247", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "55382763400": {"Name": "Haque D.", "AuthorID": "55382763400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein D.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
