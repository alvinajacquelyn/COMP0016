Previous studies have associated visual vertigo with an increased prevalence of underlying white matter lesions on brain imaging. Method: This study evaluated the magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain from a cohort of patients with visual vertigo, and compared the outcomes to an age- and gender-matched group of healthy volunteers. Results: and conclusion White matter lesions were observed in 17.9 per cent of the patient group and in 16.3 per cent of the control group. The prevalence of white matter lesions in the patient group was not too different to that expected based on age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dizziness", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Vertigo", "White Matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Leukoencephalopathies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Meniere Disease", "Middle Aged", "Migraine Disorders", "Prevalence", "Severity of Illness Index", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vertigo", "Vestibular Neuronitis", "Visual Perception", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050266171", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"36499143600": {"Name": "Dimitriadis P.A.", "AuthorID": "36499143600", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, University of Sheffield"}, "57203017985": {"Name": "Saad M.", "AuthorID": "57203017985", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, University of Sheffield"}, "57201981225": {"Name": "Ray J.", "AuthorID": "57201981225", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, University of Sheffield"}, "57191637014": {"Name": "Igra M.S.", "AuthorID": "57191637014", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Radiology, University of Sheffield"}, "35320114100": {"Name": "Hoggard N.", "AuthorID": "35320114100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Radiology, University of Sheffield"}, "55675790000": {"Name": "Mandavia R.", "AuthorID": "55675790000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, University College London Hospitals"}, "57194766313": {"Name": "Bowes C.", "AuthorID": "57194766313", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hearing Services, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, University of Sheffield"}}}
