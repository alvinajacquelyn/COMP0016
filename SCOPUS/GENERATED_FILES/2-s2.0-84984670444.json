The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We investigate whether flux cancellation is responsible for the formation of a very massive filament resulting in the spectacular eruption on 2011 June 7. We analyze and quantify the amount of flux cancellation that occurs in NOAA AR 11226 and its two neighboring active regions (ARs 11227 & 11233) using line-of-sight magnetograms from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager. During a 3.6 day period building up to the eruption of the filament, 1.7 \u00d71021 Mx, 21% of AR 11226's maximum magnetic flux, was canceled along the polarity inversion line (PIL) where the filament formed. If the flux cancellation continued at the same rate up until the eruption then up to 2.8 \u00d71021 Mx (34% of the AR flux) may have been built into the magnetic configuration that contains the filament plasma. The large flux cancellation rate is due to an unusual motion of the positive-polarity sunspot, which splits, with the largest section moving rapidly toward the PIL. This motion compresses the negative polarity and leads to the formation of an orphan penumbra where one end of the filament is rooted. Dense plasma threads above the orphan penumbra build into the filament, extending its length, and presumably injecting material into it. We conclude that the exceptionally strong flux cancellation in AR 11226 played a significant role in the formation of its unusually massive filament. In addition, the presence and coherent evolution of bald patches in the vector magnetic field along the PIL suggest that the magnetic field configuration supporting the filament material is that of a flux rope.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Sun: activity", "Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)", "Sun: evolution", "Sun: filaments, prominences", "Sun: magnetic fields", "Sun: photosphere"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984670444", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56584197500": {"Name": "Yardley S.L.", "AuthorID": "56584197500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "7401917508": {"Name": "Green L.M.", "AuthorID": "7401917508", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "57213469053": {"Name": "Williams D.R.", "AuthorID": "57213469053", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "7005109977": {"Name": "Van Driel-Gesztelyi L.", "AuthorID": "7005109977", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60004114", "AffiliationName": "Konkoly Observatory, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "22954929800": {"Name": "Valori G.", "AuthorID": "22954929800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "57190952626": {"Name": "Dacie S.", "AuthorID": "57190952626", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}}}
