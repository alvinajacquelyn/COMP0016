With the introduction of phase compensation, the circuit is able to operate at frequencies higher than the pole frequency of the output transconductor with minimum phase delay. Moreover, it isolates the poles required for stability from the high frequency characteristics of the output transconductor. The circuit has been simulated in a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS technology and operates from \u00b12.5 V power supplies. Simulations show that for a 1 mAp-p output current, the phase delay is less than 1\u00b0 for frequencies up to 3 MHz, rising to 1.5\u00b0 at 5 MHz. Dual frequency currents to the load are demonstrated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bioimpedance measurement", "CMOS technology", "Current drivers", "High frequency characteristics", "Output current", "Phase compensation", "Pole frequency", "Transconductors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983429282", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"38961723700": {"Name": "Neshatvar N.", "AuthorID": "38961723700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36936417600": {"Name": "Langlois P.", "AuthorID": "36936417600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
