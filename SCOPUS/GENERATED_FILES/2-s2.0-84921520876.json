The study population consists of loan applicants who were marginally rejected by an MFI in Bosnia. A random subset of these were offered a loan. We provide evidence of higher self-employment, increases in inventory, a reduction in the incidence of wage work and an increase in the labor supply of 16-19-year-olds in the household's business. We also present some evidence of increases in profits and a reduction in consumption and savings. There is no evidence that the program increased overall household income.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921520876", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"36102390000": {"Name": "Augsburg B.", "AuthorID": "36102390000", "AffiliationID": "60012327", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "14008324000": {"Name": "De Haas R.", "AuthorID": "14008324000", "AffiliationID": "60017145", "AffiliationName": "Tilburg University"}, "6507793844": {"Name": "Harmgart H.", "AuthorID": "6507793844", "AffiliationID": "114911733", "AffiliationName": "EBRD"}, "6601965693": {"Name": "Meghir C.", "AuthorID": "6601965693", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Yale University"}}}
