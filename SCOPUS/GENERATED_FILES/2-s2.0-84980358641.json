This work presents a line list of 1.3 billion 32S16O2 vibration-rotation transitions computed using an empirically adjusted potential energy surface and an ab initio dipole moment surface. The list gives complete coverage up to 8000 cm-1 (wavelengths longer than 1.25 \u03bcm) for temperatures below 2000 K. Infrared absorption cross-sections are recorded at 300 and 500 C are used to validated the resulting ExoAmes line list. The line list is made available in electronic form as supplementary data to this article and at www.exomol.com.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "Molecular data", "Opacity", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980358641", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55812434100": {"Name": "Underwood D.S.", "AuthorID": "55812434100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7410246141": {"Name": "Huang X.", "AuthorID": "7410246141", "AffiliationID": "60007478", "AffiliationName": "SETI Institute"}, "7005870114": {"Name": "Schwenke D.W.", "AuthorID": "7005870114", "AffiliationID": "60004179", "AffiliationName": "NASA Ames Research Center, NAS Facility"}, "55902054800": {"Name": "Lee T.J.", "AuthorID": "55902054800", "AffiliationID": "60004179", "AffiliationName": "NASA Ames Research Center, Space Science and Astrobiology Division"}, "7006728329": {"Name": "Clausen S.", "AuthorID": "7006728329", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57197593770": {"Name": "Fateev A.", "AuthorID": "57197593770", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark"}}}
