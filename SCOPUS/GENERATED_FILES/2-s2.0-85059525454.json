Materials and methods: OCT and OCTA images were collected from 116 POAG eyes and 40 normal eyes in a prospective, cross-sectional observational study. Glaucomatous eyes were further divided into three groups according to a Glaucoma Staging System. Measurements of macular vessel density, ganglion cell complex (GCC), and disk retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were compared among groups. Results: The macular vessel density, GCC, and RNFL are significantly reduced in POAG compared to normal eyes that also corresponds to the severity of glaucoma (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with Dunnett\u2019s correction; p < 0.0001). Visual field mean deviation correlates significantly with macular vessel density (p = 0.0028, r = 0.3), GCC (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6), and RNFL (p = 0.008, r = 0.36) in POAG. There are significant correlations between GCC and RNFL (p < 0.0001, r = 0.76) as well as macular vessel density (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48). Increased age also correlates with reduced macular vessel density in both normal (p = 0.0002, r = 0.49) and glaucomatous eyes (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48), but a greater proportionate reduction of vessel density is seen in glaucomatous eyes. Conclusion: Reduced macular vessel density occurs in POAG despite of age-related changes, which also correlates with reductions in RNFL and GCC measurements. OCTA can detect microstructural defects and offers potential to facilitate diagnosis of glaucoma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["field of vision", "Glaucoma", "intraocular pressure", "macula", "OCTA", "optic nerve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Capillaries", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Disk", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Retinal Vessels", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059525454", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56168731000": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "56168731000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "55520733700": {"Name": "Chu C.J.", "AuthorID": "55520733700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57199084217": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "57199084217", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "55404318100": {"Name": "Sebastian R.T.", "AuthorID": "55404318100", "AffiliationID": "60016719", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Eye Hospital"}, "55909002900": {"Name": "McGregor F.", "AuthorID": "55909002900", "AffiliationID": "60016719", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Eye Hospital"}}}
