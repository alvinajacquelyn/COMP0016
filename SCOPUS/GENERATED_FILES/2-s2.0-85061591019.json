Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Carbohydrates are the major component of biomass and have unique potential as a sustainable source of building blocks for chemicals, materials, and biofuels because of their low cost, ready availability, and stereochemical diversity. With a view to upgrading carbohydrates to access valuable nitrogen-containing sugar-like compounds such as aminopolyols, biocatalytic aminations using transaminase enzymes (TAms) have been investigated as a sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic strategies. Demonstrated here is the reaction of TAms with sugar-derived tetrahydrofuran (THF) aldehydes, obtained from the regioselective dehydration of biomass-derived sugars, to provide access to cyclic aminodiols in high yields. In a preliminary study we have also established the direct transamination of sugars to give acyclic aminopolyols. Notably, the reaction of the ketose d-fructose proceeds with complete stereoselectivity to yield valuable aminosugars in high purity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aminopolyols", "biocatalysis", "biomass", "carbohydrates", "enzymes"], "IndexKeywords": ["aminopolyols", "Biocatalysis", "Building blockes", "D-fructose", "High purity", "Regio-selective", "Synthetic strategies", "Tetrahydrofurans", "Amination", "Biocatalysis", "Biofuels", "Biomass", "Carbohydrates", "Colorimetry", "Furans", "Monosaccharides", "Stereoisomerism", "Sugars", "Transaminases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061591019", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"24470204700": {"Name": "Subrizi F.", "AuthorID": "24470204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35321053300": {"Name": "Benhamou L.", "AuthorID": "35321053300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.D.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
