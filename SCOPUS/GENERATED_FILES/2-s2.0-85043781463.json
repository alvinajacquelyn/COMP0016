{"Title": "The longitudinal trajectory of default mode network connectivity in healthy older adults varies as a function of age and is associated with changes in episodic memory and processing speed", "Year": 2018, "Source": "J. Neurosci.", "Volume": "38", "Issue": 11, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2809, "PageEnd": 2817, "CitedBy": 49, "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3067-17.2018", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043781463&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 the authors.The default mode network (DMN) supports memory functioning and may be sensitive to preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Little is known, however, about the longitudinal trajectory of this network\u2019s intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). In this study, we evaluated longitudinal FC in 111 cognitively normal older human adults (ages 49\u201387, 46 women/65 men), 92 of whom had at least three task-free fMRI scans (n = 353 total scans). Whole-brain FC and three DMN subnetworks were assessed: (1) within-DMN, (2) between anterior and posterior DMN, and (3) between medial temporal lobe network and posterior DMN. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated significant baseline age \u2613 time interactions, indicating a nonlinear trajectory. There was a trend toward increasing FC between ages 50\u201366 and significantly accelerating declines after age 74. A similar interaction was observed for whole-brain FC. APOE status did not predict baseline connectivity or change in connectivity. After adjusting for network volume, changes in within-DMN connectivity were specifically associated with changes in episodic memory and processing speed but not working memory or executive functions. The relationship with processing speed was attenuated after covarying for white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and whole-brain FC, whereas within-DMN connectivity remained associated with memory above and beyond WMH and whole-brain FC. Whole-brain and DMN FC exhibit a nonlinear trajectory, with more rapid declines in older age and possibly increases in connectivity early in the aging process. Within-DMN connectivity is a marker of episodic memory performance even among cognitively healthy older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Cognition", "Default mode network", "Episodic memory", "Functional MRI", "Neuroimaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Apolipoproteins E", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reaction Time", "Temporal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043781463", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55972629500": {"Name": "Staffaroni A.M.", "AuthorID": "55972629500", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "55724408200": {"Name": "Brown J.A.", "AuthorID": "55724408200", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "56135574100": {"Name": "Casaletto K.B.", "AuthorID": "56135574100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57090390300": {"Name": "Elahi F.M.", "AuthorID": "57090390300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57201197710": {"Name": "Deng J.", "AuthorID": "57201197710", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57194623363": {"Name": "Cobigo Y.", "AuthorID": "57194623363", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57201194445": {"Name": "Mumford P.S.", "AuthorID": "57201194445", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57201194599": {"Name": "Walters S.", "AuthorID": "57201194599", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57193843212": {"Name": "Saloner R.", "AuthorID": "57193843212", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57191195272": {"Name": "Karydas A.", "AuthorID": "57191195272", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57210807888": {"Name": "Rosen H.J.", "AuthorID": "57210807888", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "35377631700": {"Name": "Miller B.L.", "AuthorID": "35377631700", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "56425848000": {"Name": "Seeley W.W.", "AuthorID": "56425848000", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Pathology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57219148089": {"Name": "Kramer J.H.", "AuthorID": "57219148089", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, Departments of  Neurology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "7005256475": {"Name": "Neuhaus J.", "AuthorID": "7005256475", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57215104726": {"Name": "Coppola G.", "AuthorID": "57215104726", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles"}}}
