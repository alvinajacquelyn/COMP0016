Methods Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years within the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening who were willing to take part in a secondary study were mailed a survey to evaluate menopausal symptom management. Use and perceived efficacy of CAMs for relief of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) upon discontinuation of HT were examined. Results The survey was sent to 15,000 women between July 2 and July 9, 2008. Seventy-one percent (10,662 of 15,000) responded, and 10,607 women with complete data were included. Ever use of HT was reported by 60.2% (6,383 of 10,607). At survey completion, 79.3% (5,060 of 6,383) had discontinued HT, with 89.7% (4,540 of 5,060) of the latter reporting using one or more CAMs for VMS relief. About 70.4% (3,561 of 5,060) used herbal remedies, with evening primrose oil (48.6%; 2,205 of 4,540) and black cohosh (30.3%;1,377 of 4,540) being most commonly used. Exercise was used by 68.2% (3,098 of 4,540), whereas other behavioral/lifestyle approaches were less frequently reported (13.9%; 629 of 4,540). Contrarily, more women (57%-72%) rated behavioral/lifestyle approaches as effective compared with herbal remedies (28%-46%; rating \u22654 on a \"helpfulness\" scale from 1-10). Among medical treatments, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were used by 10% and rated effective by 72.1%. Conclusions Although more women use over-the-counter medicines, behavioral/lifestyle approaches seem to provide better relief of VMS. There is a pressing need for better evidence-based lay information to support decision-making on CAM use for relief of VMS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complementary and alternative medicines", "Hormone therapy", "Menopause", "United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening", "Vasomotor symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Complementary Therapies", "Exercise", "Female", "Herbal Medicine", "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "Hot Flashes", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Sweating", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom", "Withholding Treatment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926650656", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"16205135000": {"Name": "Gentry-Maharaj A.", "AuthorID": "16205135000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "56441628800": {"Name": "Karpinskyj C.", "AuthorID": "56441628800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "57195423387": {"Name": "Glazer C.", "AuthorID": "57195423387", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "16834524900": {"Name": "Burnell M.", "AuthorID": "16834524900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "57193923293": {"Name": "Ryan A.", "AuthorID": "57193923293", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "7102793051": {"Name": "Fraser L.", "AuthorID": "7102793051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "34975076100": {"Name": "Jacobs I.", "AuthorID": "34975076100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}, "7202148555": {"Name": "Hunter M.S.", "AuthorID": "7202148555", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}}}
