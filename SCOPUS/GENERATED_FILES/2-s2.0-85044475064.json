Materials and methods: Hearing loss self-management assessments were conducted with 62 older adults. The factor structure of the assessment was determined by exploratory factor analysis. Multiple linear regression analyses identified significant contributors to the total score and to each of the extracted factors. Results: Three factors were identified, each representing a distinct domain of hearing loss self-management: Actions, Psychosocial Behaviours, and Knowledge. The most common significant predictor was hearing health care experience, which predicted self-management overall and in the Actions and Knowledge domains. Health literacy predicted hearing loss self-management overall and in the Psychosocial Behaviours domain. Actions were additionally predicted by hearing aid self-efficacy and gender, Psychosocial Behaviours by health locus of control, and Knowledge by age. Conclusions: The results of the factor analysis suggested that hearing loss self-management is a multidimensional construct. Each domain of hearing loss self-management was influenced by different contextual factors. Subsequent interventions to improve hearing loss self-management should therefore be domain-specific and tailored to relevant contextual factors.Implications for rehabilitation Hearing loss is a chronic health condition that requires on-going self-management of its effects on everyday life. Hearing loss self-management is multidimensional and encompasses the domains of Actions, Psychosocial Behaviours, and Knowledge. Different contextual factors influence each hearing loss self-management domain, including previous experience receiving hearing health care services, health literacy, hearing aid self-efficacy, health locus of control, age, and gender. Audiological rehabilitation programs should thus ensure that interventions to improve hearing loss self-management are domain- and context-specific.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic health condition", "hearing loss", "older adults", "self-management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognition", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Internal-External Control", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Problem Solving", "Self Efficacy", "Self-Management", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044475064", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"57193164856": {"Name": "Convery E.", "AuthorID": "57193164856", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "7004043266": {"Name": "Hickson L.", "AuthorID": "7004043266", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "7004166211": {"Name": "Keidser G.", "AuthorID": "7004166211", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}}}
