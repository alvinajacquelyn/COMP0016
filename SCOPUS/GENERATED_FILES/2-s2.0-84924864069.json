However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives\u2014crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crime location choice", "crime pattern theory", "journey to crime", "social cohesion", "theft from motor vehicle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924864069", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"8894355600": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "8894355600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "25825736600": {"Name": "Summers L.", "AuthorID": "25825736600", "AffiliationID": "60030452", "AffiliationName": "Texas State University"}}}
