However, there has been no previous attempt to investigate the extent to which these interactions are reflected in the use of metals and metallurgical technologies. Here we present analytical work on metallic artefacts and technical ceramics from Cerro La Cruz and Los Nogales, two Valley sites with evidence dated to the Late Period (ca. AD 1400-1540). The analyses included SEM-EDS, optical microscopy, petrography, XRD and FTIR. The results suggest that the sites represent different technological traditions. At Cerro La Cruz, the style of the metal objects and the lack of tin bronzes reflect continuity with an ancient metallurgical tradition with bases in the Diaguita Culture, rather than a wholesale adoption of an Inka metallurgical tradition. In Los Nogales, the presence of tin bronze and the use of perforated crucibles and other technical ceramics lined with bone ash is consistent with a tradition closely related to the Inka expansion and north-western Argentina, perhaps reflecting a stronger receptivity towards the new technologies. This disparity supports the idea that the Inka domination in the Valley was not forceful, and suggests a closer relationship between the state and some local groups, not previously identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central chile", "Copper metallurgy", "Crucibles", "FTIR", "Inka", "Late period", "Metallography", "Petrography", "SEM-EDS", "XRD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918817899", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"56450369600": {"Name": "Plaza M.", "AuthorID": "56450369600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "15026923300": {"Name": "Martin\u00f3n-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "15026923300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
