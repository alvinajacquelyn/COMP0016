Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is central to prevention of mother-to-child transmission and maternal ART continued postpartum allows breastfeeding for at least 1 year of life, with important benefits for the child. In the pre-ART era, it was suggested that HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children may be at higher morbidity and mortality risk than children of HIV-negative mothers, associated with maternal illness and death and the lack, or limited duration, of breastfeeding as recommended for preventing mother-to-child transmission at that time. This review summarizes the evidence on morbidity and mortality risk in HEU children compared with HIV-unexposed children, and assesses the likely impact of roll-out of ART, which prolongs maternal survival and allows breastfeeding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breastfeeding", "children", "HIV-exposed uninfected", "maternal HIV infection", "maternal survival", "morbidity", "mortality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942606978", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55355333800": {"Name": "Idele P.", "AuthorID": "55355333800", "AffiliationID": "115752883", "AffiliationName": "Data and Analytics Section, UNICEF New York"}, "7801376693": {"Name": "Chamla D.", "AuthorID": "7801376693", "AffiliationID": "108177749", "AffiliationName": "Health Section, UNICEF New York"}, "24765178500": {"Name": "Romano S.", "AuthorID": "24765178500", "AffiliationID": "105583501", "AffiliationName": "HIV/AIDS Section, UNICEF New York"}, "12646008400": {"Name": "Luo C.", "AuthorID": "12646008400", "AffiliationID": "105583501", "AffiliationName": "HIV/AIDS Section, UNICEF New York"}, "7102860013": {"Name": "Newell M.", "AuthorID": "7102860013", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
