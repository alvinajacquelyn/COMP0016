We show that for a natural class of such costs, the optimizer is given by the independent product measure all of whose factors are given by the one-body marginal. This is in striking contrast to standard finite-body OT problems, in which the optimizers are typically highly correlated, as well as to infinite-body OT problems with Gangbo\u2013Swiech cost. Moreover, by adapting a construction from the study of exchangeable processes in probability theory, we prove that the corresponding N-body OT problem is well approximated by the infinite-body problem. To our class belongs the Coulomb cost which arises in many-electron quantum mechanics. The optimal cost of the Coulombic N-body OT problem as a function of the one-body marginal density is known in the physics and quantum chemistry literature under the name SCE functional, and arises naturally as the semiclassical limit of the celebrated Hohenberg-Kohn functional. Our results imply that in the inhomogeneous high-density limit (i.e. N\u2192\u221e with arbitrary fixed inhomogeneity profile \u03c1/N), the SCE functional converges to the mean field functional. We also present reformulations of the infinite-body and N-body OT problems as two-body OT problems with representability constraints.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coulomb cost", "de Finetti\u2019s Theorem", "Density functional theory", "Exchange-correlation functional", "Finite exchangeability", "Hohenberg-Kohn functional", "Infinite-body optimal transport", "N-body optimal transport", "N-extendability", "N-representability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939451114", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"24485082800": {"Name": "Cotar C.", "AuthorID": "24485082800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "55921169700": {"Name": "Friesecke G.", "AuthorID": "55921169700", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "37054502700": {"Name": "Pass B.", "AuthorID": "37054502700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, University of Alberta"}}}
