Here, we demonstrate that Cdc42EP3/BORG2 is required for the matrix remodeling, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor-growth-promoting abilities of CAFs. Cdc42EP3 functions by coordinating the actin and septin networks. Furthermore, depletion of SEPT2 has similar effects to those of loss of Cdc42EP3, indicating a role for the septin network in the tumor stroma. Cdc42EP3 is upregulated early in fibroblast activation and precedes the emergence of the highly contractile phenotype characteristic of CAFs. Depletion of Cdc42EP3 in normal fibroblasts prevents their activation by cancer cells. We propose that Cdc42EP3 sensitizes fibroblasts to further cues\u2014in particular, those activating actomyosin contractility\u2014and thereby enables the generation of the pathological activated fibroblast state. Calvo et al. identify Cdc42EP3 as a regulator of the pro-tumorigenic functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Cdc42EP3 is upregulated during fibroblast activation and coordinates actin and septin rearrangements that are required for mechanotransduction and CAF functions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Fibroblasts", "GTP-Binding Protein Regulators", "Humans", "Mice", "Neoplasms", "Septins", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975781978", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7101900844": {"Name": "Calvo F.", "AuthorID": "7101900844", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Microenvironment Team, Division of Cancer Biology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "23027206500": {"Name": "Hooper S.", "AuthorID": "23027206500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "35551546000": {"Name": "Sahai E.", "AuthorID": "35551546000", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57189890946": {"Name": "Ranftl R.", "AuthorID": "57189890946", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Microenvironment Team, Division of Cancer Biology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56668531400": {"Name": "Farrugia A.J.", "AuthorID": "56668531400", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Microenvironment Team, Division of Cancer Biology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57208458979": {"Name": "Charras G.", "AuthorID": "57208458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6602352817": {"Name": "Bruckbauer A.", "AuthorID": "6602352817", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Lymphocyte Interaction Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute"}, "7003808673": {"Name": "Batista F.", "AuthorID": "7003808673", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Lymphocyte Interaction Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute"}}}
