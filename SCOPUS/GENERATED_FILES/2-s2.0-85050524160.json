These services have become extremely popular in recent years, but exactly how people interact with these services has not been studied in detail. We conducted a diary study with nine households to investigate this, and present the preliminary results in this paper. Participants took advantage of the freedom and choice these services provided, watching on different devices, in different locations, and for extended periods of time. However, the majority of viewing conformed to traditional patterns, occurring in the evening on large screens, though viewing on a laptop was slightly more popular than the television. We found that usage of on-demand services was influenced by situational factors such as location and the devices that are available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Film", "On-demand video", "Streaming, diary study", "Television"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diary study", "Large screen", "On-demand services", "Situational factors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050524160", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57191501022": {"Name": "Rigby J.M.", "AuthorID": "57191501022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "22833443900": {"Name": "Brumby D.P.", "AuthorID": "22833443900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.L.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "55258058900": {"Name": "Gould S.J.J.", "AuthorID": "55258058900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham"}}}
