About 25 genes have been verified as relevant to the disease process, with rare and common variation implicated. We used next generation sequencing and repeat sizing to comprehensively assay genetic variation in a panel of known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes in 1126 patient samples and 613 controls. About 10% of patients were predicted to carry a pathological expansion of the C9orf72 gene. We found an increased burden of rare variants in patients within the untranslated regions of known disease-causing genes, driven by SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, VCP, OPTN and UBQLN2. We found 11 patients (1%) carried more than one pathogenic variant (P = 0.001) consistent with an oligogenic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These findings show that the genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is complex and that variation in the regulatory regions of associated genes may be important in disease pathogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Association study", "Complex trait", "Neurodegeneration", "Polygenic inheritance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Variation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022019342", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56478135100": {"Name": "Morgan S.", "AuthorID": "56478135100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "55507350000": {"Name": "Shoai M.", "AuthorID": "55507350000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "57208749034": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "57208749034", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "55632439300": {"Name": "Shatunov A.", "AuthorID": "55632439300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, MauriceWohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College"}, "37113019000": {"Name": "Sproviero W.", "AuthorID": "37113019000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, MauriceWohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College"}, "55245748600": {"Name": "Jones A.R.", "AuthorID": "55245748600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, MauriceWohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College"}, "57192832172": {"Name": "Al Khleifat A.", "AuthorID": "57192832172", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, MauriceWohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College"}, "35370282000": {"Name": "Shaw C.E.", "AuthorID": "35370282000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, MauriceWohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College"}, "7003751621": {"Name": "Al-Chalabi A.", "AuthorID": "7003751621", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, MauriceWohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College"}, "7003290890": {"Name": "Malaspina A.", "AuthorID": "7003290890", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, North-East London and Essex Regional Motor Neuron Disease Care Centre"}, "57188987558": {"Name": "Morrison K.E.", "AuthorID": "57188987558", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60025225, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, MP801 University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401650160": {"Name": "Shaw P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401650160", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SiTraN), University of Sheffield"}, "57221060388": {"Name": "Sidle K.", "AuthorID": "57221060388", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005900136": {"Name": "Orrell R.W.", "AuthorID": "7005900136", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "12802595400": {"Name": "Fratta P.", "AuthorID": "12802595400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
