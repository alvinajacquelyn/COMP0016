KGaA, WeinheimThe gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) is expressed at high levels in naturally hyperthickened epidermal layers as well as pathological hyperkeratotic disease states, such as warts, psoriatic plaques, and chronic wound edges. The overexpression of Cx26 is also linked with inflammation, breakdown of the skin barrier function, and perturbed wound healing. Here, a collagen scaffold implanted into a rat excisional skin wound is used. This induces a foreign body type reaction characterized by epidermal thickening with elevated levels of Cx43 and Cx26, increased inflammation, and perturbed healing. This is reminiscent of a chronic skin wound. If the same scaffolds are coated with an antisense molecule specifically targeting Cx26 that has a slow sustained release, this prevents the abnormal upregulation of Cx26 protein at the wound edge. Knocking down Cx26 protein levels below those seen in normal wound healing has no adverse effects on the healing process but instead reduces the epidermal thickening and also the inflammatory response, while at the same time promotes the healing response. Treatment with Cx43/26 antisense may promote healing of chronic wounds. The Cx26 antisense may also be helpful in treating other skin conditions where Cx26 is overexpressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antisense delivery", "Cx26", "scaffold", "tissue repair"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antisense", "Collagen scaffolds", "Cx26", "Epidermal thickening", "Gap junction proteins", "Inflammatory response", "Skin barrier functions", "Tissue repair"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065054042", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"25931065800": {"Name": "Phillips A.R.J.", "AuthorID": "25931065800", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Department of Surgery, University of Auckland"}, "57208540090": {"Name": "Miles M.", "AuthorID": "57208540090", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Department of Surgery, University of Auckland"}, "24341622800": {"Name": "O'Neill S.", "AuthorID": "24341622800", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Department of Surgery, University of Auckland"}, "57203886780": {"Name": "Chin J.S.", "AuthorID": "57203886780", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore"}, "8656381200": {"Name": "Chew S.Y.", "AuthorID": "8656381200", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore"}, "57007906300": {"Name": "Madden L.", "AuthorID": "57007906300", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore"}, "57189644331": {"Name": "Soon A.", "AuthorID": "57189644331", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore"}, "56723339200": {"Name": "Hu R.", "AuthorID": "56723339200", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore"}, "7401884327": {"Name": "Becker D.L.", "AuthorID": "7401884327", "AffiliationID": "60113368", "AffiliationName": "Skin Research Institute Singapore"}, "55263090800": {"Name": "Gilmartin D.J.", "AuthorID": "55263090800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6602690023": {"Name": "Thrasivoulou C.", "AuthorID": "6602690023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7005843306": {"Name": "Jayasinghe S.N.", "AuthorID": "7005843306", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "BioPhysics Group, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicineand Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
