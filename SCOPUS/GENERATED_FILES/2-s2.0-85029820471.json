The ice sheet is modelled as an elastic plate and fluid flow is described by the velocity potential theory. The solution procedure is constructed based on the assumption that when the distance between two disturbances to the free surface is sufficiently large, the interactions between them involve only the travelling waves caused by the disturbances and the effect of the evanescent waves is ignored. The solution for the problem can then be obtained from those for a floating body without an ice sheet and for an ice sheet/free surface without a floating body. Both latter solutions have already been found previously and therefore there will be no additional effort in solution once the wide spacing approximation formulation is derived. Extensive numerical results are provided to show that the method is very accurate compared with the exact solution. The obtained formulations are then used to provide some insightful explanations for the physics of flow behaviour, as well as the mechanism for the highly oscillatory features of the hydrodynamic force and body motion. Some explicit equations are derived to show zero reflection by the polynya and peaks and troughs of the force and excited body motion. It is revealed that some of the peaks of the body motion are due to resonance while others are due to the wave characters in the polynya.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Explicit equations", "Hydrodynamic forces", "Interaction of waves", "Numerical results", "Solution procedure", "Travelling waves", "Velocity potentials", "Zero reflections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029820471", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56723490000": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56723490000", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "56969946300": {"Name": "Shi Y.", "AuthorID": "56969946300", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}}}
