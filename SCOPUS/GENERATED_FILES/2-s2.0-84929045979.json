Recent advances in cancer genomics, together with biochemical characterization of the APOBEC3 enzymes, have now implicated at least two family members in somatic mutagenesis during tumor development. We review the evidence linking these enzymes to carcinogenesis and highlight key questions, including the potential mechanisms that misdirect APOBEC3 activity to the host genome, the links to viral infection, and the association between a common APOBEC3 polymorphism and cancer risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["APOBEC", "Cancer", "Mutagenesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Cytosine Deaminase", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Mutagenesis", "Neoplasms", "Retroviridae", "Risk", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929045979", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"35548946900": {"Name": "Henderson S.", "AuthorID": "35548946900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "35480103200": {"Name": "Fenton T.", "AuthorID": "35480103200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute"}}}
