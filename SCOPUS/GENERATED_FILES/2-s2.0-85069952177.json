Here we quantitatively evaluate the contribution of rural residential emissions to PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm) and the impacts on health and climate. The clean energy transitions result in remarkable reductions in the contributions to ambient PM2.5, avoiding 130,000 (90,000\u2013160,000) premature deaths associated with PM2.5 exposure. The climate forcing associated with this sector declines from 0.057 \u00b1 0.016 W/m2 in 1992 to 0.031 \u00b1 0.008 W/m2 in 2012. Despite this, the large remaining quantities of solid fuels still contributed 14 \u00b1 10 \u03bcg/m3 to population-weighted PM2.5 in 2012, which comprises 21 \u00b1 14% of the overall population-weighted PM2.5 from all sources. Rural residential emissions affect not only rural but urban air quality, and the impacts are highly seasonal and location dependent.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air Pollutants", "Air Pollution", "Air Pollution, Indoor", "Energy-Generating Resources", "Family Characteristics", "Housing", "Humans", "Particulate Matter", "Rural Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069952177", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35254285100": {"Name": "Shen G.", "AuthorID": "35254285100", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "56963773000": {"Name": "Ru M.", "AuthorID": "56963773000", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Nicholas school of the Environment, Duke University"}, "56973181200": {"Name": "Du W.", "AuthorID": "56973181200", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "57188809034": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "57188809034", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "56450098700": {"Name": "Zhong Q.", "AuthorID": "56450098700", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "56028951800": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "56028951800", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "35768562400": {"Name": "Shen H.", "AuthorID": "35768562400", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "57193629831": {"Name": "Yun X.", "AuthorID": "57193629831", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "57193628565": {"Name": "Meng W.", "AuthorID": "57193628565", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "55705948900": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "55705948900", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "55538541400": {"Name": "Cheng H.", "AuthorID": "55538541400", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "8593703900": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "8593703900", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University"}, "7202041928": {"Name": "Tao S.", "AuthorID": "7202041928", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Sino-French Institute for Earth System Science, Peking University"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60160138", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia, Norwich"}}}
