Objectives: To quantify cause-specific mortality rates by socioeconomic status across seven health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) in five countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Nigeria) in the INDEPTH Network in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We linked demographic residence data with household survey data containing living standards and education information we used to create a poverty index. Person-years lived and deaths between 2003 and 2016 (periods varied by HDSS) were stratified in each HDSS by age, sex, year, and number of deprivations on the poverty index (0\u20138). Causes of death were assigned to each death using the InterVA-4 model based on responses to verbal autopsy questionnaires. We estimated rate ratios between socioeconomic groups (2\u20134 and 5\u20138 deprivations on our poverty index compared to 0\u20132 deprivations) for specific causes of death and calculated life expectancy for the deprivation groups. Results: Our pooled data contained almost 3.5 million person-years of observation and 25,038 deaths. All-cause mortality rates were higher among people in households with 5\u20138 deprivations on our poverty index compared to 0\u20132 deprivations, controlling for age, sex, and year (rate ratios ranged 1.42 to 2.06 across HDSS sites). The poorest group had consistently higher death rates in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions (rate ratios ranged 1.34\u20134.05) and for non-communicable diseases in several sites (1.14\u20131.93). The disparities in mortality between 5\u20138 deprivation groups and 0\u20132 deprivation groups led to lower life expectancy in the higher-deprivation groups by six years in all sites and more than 10 years in five sites. Conclusions: We show large disparities in mortality on the basis of socioeconomic status across seven HDSS in sub-Saharan Africa due to disparities in communicable disease mortality and from non-communicable diseases in some sites. Life expectancy gaps between socioeconomic groups within sites were similar to the gaps between high-income and lower-middle-income countries. Prevention and treatment efforts can benefit from understanding subpopulations facing higher mortality from specific conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cause of death", "life expectancy", "non-communicable disease", "verbal autopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cause of Death", "Demography", "Ethiopia", "Female", "Global Health", "Humans", "Kenya", "Life Expectancy", "Malawi", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mozambique", "Nigeria", "Population Surveillance", "Poverty", "Social Class", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065837521", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57211076754": {"Name": "Coates M.M.", "AuthorID": "57211076754", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Program in Global Noncommunicable Diseases and Social Change, Harvard Medical School"}, "57205759872": {"Name": "Marx A.", "AuthorID": "57205759872", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Program in Global Noncommunicable Diseases and Social Change, Harvard Medical School"}, "57189462853": {"Name": "Bukhman G.", "AuthorID": "57189462853", "AffiliationID": "60100270", "AffiliationName": "Partners In Health"}, "56563158400": {"Name": "Kamanda M.", "AuthorID": "56563158400", "AffiliationID": "100413834", "AffiliationName": "INDEPTH Network"}, "56111322000": {"Name": "Arikpo I.", "AuthorID": "56111322000", "AffiliationID": "60021765", "AffiliationName": "Cross River Health & Demographic Surveillance System (CRHDSS), University of Calabar"}, "14008831200": {"Name": "Chauque A.", "AuthorID": "14008831200", "AffiliationID": "105150194", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade da Manhi\u00e7a (CISM)"}, "57192953602": {"Name": "Mengesha M.M.", "AuthorID": "57192953602", "AffiliationID": "60071205", "AffiliationName": "College of Health and Medical Sciences, Haramaya University"}, "55318832100": {"Name": "Price A.J.", "AuthorID": "55318832100", "AffiliationID": "60072682", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Epidemiology and Intervention Research Unit"}, "56313537700": {"Name": "Sifuna P.", "AuthorID": "56313537700", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "US Army Medical Research Directorate\u2013Kenya (USAMRD-K)/Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)"}, "55349228500": {"Name": "Wamukoya M.", "AuthorID": "55349228500", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "15751707200": {"Name": "Sacoor C.N.", "AuthorID": "15751707200", "AffiliationID": "105150194", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade da Manhi\u00e7a (CISM)"}, "36480319200": {"Name": "Ogwang S.", "AuthorID": "36480319200", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "US Army Medical Research Directorate\u2013Kenya (USAMRD-K)/Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)"}, "54889668400": {"Name": "Assefa N.", "AuthorID": "54889668400", "AffiliationID": "60071205", "AffiliationName": "College of Health and Medical Sciences, Haramaya University"}, "6701313886": {"Name": "Crampin A.C.", "AuthorID": "6701313886", "AffiliationID": "60072682", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Epidemiology and Intervention Research Unit"}, "7801401361": {"Name": "Macete E.V.", "AuthorID": "7801401361", "AffiliationID": "105150194", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade da Manhi\u00e7a (CISM)"}, "16245470400": {"Name": "Kyobutungi C.", "AuthorID": "16245470400", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "18536940700": {"Name": "Meremikwu M.M.", "AuthorID": "18536940700", "AffiliationID": "60021765", "AffiliationName": "Cross River Health & Demographic Surveillance System (CRHDSS), University of Calabar"}, "9840738700": {"Name": "Otieno W.", "AuthorID": "9840738700", "AffiliationID": "60068012", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Maseno University School of Medicine"}, "57217185181": {"Name": "Byass P.", "AuthorID": "57217185181", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Aberdeen"}, "6602427333": {"Name": "Sankoh O.", "AuthorID": "6602427333", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "54901996800": {"Name": "Kintu A.", "AuthorID": "54901996800", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.
