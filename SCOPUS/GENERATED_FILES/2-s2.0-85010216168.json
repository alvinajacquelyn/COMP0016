All rights reserved.Mitochondria play key roles in numerous cellular processes, including ATP production, calcium homeostasis, and cell death pathways. In no cell type is their function more vital than in long-lived neurons, where mitochondria must be maintained for an entire lifetime, and where energy requirements are very high and long axons necessitate energy transport over large distances. While functioning mitochondria are key for maintaining cellular health, dysfunctional mitochondria can generate excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species that contribute to oxidative damage in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). It is therefore essential for the heavily damaged mitochondria to be removed to avoid their toxic accumulation. This occurs through a selective autophagic process, called mitophagy. The majority of what we know about mitophagy originates from the PD-associated genes PINK1 and Parkin, with research over the past 10 years shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of the process. In this chapter, we describe the mitophagy model and how it evolved in the last few years. We discuss the methodologies currently available to measure mitophagy, and we reflect on the outstanding questions that remain to be answered in order to further understand mitophagy and be able to target the process to treat or prevent PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autophagy", "E3 ubiquitin ligase", "Kinase", "Mitochondria", "Parkin", "Phosphorylation", "PINK1", "Proteasome", "Ubiquitin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010216168", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57193027977": {"Name": "King L.", "AuthorID": "57193027977", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57203606367": {"Name": "Plun-Favreau H.", "AuthorID": "57203606367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}}}
