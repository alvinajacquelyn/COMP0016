Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.We estimated the spontaneous mutation rate in Heliconius melpomene by genome sequencing of a pair of parents and 30 of their offspring, based on the ratio of number of de novo heterozygotes to the number of callable site-individuals. We detected nine new mutations, each one affecting a single site in a single offspring. This yields an estimated mutation rate of 2.9 \u00d7 10-9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 \u00d7 10-9-5.5 \u00d7 10-9), which is similar to recent estimates in Drosophila melanogaster, the only other insect species in which the mutation rate has been directly estimated. We infer that recent effective population size of H. melpomene is about 2 million, a substantially lower value than its census size, suggesting a role for natural selection reducing diversity. We estimate that H. melpomene diverged from its M\u00fcllerian comimic H. erato about 6 Ma, a somewhat later date than estimates based on a local molecular clock.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genome sequencing", "Heliconius", "Mutation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Butterflies", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Evolution, Molecular", "Female", "Genome, Insect", "Male", "Mutation Rate", "Phylogeny", "Population Density", "Selection, Genetic", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922371114", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7005114846": {"Name": "Keightley P.", "AuthorID": "7005114846", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "23490230600": {"Name": "Ness R.", "AuthorID": "23490230600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56507242700": {"Name": "Pinharanda A.", "AuthorID": "56507242700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "37088056500": {"Name": "Davey J.", "AuthorID": "37088056500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "6603932806": {"Name": "Jiggins C.", "AuthorID": "6603932806", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "9635004000": {"Name": "Simpson F.", "AuthorID": "9635004000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602134403": {"Name": "Dasmahapatra K.", "AuthorID": "6602134403", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "7202284097": {"Name": "Mallet J.", "AuthorID": "7202284097", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}}}
