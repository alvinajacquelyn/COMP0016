Historical records and anecdotal reports suggest that a disjunct population of okapi may have occurred south-west of the Congo River but the current distribution and status of the okapi in this region are not well known. Here we describe the use of non-invasive genetic identification for this species and assess the success of species identification from dung in the wild, which varied throughout the range. This variation is probably attributable to varying okapi population densities and/or different sample collection strategies across the okapi's distribution. Okapi were confirmed to occur south-west of the Congo River, in scattered localities west of the Lomami River. We demonstrated that non-invasive genetic methods can provide information on the distribution of cryptic, uncommon species that is difficult to obtain by other methods. Further investigation is required to genetically characterize the okapi across its range and to investigate the biogeographical processes that have led to the observed distribution of okapi and other fauna in the region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Democratic Republic of Congo", "dung sample", "Endangered", "endemic species", "Giraffidae", "okapi", "protected area"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951729076", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"55820272200": {"Name": "Stanton D.W.G.", "AuthorID": "55820272200", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "56840234000": {"Name": "Bruford M.W.", "AuthorID": "56840234000", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55319293600": {"Name": "Hart J.", "AuthorID": "55319293600", "AffiliationID": "113700457", "AffiliationName": "Lukuru Foundation, Projet Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba"}, "55360030600": {"Name": "Vosper A.", "AuthorID": "55360030600", "AffiliationID": "116055658", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Okapi Faunal Reserve"}, "8537811800": {"Name": "K\u00fcmpel N.F.", "AuthorID": "8537811800", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Programmes, Zoological Society of London"}, "57202341952": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57202341952", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7005260657": {"Name": "Ewen J.G.", "AuthorID": "7005260657", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
