Several groups have shown that positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) information alters meningioma targets contoured by single observers, but whether this translates into improved accuracy has not been defined. As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the cornerstone of meningioma target contouring, simultaneous PET/MRI may be superior to PET/CT. We assessed whether 68Ga DOTATATE PET imaging (from PET/CT and PET/MRI) reduced interobserver variability (IOV) in meningioma target volume contouring. Materials and methods Ten patients with meningioma underwent simultaneous 68Ga DOTATATE PET/MRI followed by PET/CT. They were selected as it was anticipated that target volume definition in their cases would be particularly challenging. Three radiation oncologists contoured target volumes according to an agreed protocol: gross tumour volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) on CT/MRI alone, CT/MRI+PET(CT) and CT/MRI+PET(MRI). GTV/CTV Kouwenhoven conformity levels (KCL), regions of contour variation and qualitative differences between PET(CT) and PET(MRI) were evaluated. Results There was substantial IOV in contouring. GTV mean KCL: CT/MRI 0.34, CT/MRI+PET(CT) 0.38, CT/MRI+PET(MRI) 0.39 (P = 0.06). CTV mean KCL: CT/MRI 0.31, CT/MRI+PET(CT) 0.35, CT/MRI+PET(MRI) 0.35 (P = 0.04 for all groups; P > 0.05 for individual pairs). One observer consistently contoured largest and one smallest. Observers rarely decreased volumes in relation to PET. Most IOV occurred in bone followed by dural tail, postoperative bed and venous sinuses. Tumour edges were qualitatively clearer on PET(MRI) versus PET(CT), but this did not affect contouring. Conclusion IOV in contouring challenging meningioma cases was large and only slightly improved with the addition of 68Ga DOTATATE PET. Simultaneous PET/MRI for meningioma contouring is feasible, but did not improve IOV versus PET/CT. Whether volumes can be safely reduced according to PET requires evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["68Gallium DOTATATE PET", "Contouring", "interobserver variability", "meningioma", "simultaneous PET/MRI", "target volume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Observer Variation", "Organometallic Compounds", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiotherapy, Conformal", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017520868", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55223843600": {"Name": "Maclean J.", "AuthorID": "55223843600", "AffiliationID": "60024764", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre"}, "6508180148": {"Name": "Fersht N.", "AuthorID": "6508180148", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "36991775200": {"Name": "Sullivan K.", "AuthorID": "36991775200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "8960246500": {"Name": "Kayani I.", "AuthorID": "8960246500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "8960246600": {"Name": "Dickson J.", "AuthorID": "8960246600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55993914100": {"Name": "O'Meara C.", "AuthorID": "55993914100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7102838197": {"Name": "Short S.", "AuthorID": "7102838197", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St James University Hospital"}}}
