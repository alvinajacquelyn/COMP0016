As a result, the use of AlxGa1-xAs in devices requiring high minority carrier lifetimes, such as solar cells, has been limited. Nonetheless, it has long been established that the substrate temperature is a key parameter in improving AlxGa1-xAs material quality. In order to optimize the growth temperature of 1.70-eV Al0.22Ga0.78As solar cells, five samples have been grown by Solid-Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy (SSMBE) at 580 \u00b0C, 600 \u00b0C, 620 \u00b0C, 640 \u00b0C, and 660 \u00b0C, respectively. A strong improvement in performance is observed with increasing the growth temperature from 580 \u00b0C to 620 \u00b0C. An open-circuit voltage above 1.21 V has in particular been demonstrated on the sample grown at 620 \u00b0C, translating into a bandgap-voltage offset Woc below 0.5 V. Above 620 \u00b0C, performances \u2013 in particular the short-circuit current density \u2013 moderately decrease. This trend is confirmed by photoluminescence, current density versus voltage characterization under illumination, and external quantum efficiency measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A3.
