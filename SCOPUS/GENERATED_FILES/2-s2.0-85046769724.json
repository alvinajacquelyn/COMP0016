Three trends provide evidence for this: (i) the number of firm level relevant factors for platform success is steadily increasing, (ii) contemporary cases of platform competition take less time to unfold, and (iii) industries converge. These trends suggest that there is a change: in the time required for relevant factors to influence platform competition, and in the trade-offs managers face when they take actions in platform development and competition, to influence the market outcome of such processes. Current frameworks in the literature do not account explicitly for such timing issues. The use of modelling and simulation, along empirical cases, is a way to incorporate timing and strategic action delays in platform competition research. We explore the multi-level research agenda this opens up and develop nine research questions for platform competition research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["competition", "platforms", "Simulation", "technology management"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046769724", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"54385627300": {"Name": "Papachristos G.", "AuthorID": "54385627300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "23669668900": {"Name": "van de Kaa G.", "AuthorID": "23669668900", "AffiliationID": "60117886, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Values, Technology and Innovation, Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, Delft Technical University"}}}
