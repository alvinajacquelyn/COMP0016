Eld. group, age >80 years) and compare their outcomes to a less elderly cohort (Eld. group, age 75-80 years) traditionally reported in the literature. Background: Limited data exist on peri-procedural and long-term outcomes following PCI in the V. Eld. (age >80 years), with under-representation of this cohort in randomized controlled trials. These patients present with advanced complex coronary disease and multiple comorbidities. Methods: All 580 consecutive patients aged \u226575 years (age 80 \u00b1 4.9 years, 57.4% males) undergoing PCI between April 2006 and November 2011 were included. A total of 624 consecutive lesions were identified and analyzed. All V. Eld. patients (n = 253) were subsequently selected, and their outcomes compared to Eld. patients (n = 327). Mean follow-up was 30.8 \u00b1 2.7 months with 98% clinical follow-up achieved. Results: All comparative data are expressed as (V. Eld. vs Eld.) unless otherwise specified. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the V. Eld. group (11.9% vs 6.1%), although this did not translate into a significant difference in cardiac mortality (6.3% vs 3.7%) or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (16.2% vs 12.5%). The composite incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, definite/probable stent thrombosis, and TIMI major bleed was 4.7%, 1.4% 1.9%, and 6.4%, respectively with no significant difference between both cohorts. Conclusions: This study demonstrates an acceptable occurrence of MI, death, repeat intervention, and stent thrombosis in a high-risk group of V. Eld. patients with de novo lesions. Age alone in the absence of other non-cardiac factors should not prohibit a patient from access to PCI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elderly percutaneous coronary intervention", "outcomes", "percutaneous coronary intervention/methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Graft Occlusion, Vascular", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Patient Selection", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Postoperative Complications", "Stroke", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021830426", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35777882300": {"Name": "Gerber R.T.", "AuthorID": "35777882300", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55270166100": {"Name": "Arri S.S.", "AuthorID": "55270166100", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57194714995": {"Name": "Mohamed M.O.", "AuthorID": "57194714995", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55127515000": {"Name": "Dhillon G.", "AuthorID": "55127515000", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57192081230": {"Name": "Bandali A.", "AuthorID": "57192081230", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57193153994": {"Name": "Harding I.", "AuthorID": "57193153994", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57194714471": {"Name": "Gifford J.", "AuthorID": "57194714471", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "56084344600": {"Name": "Sandler B.", "AuthorID": "56084344600", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57220331504": {"Name": "Corbo B.", "AuthorID": "57220331504", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "23493119900": {"Name": "McWilliams E.", "AuthorID": "23493119900", "AffiliationID": "60029131, 60026349", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Conquest Hospital Hastings, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
