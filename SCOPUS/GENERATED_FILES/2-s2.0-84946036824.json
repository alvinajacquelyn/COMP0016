The membrane-bound ligand Nogo-A (an isoform encoded by RTN4) induces inhibition of neurite outgrowth, cell spreading, adhesion and migration through multi-subunit receptor complexes. Here, we identified the four-transmembrane-spanning protein tetraspanin-3 (TSPAN3) as a new modulatory co-receptor for the Nogo-A inhibitory domain Nogo-A-\u039420. Single-molecule tracking showed that TSPAN3 molecules in the cell membrane reacted to binding of Nogo-A with elevated mobility, which was followed by association with the signaltransducing Nogo-A receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Subsequently, TSPAN3 was co-internalized as part of the Nogo-A-ligand-receptor complex into early endosomes, where it subsequently separated from Nogo-A and S1PR2 to be recycled to the cell surface. The functional importance of the Nogo-A-TSPAN3 interaction is shown by the fact that knockdown of TSPAN3 strongly reduced the Nogo-A-induced S1PR2 clustering, RhoA activation, cell spreading and neurite outgrowth inhibition. In addition to the modulatory functions of TSPAN3 on Nogo-A-S1PR2 signaling, these results illustrate the very dynamic spatiotemporal reorganizations of membrane proteins during ligand-induced receptor complex organization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Internalization", "Myelin-associated inhibitor", "Nogo-A", "Receptor complex", "Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2", "Tetraspanin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Endosomes", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mice", "Myelin Proteins", "NIH 3T3 Cells", "Receptors, Lysosphingolipid", "rhoA GTP-Binding Protein", "Signal Transduction", "Tetraspanins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946036824", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56737065400": {"Name": "Thiede-Stan N.K.", "AuthorID": "56737065400", "AffiliationID": "60005666, 60025858, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich, Dept. of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich"}, "6603649799": {"Name": "Tews B.", "AuthorID": "6603649799", "AffiliationID": "60016908, 60017059", "AffiliationName": "Schaller Research Group at the University of Heidelberg, The German Cancer Research Center, Division of Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Invasion"}, "8311127700": {"Name": "Ristic Z.", "AuthorID": "8311127700", "AffiliationID": "60005666, 60025858, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich, Dept. of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich"}, "56575934000": {"Name": "Schwab M.E.", "AuthorID": "56575934000", "AffiliationID": "60005666, 60025858, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich, Dept. of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich"}, "56712403200": {"Name": "Albrecht D.", "AuthorID": "56712403200", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "22834523500": {"Name": "Ewers H.", "AuthorID": "22834523500", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Free University Berlin, Institut for Chemistry and Biochemistry"}}}
