For biological applications, one of its key advantages is its ability to visualize substructure of single molecules and molecular complexes in an aqueous environment. Here, we describe the application of AFM to determine superstructure and secondary structure of surface-bound DNA. The method is also readily applicable to probe DNA-DNA interactions and DNA-protein complexes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AFM", "Atomic force microscopy", "DNA", "DNA-protein binding", "Double helix", "Supercoiling"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Nanotechnology", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Proteins", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990180335", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"47461610000": {"Name": "Pyne A.L.B.", "AuthorID": "47461610000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6701845862": {"Name": "Hoogenboom B.W.", "AuthorID": "6701845862", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
