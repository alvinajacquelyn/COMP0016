It is often difficult to reach and recruit individuals for research purposes regarding a stigmatized condition or situation. Yet, researchers in our field have recognized the importance of work in this area and have individually developed a range of strategies to reach, recruit, and work with these populations. This workshop will invite researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and compare strategies and experiences when working with stigmatized communities in the context of the ever-evolving nature of technology. The outcomes of the workshop will include an outline for an article that will summarize the strategies and practices discussed as well as identify the approaches that have led to the best outcomes across different populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Research with stigmatized populations", "Stigma", "Stigmatized populations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Research purpose", "Stigma", "Stigmatized populations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058110212", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57201296473": {"Name": "Maestre J.F.", "AuthorID": "57201296473", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Indiana University"}, "35782543700": {"Name": "Shih P.C.", "AuthorID": "35782543700", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Indiana University"}, "57204957310": {"Name": "Warner M.", "AuthorID": "57204957310", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23487628200": {"Name": "Yarosh S.", "AuthorID": "23487628200", "AffiliationID": "60005745", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}, "55217935200": {"Name": "Pater J.", "AuthorID": "55217935200", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Tech"}, "55837138900": {"Name": "Jacobs M.", "AuthorID": "55837138900", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard University"}, "35180130600": {"Name": "Marcu G.", "AuthorID": "35180130600", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan"}, "56426539400": {"Name": "Eikey E.V.", "AuthorID": "56426539400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
