Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate psychosocial outcomes and physical activity in participants of \u201cCoping Through Football\u201d (CTF), a London-based football intervention for people who receive secondary mental health care. Methods: In a one group pre-post study design, participants completed self-report measures on physical activity and mental well-being at baseline (i.e. when joining the intervention), and at 6 months and 12 months thereafter. Perceived quality of life was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF which assess domains such as physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships and environment. The Rosenberg Self-esteem scale was used to measure self-esteem in the participants. Self-reported physical activity (vigorous activity, moderate activity, walking and sitting) was assessed using the short form of the International Physical Activity questionnaire (IPAQ). Results: For the 6 months follow up, data was available for 72 participants; at 12 month follow up data was available for 32 participants. Levels of vigorous activity doubled between baseline (102.98 min/week) and the short term follow up (196.85 min/week) as well as between baseline (117.26 min/week) and the one year follow up (248.23 min/week). For moderate activity, we find similar results with an improvement from 78.13 min/week at baseline to 149 min/week at the short term follow up and an increase from 87.74 min/week at baseline to 209.61 min/week. Increases on psychosocial measures were more modest, reaching significance at only the 6 month time point. There were no statistically significant changes with regard to the time spent sitting or walking at either the 6 or the 12 month follow up. Conclusion: While the impact on psychosocial measures was only moderate, the increase in physical activity in participants encourages the use of adjunct football interventions for people with mental health problems as a means to increase physical activity levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evaluation", "Football", "Mental health", "Physical activity", "Public health", "Soccer", "Social inclusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043606277", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Community and Home Care", "NURS", "2905"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55662424300": {"Name": "Friedrich B.", "AuthorID": "55662424300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College"}, "7004241930": {"Name": "Mason O.", "AuthorID": "7004241930", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Surrey"}}}
