In patients with APS, aPL exert pathogenic actions by binding serum beta-2-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI) via its N-terminal domain I (DI). We previously showed that bacterially-expressed recombinant DI inhibits biological actions of IgG derived from serum of patients with APS (APS-IgG). DI is too small (7 kDa) to be a viable therapeutic agent. Addition of polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) to small molecules enhances the serum half-life, reduces proteolytic targeting and can decrease immunogenicity. It is a common method of tailoring pharmacokinetic parameters and has been used in the production of many therapies in the clinic. However, PEGylation of molecules may reduce their biological activity, and the size of the PEG group can alter the balance between activity and half-life extension. Here we achieve production of site-specific PEGylation of recombinant DI (PEG-DI) and describe the activities in vitro and in vivo of three variants with different size PEG groups. All variants were able to inhibit APS-IgG from: binding to whole \u03b22GPI in ELISA, altering the clotting properties of human plasma and promoting thrombosis and tissue factor expression in mice. These findings provide an important step on the path to developing DI into a first-in-class therapeutic in APS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiphospholipid syndrome", "Biologics", "Domain I", "PEGylation", "Therapeutics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Antibodies, Antiphospholipid", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "beta 2-Glycoprotein I", "Blood Coagulation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Thrombosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055781491", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56042622600": {"Name": "McDonnell T.C.R.", "AuthorID": "56042622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology Research, University College London"}, "15766296400": {"Name": "Pericleous C.", "AuthorID": "15766296400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology Research, University College London"}, "8504949600": {"Name": "Ripoll V.M.", "AuthorID": "8504949600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology Research, University College London"}, "57216022963": {"Name": "Giles I.P.", "AuthorID": "57216022963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology Research, University College London"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, UCL/UCLH/Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003289700": {"Name": "Ioannou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003289700", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, UCL/UCLH/Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology Research, University College London"}, "7202814111": {"Name": "Willis R.", "AuthorID": "7202814111", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "7007058345": {"Name": "Brasier A.R.", "AuthorID": "7007058345", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "7402467115": {"Name": "Gonzalez E.B.", "AuthorID": "7402467115", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "26533043400": {"Name": "Papalardo E.", "AuthorID": "26533043400", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "16314280100": {"Name": "Romay-Penabad Z.", "AuthorID": "16314280100", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "7004124902": {"Name": "Jamaluddin M.", "AuthorID": "7004124902", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}}}
