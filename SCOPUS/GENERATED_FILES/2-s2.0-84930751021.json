All rights reserved.Background/Objectives: There is growing evidence that early development of obesity increases cardiovascular risk later in life, but less is known about whether there are effects of long-term excess body weight on the biological drivers associated with the atherosclerotic pathway, particularly adipokines, inflammatory and endothelial markers. This paper therefore investigates the influence of overweight across the life course on levels of these markers at retirement age. Subjects/Methods: Data from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (n = 1784) were used to examine the associations between overweight status at 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 15, 20, 26, 36, 43, 53 and 60-64 years (body mass index (BMI) \u2265 25 kg m<sup>-2</sup> for adult ages and gender-specific cut-points for childhood ages equivalent to BMI \u2265 25 kg m<sup>-2</sup>) and measurements of adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and endothelial markers (E-selectin, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and von Willebrand factor) at 60-64 years. In addition, the fit of different life course models (sensitive periodsaccumulation) were compared using partial F-tests. Results: In age- and sex-adjusted models, overweight at 11 years and onwards was associated with higher leptin, CRP and IL-6 and lower adiponectin; overweight at 15 years and onwards was associated with higher E-selectin and t-PA. Associations between overweight at all ages earlier than 60-64 with leptin, adiponectin, CRP and IL-6 were reduced but remained apparent after adjustment for overweight at 60-64 years; whereas those with E-selectin and t-PA were entirely explained. An accumulation model best described the associations between overweight across the life course with adipokines and inflammatory markers, whereas for the endothelial markers, the sensitive period model for 60-64 years provided a slightly better fit than the accumulation model. Conclusions: Overweight across the life course has a cumulative influence on adipokines, inflammatory and possibly endothelial markers. Avoidance of overweight from adolescence onwards is likely important for cardiovascular disease prevention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adiponectin", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aging", "Biomarkers", "Body Mass Index", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "E-Selectin", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Leptin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "von Willebrand Factor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930751021", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"36632716100": {"Name": "Murray E.T.", "AuthorID": "36632716100", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St. George's University of London"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St. George's University of London"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "26323396400": {"Name": "Wills A.", "AuthorID": "26323396400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60032768, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes, University College London"}}}
