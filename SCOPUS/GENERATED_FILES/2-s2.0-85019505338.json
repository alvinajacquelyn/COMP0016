Gender differences in these associations were also explored. Methods: A novel statistical method-multi-channel sequence analysis-defined workfamily life courses between the ages of 16 and 42 years, combining annual information on work, partnership and parenthood. Associations between work-family life courses and inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor] and cortisol at age 44/45 years were tested using multivariate linear regression using multiply- imputed data on almost 6500 participants from the National Child Development Study 1958 British birth cohort. Results: Compared with those who combined strong ties to paid work with later transitions to stable family lives ('Work, later family' group), 'Teen parents' had higher CRP [40.6% higher, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.6, 87.0] and fibrinogen (7.8% higher, 95% CI: 2.3, 13.5) levels, and homemakers ('No paid work, early family') had raised fibrinogen levels (4.7% higher, 95% CI: 0.7, 9.0), independent of childhood health and socioeconomic position, adult socioeconomic position, health behaviours and body mass index (BMI). Those who combined later transitions to stable family ties with a career break for childrearing had higher post-waking cortisol than the 'Work, later family' group; however, no associations were seen for other work-family types, therefore suggesting a null finding with cortisol. No statistically significant gender interactions in associations between work-family types and inflammatory or cortisol outcomes were found. Conclusions: Work-family life courses characterised by early parenthood or weak work ties were associated with a raised risk profile in relation to chronic inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortisol", "Inflammation", "Life course", "National Child Development Study", "Parenthood", "Partnerships", "Sequence analysis", "Work"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Family Relations", "Female", "Fibrinogen", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Inflammation", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Occupational Stress", "Risk Factors", "Social Class", "United Kingdom", "von Willebrand Factor", "Work-Life Balance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019505338", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"54410939600": {"Name": "Lacey R.E.", "AuthorID": "54410939600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6507035657": {"Name": "McMunn A.", "AuthorID": "6507035657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57189230664": {"Name": "Kumari M.", "AuthorID": "57189230664", "AffiliationID": "60102147, 60001359", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}, "37100996000": {"Name": "Booker C.", "AuthorID": "37100996000", "AffiliationID": "60102147, 60001359", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}, "57203548208": {"Name": "Worts D.", "AuthorID": "57203548208", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "7202803142": {"Name": "McDonough P.", "AuthorID": "7202803142", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}}}
