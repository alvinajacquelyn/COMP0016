Design Cohort study. Methods Two hundred forty-seven eyes of 140 children with uveitis were evaluated for the development of vision-affecting cataract. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected between the time of presentation and the first instance cataract was recorded or findings at final follow-up. Main outcome measures included the prevalence of cataract and distribution by type of uveitis, incidence of new onset cataract time to cataract development, and risk factors for the development of cataract. Results The prevalence of cataract in our cohort was 44.2% and was highest among eyes with panuveitis (77.1%), chronic anterior uveitis (48.3%), and intermediate uveitis (48.0%). The overall incidence of newly diagnosed cataract was 0.09 per eye-year, with an estimated 69% to develop uveitis-related cataract with time. The main factors related with cataract development were the number of uveitis flares per year (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.06 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.15\u20134.35], P <.001), cystoid macular edema (HR = 2.87 [95% CI, 1.41\u20135.82], P =.004), posterior synechia at presentation (HR = 2.85 [95% CI, 1.53\u20135.30], P = .001), and use of local injections of corticosteroids (HR = 2.37 [95% CI, 1.18\u20134.75], P =.02). Treatments with systemic and topical corticosteroids were not significant risk factors. Conclusions In this study, we found that development of cataract is common among pediatric eyes with uveitis and is most strongly related to the extent of inflammation recurrences and ocular complications. We suggest that controlling the inflammation, even using higher doses of systemic and topical corticosteroids, is of importance in preventing ocular complications, such as cataract.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cataract", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Israel", "Male", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Uveitis", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015457288", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7801647943": {"Name": "Blum-Hareuveni T.", "AuthorID": "7801647943", "AffiliationID": "115111096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Galilee Medical Center"}, "57193072956": {"Name": "Sharief L.", "AuthorID": "57193072956", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "15035438500": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "15035438500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57201661157": {"Name": "Tomkins-Netzer O.", "AuthorID": "57201661157", "AffiliationID": "60022403, 60028807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57193652267": {"Name": "Hareuveni G.", "AuthorID": "57193652267", "AffiliationID": "115111096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Galilee Medical Center"}, "56669720100": {"Name": "Seguin-Greenstein S.", "AuthorID": "56669720100", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7402838329": {"Name": "Kramer M.", "AuthorID": "7402838329", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "57189054218": {"Name": "Sharon Y.", "AuthorID": "57189054218", "AffiliationID": "60022119", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Rabin Medical Center"}, "6603845289": {"Name": "Friling R.", "AuthorID": "6603845289", "AffiliationID": "60015234", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Ophthalmology Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel"}}}
