Methods: Literature searches were conducted and identified 36 relevant papers from the period 1908\u20132016. Results: The systematic review found that many children experience difficulties in a wide range of psychosocial domains. Quality of life can also be significantly reduced. Inconsistent findings regarding the correlates of outcome are likely due to methodological limitations. These issues include small and heterogeneous samples, lack of control groups, and measurement difficulties. Conclusions: This systematic review strongly indicates that childhood stroke can affect a myriad of psychosocial domains and a child\u2019s quality of life. Methodological issues, particularly around heterogeneous samples and measures, limit the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the predictors of outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior", "childhood stroke", "outcome", "psychosocial", "quality of life", "school"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Social Behavior", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013031409", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"56229807700": {"Name": "O\u2019Keeffe F.", "AuthorID": "56229807700", "AffiliationID": "106764115", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, Co"}, "7404245327": {"Name": "King J.", "AuthorID": "7404245327", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Health and Educational Psychology, University College London"}, "57193330813": {"Name": "Murphy O.", "AuthorID": "57193330813", "AffiliationID": "106764115", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, Co"}, "56579806000": {"Name": "Stark D.", "AuthorID": "56579806000", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7102334584": {"Name": "Ganesan V.", "AuthorID": "7102334584", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7401632130": {"Name": "Murphy T.", "AuthorID": "7401632130", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}}}
