In doing so, it identifies the main concepts and ideas central to understanding the institutional change the IAHRS has experienced over the past six decades. Since the adoption of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man by the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1948, the IAHRS has undergone a series of institutional changes and transformations that have affected and been affected by the System\u2019s normative leanings, rules of procedure and institutional design, as well as by the position of the System within the broader landscape of the Americas. This special issue explores these changes from a variety of angles, including the process of change in historical context, normative and legal changes in the Inter-American Court\u2019s jurisprudence, and the changing relationship between the IAHRS and other regional and international human rights institutions. This special issue features contributions and insights from the disciplines of history, law, and political science, among others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Institutional change", "Inter-American commission on human rights", "Inter-American court of human rights", "International courts", "International norms", "Latin America"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055504781", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55479803900": {"Name": "Engstrom P.", "AuthorID": "55479803900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of the Americas, University College London"}, "36504116100": {"Name": "Hillebrecht C.", "AuthorID": "36504116100", "AffiliationID": "60026306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"}}}
