I present a critical discussion of the atheoretical style with which \"behavioral\" themes are often disseminated: a purely anecdotal style in popular expositions, simplistic cost- benefit modeling in pieces that target a wide audience of academic economists, and the practice of capturing psychological forces by distorting familiar functional forms. I argue that the subject of \"psychology and economics\" is intrinsically foundational, and that a heavier dose of abstract theorizing is essential for it to realize its transformative potential.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069969047", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602397499": {"Name": "Spiegler R.", "AuthorID": "6602397499", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60159834", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London, Centre for Macroeconomics"}}}
