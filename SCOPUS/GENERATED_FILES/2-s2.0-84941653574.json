However, treatment of advanced ovarian cancer patients with a neutralizing IL6 antibody yielded little efficacy in a previous phase II clinical trial. Here, we report results that may explain this outcome, based on the finding that neutralizing antibodies to IL6 and STAT3 inhibition are sufficient to upregulate the EGFR pathway in high-grade serous and other ovarian cancer cells. Cell treatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib abolished upregulation of the EGFR pathway. Combining neutralizing IL6 antibodies and gefitinib inhibited malignant cell growth in 2D and 3D culture. We found that ErbB-1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells examined, contrasting with plasma membrane localization in lung cancer cells. Treatment with anti-IL6, gefitinib, or their combination all led to partial restoration of ErbB-1 on the plasma membrane. In vivo experiments confirmed the effects of IL6 inhibition on the EGFR pathway and the enhanced activity of a combination of anti-IL6 antibodies and gefitinib on malignant cell growth. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical rationale to combine anti-IL6 and gefitinib to treat patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Cell Nucleus", "Drug Synergism", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Nude", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Protein Transport", "Quinazolines", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Tumor Burden", "Up-Regulation", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941653574", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35750402800": {"Name": "Milagre C.", "AuthorID": "35750402800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "54787646900": {"Name": "Gopinathan G.", "AuthorID": "54787646900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35784133000": {"Name": "Everitt G.", "AuthorID": "35784133000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55482230600": {"Name": "Thompson R.", "AuthorID": "55482230600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8748453900": {"Name": "Kulbe H.", "AuthorID": "8748453900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35279917300": {"Name": "Grose R.", "AuthorID": "35279917300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005681227": {"Name": "Balkwill F.", "AuthorID": "7005681227", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7201452947": {"Name": "Zhong H.", "AuthorID": "7201452947", "AffiliationID": "60005634", "AffiliationName": "MedImmune"}, "7101969021": {"Name": "Hollingsworth R.", "AuthorID": "7101969021", "AffiliationID": "60005634", "AffiliationName": "MedImmune"}, "35271003200": {"Name": "Bowtell D.", "AuthorID": "35271003200", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Genomics and Genetics Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre"}, "6701713285": {"Name": "Hochhauser D.", "AuthorID": "6701713285", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
