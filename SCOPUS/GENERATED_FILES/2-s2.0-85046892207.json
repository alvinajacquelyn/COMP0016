All rights reserved.Deep neural networks have achieved impressive successes in fields ranging from object recognition to complex games such as Go 1,2 . Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning 3-5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex 6 . Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space 7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration) 6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation) 7,10,11 . Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types 12 . We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments - optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation 7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomimetics", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Environment", "Grid Cells", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Neural Networks (Computer)", "Spatial Navigation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046892207", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57190662759": {"Name": "Banino A.", "AuthorID": "57190662759", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computation, Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "55752137100": {"Name": "Uria B.", "AuthorID": "55752137100", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "53063236700": {"Name": "Blundell C.", "AuthorID": "53063236700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "6503977179": {"Name": "Lillicrap T.", "AuthorID": "6503977179", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "23009255100": {"Name": "Mirowski P.", "AuthorID": "23009255100", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57194211707": {"Name": "Pritzel A.", "AuthorID": "57194211707", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56219505000": {"Name": "Chadwick M.J.", "AuthorID": "56219505000", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "14821795500": {"Name": "Degris T.", "AuthorID": "14821795500", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "6603423011": {"Name": "Modayil J.", "AuthorID": "6603423011", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56080177300": {"Name": "Wayne G.", "AuthorID": "56080177300", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57202037578": {"Name": "Soyer H.", "AuthorID": "57202037578", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57202228707": {"Name": "Viola F.", "AuthorID": "57202228707", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57202230183": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "57202230183", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "35322323200": {"Name": "Goroshin R.", "AuthorID": "35322323200", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "40661683300": {"Name": "Rabinowitz N.", "AuthorID": "40661683300", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "36464144900": {"Name": "Pascanu R.", "AuthorID": "36464144900", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56536156200": {"Name": "Beattie C.", "AuthorID": "56536156200", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56535950000": {"Name": "Petersen S.", "AuthorID": "56535950000", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56536367700": {"Name": "Sadik A.", "AuthorID": "56536367700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57202238940": {"Name": "Gaffney S.", "AuthorID": "57202238940", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56535990600": {"Name": "King H.", "AuthorID": "56535990600", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "25646533000": {"Name": "Kavukcuoglu K.", "AuthorID": "25646533000", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "15839738700": {"Name": "Hassabis D.", "AuthorID": "15839738700", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "8724445700": {"Name": "Hadsell R.", "AuthorID": "8724445700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "8650774800": {"Name": "Kumaran D.", "AuthorID": "8650774800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computation, Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "13405610800": {"Name": "Barry C.", "AuthorID": "13405610800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
