Observations resumed following the Space Shuttle SMM Repair Mission in April 1984 and continued until November 1989. BCS spectra have been widely used in the past to obtain temperatures, emission measures, and turbulent and bulk flows during flares, as well as element abundances. Instrumental details including calibration factors not previously published are given here, and the in-orbit performance of the BCS is evaluated. Some significant changes during the mission are described, and recommendations for future instrumentation are made. Using improved estimates for the instrument parameters and operational limits, it is now possible to obtain de-convolved calibrated spectra that show finer detail than before, providing the means for improved interpretation of the physics of the emitting plasmas. The results indicate how historical archived data can be re-used to obtain enhanced and new, scientifically valuable results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flares, spectrum", "Spectral line, intensity and diagnostics", "Spectrum, X-ray"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016424869", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7004227090": {"Name": "Rapley C.", "AuthorID": "7004227090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "8335578500": {"Name": "Sylwester J.", "AuthorID": "8335578500", "AffiliationID": "60021642, 60006353", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "7201518177": {"Name": "Phillips K.", "AuthorID": "7201518177", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Earth Sciences Department, Natural History Museum"}}}
