As an alternative approach, we present the design and implementation of VoxBox, a tangible system for gathering opinions on a range of topics in situ at an event through playful and engaging interaction. We discuss the design principles we employed in the creation of VoxBox and show how they encouraged wider participation, by grouping similar questions, encouraging completion, gathering answers to open and closed questions, and connecting answers and results. We evaluate these principles through observations from an initial deployment and discuss how successfully these were implemented in the design of VoxBox.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crowd engagement", "Design research", "Gathering opinions", "Playful", "Public opinion", "Tangible interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crowd engagement", "Design research", "Gathering opinions", "Playful", "Public opinions", "Tangible interaction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924050208", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"35092348300": {"Name": "Golsteijn C.", "AuthorID": "35092348300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ICRI Cities, University College"}, "35810143200": {"Name": "Gallacher S.", "AuthorID": "35810143200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ICRI Cities, University College"}, "56278736400": {"Name": "Koeman L.", "AuthorID": "56278736400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ICRI Cities, University College"}, "56536182300": {"Name": "Wall L.", "AuthorID": "56536182300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ICRI Cities, University College"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ICRI Cities, University College"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ICRI Cities, University College"}, "56537074700": {"Name": "Andberg S.", "AuthorID": "56537074700", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki"}}}
