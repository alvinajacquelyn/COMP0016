The refrigeration is implemented by a probe, consisting of a network of interacting spins. The protocol involves two operations: (i) free evolution of the probe; and (ii) a swap gate between one spin in the probe and the thermal qubit we wish to cool. We show that if the initial state of the probe falls within a suitable range, and the free evolution of the probe is both unital and conserves the excitation in the z direction, then the cooling protocol will always succeed, with an efficiency that depends on the rate of spin dephasing and the swap-gate fidelity. Furthermore, measuring the probe after it has cooled many qubits provides an estimate of their temperature. We provide a specific example where the probe is a Heisenberg spin chain, and suggest a physical implementation using electronic spins in diamond. Here, the probe is constituted of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, while the thermal qubits are dark spins. By using a novel pulse sequence, a chain of NV centers can be made to evolve according to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. This proposal allows for a range of applications, such as NV-based nuclear magnetic resonance of photosensitive molecules kept in a dark spot on a sample, and it opens up possibilities for the study of quantum thermodynamics, environment-assisted sensing, and many-body physics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic spins", "Heisenberg spin chains", "Initial state", "Nitrogen vacancies", "Photosensitive molecules", "Pulse sequence", "Quantum thermodynamics", "Spin dephasing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046537153", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36453199300": {"Name": "Mohammady M.", "AuthorID": "36453199300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "6603799403": {"Name": "Omar Y.", "AuthorID": "6603799403", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "57192835375": {"Name": "Choi H.", "AuthorID": "57192835375", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "55359803300": {"Name": "Trusheim M.", "AuthorID": "55359803300", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "8534954700": {"Name": "Englund D.", "AuthorID": "8534954700", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "8958172800": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "8958172800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
