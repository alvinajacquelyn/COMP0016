The fluid is assumed to be a dielectric of infinite depth. It is bounded above by another fluid which is hydrodynamically passive and perfectly conducting. The problem is solved numerically by time-dependent conformal mapping methods. Fully nonlinear waves are presented, and their stability and dynamics are studied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Solitary wave", "Surface wave", "Wave interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conformal mapping method", "Fully nonlinear", "Time dependent", "Vertical electric fields", "Wave interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020639787", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"56640563600": {"Name": "Gao T.", "AuthorID": "56640563600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7006057335": {"Name": "Papageorgiou D.", "AuthorID": "7006057335", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "7005594518": {"Name": "Vanden-Broeck J.", "AuthorID": "7005594518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7006718746": {"Name": "Milewski P.", "AuthorID": "7006718746", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}}}
