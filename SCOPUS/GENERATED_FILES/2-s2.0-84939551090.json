A better understanding of influences on sustaining and changing inactive lifestyles is needed. We aimed to establish whether leisure time inactivity was stable in midadulthood and whether early life factors were associated with inactivity patterns. Methods In the 1958 British birth cohort (n = 12,271), leisure time inactivity (frequency, less than once a week) assessed at 33 and 50 yr was categorized as \"never inactive,\" \"persistently inactive,\" \"deteriorating,\" or \"improving.\" Early life factors (birth to 16 yr) were categorized into three (physical, social, and behavioral) domains. Using multinomial logistic regression, we assessed associations with inactivity persistence and change of factors within each early life domain and the three domains combined with and without adjustment for adult factors. Results Inactivity prevalence was similar at 33 and 50 yr (approximately 31%), but 17% deteriorated and 18% improved with age. In models adjusted for all domains simultaneously, factors associated with inactivity persistence versus never inactive were prepubertal stature (8% lower risk/height SD), poor hand control/coordination (17% higher risk/increase on four-point scale), cognition (16% lower/SD in ability) (physical); parental divorce (25% higher), class at birth (7% higher/reduction on four-point scale), minimal parental education (16% higher), household amenities (2% higher/increase in 19-point score (high = poor)) (social); and inactivity (22% higher/reduction in activity on four-point scale), low sports aptitude (47% higher), smoking (30% higher) (behavioral). All except stature, parental education, sports aptitude, and smoking were associated also with inactivity deterioration. Poor hand control/coordination was the only factor associated with improved status (13% lower/increase on four-point scale) versus persistently inactive. Conclusions Adult leisure time inactivity is moderately stable. Early life factors are associated with persistent and deteriorating inactivity over decades in midadulthood but rarely with improvement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRITAIN", "COHORT STUDY", "LEISURE TIME PHYSICAL INACTIVITY", "LIFE COURSE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Height", "Cognition", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Longitudinal Studies", "Middle Aged", "Motor Skills", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Social Behavior", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939551090", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"54969700200": {"Name": "Pereira S.", "AuthorID": "54969700200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55605020600": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "55605020600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57203229564": {"Name": "Power C.", "AuthorID": "57203229564", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
