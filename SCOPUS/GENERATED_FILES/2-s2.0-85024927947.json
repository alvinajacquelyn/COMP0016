We have assessed patient treatment preferences and their outcomes over a 12-month period from January 1 2009 to December 31 2009. Patients and Methods: A retrospective database of all patients with SRU IDO was reviewed for patient demographics, treatment preference, and outcome. All patients attending for treatment in the time period were offered: no further treatment, repeat bladder training \u00b1 antimuscarinic (BT \u00b1 AM), acupuncture, intravesical botulinum toxin injection, sacral neuromodulation (SNM), clam cystoplasty \u00b1 Mitrofanoff channel formation, and ileal conduit. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis of outcomes was done by Chi-square test, and statistical significance was determined as P< 0.05. Results: A total of 217 patients with SRU IDO underwent primary treatment in this time period, with a median age of 56 years and follow-up for a minimum of 12 months' posttreatment to determine outcome. No patients opted for any further treatment or an ileal conduit. The majority of patients opted for intravesical botulinum toxin injections and SNM with similar success rates (approximately 70%). A small number of patients decided to have nonsurgical interventions (BT \u00b1 AM or acupuncture) and had a broadly similar success rate (50%). A minority opted for clam cystoplasty \u00b1 Mitrofanoff channel formation-this group reported the highest success rate at 86%. Conclusions: Treatment options in SRU IDO are diverse, with the majority of patients opting for minimally invasive surgery. Clinicians should be familiar with all treatment options for management of SRU IDO.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Detrusor overactivity", "patient preference", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024927947", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57195039624": {"Name": "Fontaine C.L.", "AuthorID": "57195039624", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57189627676": {"Name": "Rudd I.", "AuthorID": "57189627676", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "55851940397": {"Name": "Hamid R.", "AuthorID": "55851940397", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "6506281538": {"Name": "Ockrim J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506281538", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}}}
