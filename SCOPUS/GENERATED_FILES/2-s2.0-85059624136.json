We employed DNA origami to control the nanoscale spatial organization of integrin- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-binding ligands that modulate epidermal cancer cell behavior. By organizing these multivalent DNA nanostructures in nanoarray configurations on nanopatterned surfaces, we demonstrated the cooperative behavior of integrin and EGF ligands in the spreading of human cutaneous melanoma cells: this cooperation was shown to depend on both the number and ratio of the selective ligands employed. Notably, the multivalent biochips we have developed allowed for this cooperative effect to be demonstrated with single-molecule control and nanoscale spatial resolution. By and large, the platform presented here is of general applicability for the study, with molecular control, of different multivalent interactions governing biological processes from the function of cell-surface receptors to protein-ligand binding and pathogen inhibition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomimetic nanoarrays", "cancer cell", "cooperativity", "DNA nanotechnology", "multivalency", "single molecule", "spatial control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cancer cells", "Cooperativity", "DNA nanotechnology", "Multivalency", "Nanoarrays", "Single molecule", "Spatial control", "Biomimetic Materials", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA", "Epidermal Cells", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "Humans", "Integrins", "Ligands", "Melanoma", "Microarray Analysis", "Nanotechnology", "Protein Binding", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059624136", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193794756": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "57193794756", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Materials Research Institute, Institute of Bioengineering, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57204938726": {"Name": "Perez-Garrido S.", "AuthorID": "57204938726", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60012754, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Cancer Research UK Centre of Excellence, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55406724100": {"Name": "Palma M.", "AuthorID": "55406724100", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Materials Research Institute, Institute of Bioengineering, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57205344217": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "57205344217", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60012754, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Cancer Research UK Centre of Excellence, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57074911000": {"Name": "Marshall J.F.", "AuthorID": "57074911000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60012754, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Cancer Research UK Centre of Excellence, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
