This phenomenon is traditionally studied as a kind of imperfect column buckling problem. We study lateral buckling as a genuinely localised buckling phenomenon governed by a different static instability, with a different critical load. No ad hoc assumptions need to be made. We combine this buckling analysis with a detailed state-of-the-art nonlinear pipe-soil interaction model that accounts for the effect of lateral breakout resistance. This allows us to investigate the effect of initial embedment of subsea pipelines on their load-deflection behaviour. Parameter studies reveal a limit to the temperature difference for safe operation of the pipeline, in the sense that for higher temperature differences a localised buckling mode has lower total energy than the straight unbuckled pipe. Localised lateral buckling may then occur if the pipe is sufficiently imperfect or sufficiently dynamically perturbed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Axial compressive forces", "Buckling analysis", "High temperature condition", "Localised buckling", "Nonlinear pipe-soil interactions", "Nonlinear soil resistance", "Static instability", "Temperature differences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029798842", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56159250900": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56159250900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7005973659": {"Name": "van der Heijden G.", "AuthorID": "7005973659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
