Two configurations-fully covered floodplain and one-line obstructions-are considered, and the hydraulic properties are compared to those of a smooth, unobstructed compound channel. Particular attention is given to the effect of obstruction (i.e., vegetation) density on the rating curve, drag coefficients, and spanwise profiles of streamwise velocity. Flow resistance is estimated using an established approach, and the results are in agreement with other experimental studies. It was shown that the obstruction configuration significantly influences the flow velocity in the main channel, and in the case of one-line obstructions the floodplain velocity is higher than for an unobstructed channel for a given flow rate. Spanwise velocity profiles exhibit markedly different characters in the one-line and fully covered configurations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compound channel", "Drag", "Rating curve", "Spanwise velocity profile", "Vegetation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compound channel", "Conveyance capacity", "Emergent vegetation", "Hydraulic properties", "Rating curve", "Spanwise velocity", "Steady uniform flows", "Stream-wise velocities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029533943", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"]], "AuthorData": {"56341054100": {"Name": "Mulahasan S.", "AuthorID": "56341054100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff Univ., The Parade"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff Univ., The Parade"}, "55877278800": {"Name": "McSherry R.", "AuthorID": "55877278800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff Univ., The Parade"}}}
