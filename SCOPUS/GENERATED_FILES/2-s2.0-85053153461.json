The paper identifies open problems that have yet to receive significant attention from the scientific community, yet which have potential for profound real world impact, formulating these as research questions that, we believe, are ripe for exploration and that would make excellent topics for research projects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compositional reasoning", "Flaky test", "Infer", "Sapienz", "SBSE", "Separation Logic", "Testing", "Verification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compositional reasoning", "Infer", "Sapienz", "SBSE", "Separation logic"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053153461", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook London, University College London"}, "6701805922": {"Name": "O'Hearn P.", "AuthorID": "6701805922", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook London, University College London"}}}
