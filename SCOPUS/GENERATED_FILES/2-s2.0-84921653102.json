In this study we have simulated the self-assembly of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (C16TAC) surfactants at the Si(1 0 0)- and Si(1 1 1)-aqueous interfaces. The surfactants are found to form semicylindrical micelles on Si(1 0 0) but hemispherical micelles on Si(1 1 1). This difference in micelle structure is shown to be a consequence of the starkly different surface topographies that result from the reconstruction of the two silicon surfaces, and reveals that micelle structure can be governed by epitaxial matching even with non-polar substrates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ctac", "micelle", "self-assembly", "silicon", "topography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous interfaces", "ctac", "Hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride", "Mesostructured", "Micelle structure", "Silicon surfaces", "Soft template", "Solid-liquid interfaces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921653102", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"53063510000": {"Name": "Darkins R.", "AuthorID": "53063510000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101657971": {"Name": "Duffy D.", "AuthorID": "7101657971", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004634923": {"Name": "Sushko M.", "AuthorID": "7004634923", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}, "56407047400": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "56407047400", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}}}
