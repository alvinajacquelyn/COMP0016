The HMM describes the brain as a complex adaptive system that actively minimises the decay of our sensory and physical states by producing self-fulfilling action-perception cycles via dynamical interactions between hierarchically organised neurocognitive mechanisms. This theory synthesises the free-energy principle (FEP) in neuroscience with an evolutionary systems theory of psychology that explains our brains, minds, and behaviour by appealing to Tinbergen's four questions: adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism. After leveraging the FEP to formally define the HMM across different spatiotemporal scales, we conclude by exploring its implications for theorising and research in the sciences of the mind and behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active inference", "Evolutionary systems theory", "Free-energy principle", "Hierarchically mechanistic mind", "Neuroscience", "Psychology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active inference", "Energy principles", "Evolutionary system", "Hierarchically mechanistic mind", "Neuroscience", "Psychology", "Biological Evolution", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Neurosciences", "Psychology", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059641926", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"8788773200": {"Name": "Badcock P.B.", "AuthorID": "8788773200", "AffiliationID": "60003438", "AffiliationName": "Orygen, the National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "56986708800": {"Name": "Ramstead M.J.D.", "AuthorID": "56986708800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}}}
