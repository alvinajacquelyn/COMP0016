Cardiotoxic side effects limit their dosing and improved cancer outcomes expose the cancer survivor to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The basic mechanisms of cardiotoxicity may involve direct pathways for reactive oxygen species generation and topoisomerase 2 as well as other indirect pathways. Cardioprotective treatments are few and those that have been examined include renin angiotensin system blockade, beta blockers, or the iron chelator dexrazoxane. New treatments exploiting the ErbB or other novel pro-survival pathways, such as conditioning, are on the cardioprotection horizon. Even in the forthcoming era of targeted cancer therapies, the substantial proportion of today\u2019s anthracycline-treated cancer patients may become tomorrow\u2019s cardiac patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer anthracycline doxorubicin chemotherapy cardiotoxicity cardioprotection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anthracyclines", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Cardiotoxicity", "Cardiovascular Agents", "Cytoprotection", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Risk Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors", "Troponin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011903694", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193227260": {"Name": "McGowan J.", "AuthorID": "57193227260", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "8572078800": {"Name": "Chung R.", "AuthorID": "8572078800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "57086892700": {"Name": "Maulik A.", "AuthorID": "57086892700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "25947752800": {"Name": "Piotrowska I.", "AuthorID": "25947752800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "56611084900": {"Name": "Walker J.", "AuthorID": "56611084900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}}}
