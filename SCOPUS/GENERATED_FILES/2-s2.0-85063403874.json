Performing statistically convergent scans of high-dimensional BSM theories is consequently challenging, and in practice unfeasible for very high-dimensional BSM theories. We present here a new machine learning method that accelerates the interpretation of LHC data, by learning the relationship between BSM theory parameters and data. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this technique accurately predicts natural SUSY signal events in two signal regions at the High Luminosity LHC, up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard techniques. The new approach makes it possible to rapidly and accurately reconstruct the theory parameters of complex BSM theories, should an excess in the data be discovered at the LHC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063403874", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56251653400": {"Name": "Bertone G.", "AuthorID": "56251653400", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "GRAPPA, University of Amsterdam"}, "56818785000": {"Name": "Liem S.", "AuthorID": "56818785000", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "GRAPPA, University of Amsterdam"}, "24922891000": {"Name": "Deisenroth M.P.", "AuthorID": "24922891000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "57216273858": {"Name": "Kim J.S.", "AuthorID": "57216273858", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Theoretical Physics, School of Physics, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "26665282900": {"Name": "Austri R.R.d.", "AuthorID": "26665282900", "AffiliationID": "60013557, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica Corpuscular IFIC-UV/CSIC"}, "55907170700": {"Name": "Welling M.", "AuthorID": "55907170700", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam"}}}
