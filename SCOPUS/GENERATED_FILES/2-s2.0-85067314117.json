While quantitative research in the lab emphasizes the scientific rigor of hypothesis testing; qualitative research in the wild focuses on the understanding of the context of technologies in use, and each type of research has a correspondingly different kind of impact. This panel invites researchers with varied backgrounds to talk about the tensions and trade-offs between research in the lab and in the wild, with respect to scientific rigor, real-world relevance and impact. The goal is to enhance mutual understanding among researchers with diverse goals, values and practices within the CHI community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Impact", "Research in the lab", "Research in the wild", "Research methods", "Research paradigm", "Trade-off"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hypothesis testing", "Impact", "Interdisciplinary fields", "Multiple research", "Mutual understanding", "Qualitative research", "Quantitative research", "Trade off"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067314117", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55247039300": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "55247039300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7102699682": {"Name": "Mackay W.", "AuthorID": "7102699682", "AffiliationID": "60105988", "AffiliationName": "INRIA Saclay"}, "26967490300": {"Name": "Alavi H.", "AuthorID": "26967490300", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Fribourg"}, "55679986500": {"Name": "Zhai S.", "AuthorID": "55679986500", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Principal Scientist Google Inc."}, "22835289500": {"Name": "Moncur W.", "AuthorID": "22835289500", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "University of Dundee Dundee"}}}
