However, members of a jury also rely on non-verbal behaviours when judging the credibility of a witness, and this could determine the verdict of a case. We presented mock jurors with videos (from an experimental study) of one of two child witnesses on the autism spectrum being interviewed about a mock minor crime. Results demonstrated that providing jurors with generic information about autism and/or informing them of the child\u2019s diagnostic label differentially affected credibility ratings, but not for both children. Implications for how to present information about child witnesses with autism to a jury\u2014highlighting the need for approaches tailored to individual children\u2014are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Credibility", "Criminal justice", "Eyewitness memory", "Jury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Crime", "Criminal Law", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Judicial Role", "Male", "Mental Competency", "Middle Aged", "Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050745278", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"23766915000": {"Name": "Crane L.", "AuthorID": "23766915000", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Language and Communication Science, City, University of London"}, "8576959600": {"Name": "Wilcock R.", "AuthorID": "8576959600", "AffiliationID": "60003310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Winchester"}, "35746613400": {"Name": "Maras K.L.", "AuthorID": "35746613400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "57203153345": {"Name": "Chui W.", "AuthorID": "57203153345", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "57203161388": {"Name": "Marti-Sanchez C.", "AuthorID": "57203161388", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "7102224928": {"Name": "Henry L.A.", "AuthorID": "7102224928", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Language and Communication Science, City, University of London"}}}
