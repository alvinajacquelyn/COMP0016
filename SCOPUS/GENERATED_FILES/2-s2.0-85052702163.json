Data collection and biomarker analyses were conducted between 2015 and 2017. Associations were tested between blood concentrations of NfL and tau, and RTP time. Serum concentrations of S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were also measured for comparison.ResultsOf 288 players, 105 sustained an SRC. Of these, 87 underwent blood sampling 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours after SRC and at the RTP time point. Serum NfL concentrations 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours after SRC were related to prolonged RTP time, and could separate players with RTP >10 days from those with RTP \u226410 days (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.82). Also, serum NfL 144 hours after SRC discriminated players who resigned from the game due to persistent postconcussion symptoms (PCS) from those who returned to play (AUROC 0.89). Plasma tau 1 hour after SRC was related to RTP but less strongly than NfL, while S100B and NSE showed no such associations.ConclusionSerum NfL outperformed tau, S100B, and NSE as a biomarker for SRC. From a clinical standpoint, serum NfL may be useful to identify individuals at risk of prolonged PCS, and may aid in biomarker-informed decisions with regard to when RTP should be considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Athletic Injuries", "Brain Concussion", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hockey", "Humans", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Return to Sport", "S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit", "Severity of Illness Index", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "tau Proteins", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052702163", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55366129900": {"Name": "Shahim P.", "AuthorID": "55366129900", "AffiliationID": "60007183", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Sciences, Department of Health Sciences, Lule\u00e5 University of Technology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital M\u00f6lndal"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "120590429", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "56079025700": {"Name": "Tegner Y.", "AuthorID": "56079025700", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Lund University"}, "56001652300": {"Name": "Marklund N.", "AuthorID": "56001652300", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}}}
