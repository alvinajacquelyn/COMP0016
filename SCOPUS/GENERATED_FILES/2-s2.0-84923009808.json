Objective: Compare the effects of religiously integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (RCBT) and standard CBT (SCBT) on TA in adults with major depression and chronic medical illness. Method: Multi-site randomized controlled trial in 132 participants, of whom 108 (SCBT = 53, RCBT = 55) completed the Revised Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ-II) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Trajectory of change in scores over time was compared between groups. Results: HAQ-II score at 4 weeks predicted a decline in depressive symptoms over time independent of treatment group (B = \u22120.06, SE = 0.02, p = 0.002, n = 108). There was a marginally significant difference in HAQ-II scores at 4 weeks that favored RCBT (p = 0.076); however, the mixed effects model indicated a significant group by time interaction that favored the SCBT group (B = 1.84, SE = 0.90, degrees of freedom = 181, t = 2.04, p = 0.043, d = 0.30). Conclusions: While RCBT produces a marginally greater improvement in TA initially compared with SCBT, SCBT soon catches up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CBT", "chronic illness", "major depression", "psychotherapy", "religious", "spiritual", "therapeutic alliance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Chronic Disease", "Cognitive Therapy", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Religion and Psychology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923009808", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"26642890600": {"Name": "Koenig H.", "AuthorID": "26642890600", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7102484277": {"Name": "Pearce M.", "AuthorID": "7102484277", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Maryland"}, "7402428046": {"Name": "Nelson B.", "AuthorID": "7402428046", "AffiliationID": "100318670", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Glendale Adventist Medical Center"}, "56179067400": {"Name": "Shaw S.", "AuthorID": "56179067400", "AffiliationID": "100318670", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Glendale Adventist Medical Center"}, "7006544180": {"Name": "Robins C.", "AuthorID": "7006544180", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7004653266": {"Name": "Daher N.", "AuthorID": "7004653266", "AffiliationID": "60113483", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Population Medicine, School of Public Health, Loma Linda University"}, "57202975091": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "57202975091", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7403886623": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "7403886623", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
