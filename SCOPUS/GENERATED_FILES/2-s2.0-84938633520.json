Here, through a study of short model peptides in thioester formation and cyclisation reactions, we demonstrate that a wider variety of Xaa-Cys motifs than originally envisaged are capable of undergoing efficient N \u2192 S acyl transfer. We present data for the relative rates of thioester formation and cyclisation for a representative set of amino acids, and show how this expanded scope can be applied to the production of the natural protease inhibitor Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor-1 (SFTI-1).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acyl transfer", "Model peptides", "Peptide sequences", "Protease inhibitor", "Relative rates", "Sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1", "Thioesters", "Acylation", "Acylation", "Acylation", "Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Cyclization", "Cyclization", "Cyclization", "Cysteine", "Cysteine", "Cysteine", "Esters", "Esters", "Esters", "Mercaptoethanol", "Mercaptoethanol", "Mercaptoethanol", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nitrogen", "Nitrogen", "Nitrogen", "Peptides", "Peptides", "Peptides", "Peptides, Cyclic", "Peptides, Cyclic", "Peptides, Cyclic", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Sulfur", "Sulfur", "Sulfur"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938633520", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55214433800": {"Name": "Cowper B.", "AuthorID": "55214433800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "56235740200": {"Name": "Shariff L.", "AuthorID": "56235740200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "56763071900": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "56763071900", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "56763438800": {"Name": "Gibson S.M.", "AuthorID": "56763438800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "7003719640": {"Name": "Di W.L.", "AuthorID": "7003719640", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "15127363300": {"Name": "MacMillan D.", "AuthorID": "15127363300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}}}
