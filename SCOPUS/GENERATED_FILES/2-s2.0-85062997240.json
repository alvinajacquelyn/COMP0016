These viruses affect caudates, an order in which information regarding Ranavirus pathogenesis is scarce. In the Netherlands, two strains (CMTV-NL I and III) were suspected to possess distinct pathogenicity based on field data. To investigate susceptibility and disease progression in urodeles and determine differences in pathogenicity between strains, 45 adult smooth newts (Lissotriton vulgaris) were challenged via bath exposure with these ranaviruses and their detection in organs and feces followed over time by PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Ranavirus was first detected at 3 days post infection (p.i.) in the oral cavity and upper respiratory mucosa. At 6 days p.i, virus was found in connective tissues and vasculature of the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, from 9 days p.i onwards there was widespread Ranavirus disease in various organs including skin, kidneys and gonads. Higher pathogenicity of the CMTV-NL I strain was confirmed by higher correlation coefficient of experimental group and mortality of challenged animals. Ranavirus-exposed smooth newts shed virus in feces intermittently and infection was seen in the absence of lesions or clinical signs, indicating that this species can harbor subclinical infections and potentially serve as disease reservoirs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "DNA Virus Infections", "Feces", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Mouth", "Netherlands", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Ranavirus", "Salamandridae", "Virus Replication", "Virus Shedding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062997240", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189991155": {"Name": "Saucedo B.", "AuthorID": "57189991155", "AffiliationID": "108059539", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Wildlife Health Centre"}, "57201456006": {"Name": "Kruithof N.", "AuthorID": "57201456006", "AffiliationID": "108059539", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Wildlife Health Centre"}, "6603888703": {"Name": "Kik M.J.L.", "AuthorID": "6603888703", "AffiliationID": "108059539", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Wildlife Health Centre"}, "36060522500": {"Name": "van Beurden S.J.", "AuthorID": "36060522500", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University"}, "7003914139": {"Name": "Gr\u00f6ne A.", "AuthorID": "7003914139", "AffiliationID": "108059539", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Wildlife Health Centre"}, "7005973727": {"Name": "Garner T.W.J.", "AuthorID": "7005973727", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "57194419599": {"Name": "Sergeant C.", "AuthorID": "57194419599", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "57193386564": {"Name": "Allain S.J.R.", "AuthorID": "57193386564", "AffiliationID": "122263383", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Amphibian and Reptile Group"}, "57193393593": {"Name": "Goodman M.J.", "AuthorID": "57193393593", "AffiliationID": "122263383", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Amphibian and Reptile Group"}, "57207816368": {"Name": "Cranfield R.J.", "AuthorID": "57207816368", "AffiliationID": "122263396", "AffiliationName": "Essex Amphibian and Reptile Group"}, "57207831092": {"Name": "Vergara D.A.", "AuthorID": "57207831092", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "National Autonomous University of"}, "8614129700": {"Name": "Forz\u00e1n M.J.", "AuthorID": "8614129700", "AffiliationID": "60007776, 60021620", "AffiliationName": "Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine USA"}}}
