This release features a new discrete-time realization of the continuous-time robust exact differentiator. The implemented discretization scheme is less sensitive to gain overestimation and does not suffer from the discretization chattering effect. Hence, the single tuning parameter of the new version of the implemented differentiator is more intuitive to tune. Furthermore, it shows superior estimation performance in the case of large sampling times in comparison to the previous release. This is confirmed by the presented results obtained by numerical simulations and a real world application.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chattering effects", "Continuous-time", "Differentiators", "Discrete time realizations", "Discretization scheme", "Discretizations", "Estimation performance", "Tuning parameter"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054084527", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24830841200": {"Name": "Reichhartinger M.", "AuthorID": "24830841200", "AffiliationID": "60019663", "AffiliationName": "Graz University of Technology, Institute of Automation and Control"}, "57190489859": {"Name": "Koch S.", "AuthorID": "57190489859", "AffiliationID": "60019663, 60121828", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Automation and Control, Graz University of Technology, Christian Doppler Laboratory for Model Based Control of Complex Test Bed Systems"}, "57204018756": {"Name": "Niederwieser H.", "AuthorID": "57204018756", "AffiliationID": "60019663", "AffiliationName": "Information and Computer Engineering, Graz University of Technology"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic Electrical Engineering"}}}
