All rights reserved.Objectives Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterised by tissue fibrosis and vasculopathy with defective angiogenesis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) plays a major role in tissue fibrosis, including downregulation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1); however, its role in defective angiogenesis is less clear. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a major antiangiogenic factor, is abundantly secreted by SSc fibroblasts. Here, we investigated the effect of TGF-\u03b2and Cav-1 on PEDF expression and the role of PEDF in the ability of SSc fibroblasts to modulate angiogenesis. Methods P EDF and Cav-1 expression in fibroblasts and endothelial cells were evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry on human and mouse skin biopsies. PEDF and Cav-1 were silenced in cultured SSc and control fibroblasts using lentiviral short-hairpin RNAs. Organotypic fibroblast-endothelial cell cocultures and matrigel assays were employed to assess angiogenesis. Results P EDF is highly expressed in myofibroblasts and reticular fibroblasts with low Cav-1 expression in SSc skin biopsies, and it is induced by TGF-\u03b2in vitro. SSc fibroblasts suppress angiogenesis in an organotypic model. This model is reproduced by silencing Cav-1 in normal dermal fibroblasts. Conversely, silencing PEDF in SSc fibroblasts rescues their antiangiogenic phenotype. Consistently, transgenic mice with TGF-\u03b2 receptor hyperactivation show lower Cav-1 and higher PEDF expression levels in skin biopsies accompanied by reduced blood vessel density. Conclusions O ur data reveal a new pathway by which TGF-\u03b2suppresses angiogenesis in SSc, through decreased fibroblast Cav-1 expression and subsequent PEDF secretion. This pathway may present a promising target for new therapeutic interventions in SSc.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caveolin 1", "Cells, Cultured", "Endothelial Cells", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Serpins", "Skin", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044958891", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"11738825500": {"Name": "Liakouli V.", "AuthorID": "11738825500", "AffiliationID": "60018783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Science, Rheumatology Unit, School of Medicine, University of L'Aquila"}, "8600100000": {"Name": "Elies J.", "AuthorID": "8600100000", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of Bradford"}, "6508271093": {"Name": "El-Sherbiny Y.M.", "AuthorID": "6508271093", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "26031269600": {"Name": "Abignano G.", "AuthorID": "26031269600", "AffiliationID": "60086662", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Institute of Lucania (IReL), San Carlo Hospital of Potenza"}, "7201777137": {"Name": "Emery P.", "AuthorID": "7201777137", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57202944561": {"Name": "Del Galdo F.", "AuthorID": "57202944561", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7005841263": {"Name": "Cipriani P.", "AuthorID": "7005841263", "AffiliationID": "60018783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Science, Rheumatology Unit, School of Medicine, University of L'Aquila"}, "7005727544": {"Name": "Giacomelli R.", "AuthorID": "7005727544", "AffiliationID": "60018783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Science, Rheumatology Unit, School of Medicine, University of L'Aquila"}, "37099099400": {"Name": "Scarcia M.", "AuthorID": "37099099400", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Signal Transduction and Tumour Microenvironment Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "56709253700": {"Name": "Grant G.", "AuthorID": "56709253700", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Signal Transduction and Tumour Microenvironment Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "6506192192": {"Name": "Mavria G.", "AuthorID": "6506192192", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Signal Transduction and Tumour Microenvironment Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "23975555700": {"Name": "Derrett-Smith E.C.", "AuthorID": "23975555700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue, UCL Medical School Royal Free Campus"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue, UCL Medical School Royal Free Campus"}, "56709365400": {"Name": "Esteves F.", "AuthorID": "56709365400", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}}}
