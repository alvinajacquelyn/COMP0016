In this study, we aimed to test the effect of audio-visual temporal coherence alone on selective listening, free of linguistic confounds. We presented listeners with competing auditory streams whose amplitude varied independently and a visual stimulus with varying radius, while manipulating the cross-modal temporal relationships. Performance improved when the auditory target's timecourse matched that of the visual stimulus. The fact that the coherence was between task-irrelevant stimulus features suggests that the observed improvement stemmed from the integration of auditory and visual streams into cross-modal objects, enabling listeners to better attend the target. These findings suggest that in everyday conditions, where listeners can often see the source of a sound, temporal cues provided by vision can help listeners to select one sound source from a mixture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["auditory scene analysis", "auditory-visual integration", "human", "multisensory", "neuroscience", "selective attention", "temporal coherence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Photic Stimulation", "Pitch Discrimination", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044695717", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24462157400": {"Name": "Maddox R.K.", "AuthorID": "24462157400", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences, University of Washington"}, "56518093100": {"Name": "Atilgan H.", "AuthorID": "56518093100", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences, University of Washington"}, "6508140931": {"Name": "Bizley J.K.", "AuthorID": "6508140931", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences, University of Washington"}, "35484356000": {"Name": "Lee A.K.C.", "AuthorID": "35484356000", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences, University of Washington"}}}
