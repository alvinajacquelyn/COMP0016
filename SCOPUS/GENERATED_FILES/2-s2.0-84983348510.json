We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore network-level explanations for how the form and motion information in dynamic facial expressions might be combined in the human STS. Ventral occipitotemporal areas selective for facial form were localized in occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA and FFA), and motion sensitivity was localized in the more dorsal temporal area V5. We then tested various connectivity models that modeled communication between the ventral form and dorsal motion pathways. We show that facial form information modulated transmission of motion information from V5 to the STS, and that this face-selective modulation likely originated in OFA. This finding shows that form-selective motion sensitivity in the STS can be explained in terms of modulation of gain control on information flow in the motion pathway, and provides a substantial constraint for theories of the perception of faces and biological motion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological motion", "Dynamic causal modeling", "Face perception", "Functional magnetic resonance imaging", "Superior temporal sulcus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Brain Mapping", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Nerve Net", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Oxygen", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Photic Stimulation", "Probability", "Temporal Lobe", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983348510", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"22955383400": {"Name": "Furl N.", "AuthorID": "22955383400", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "7006433689": {"Name": "Henson R.", "AuthorID": "7006433689", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "7102367257": {"Name": "Calder A.", "AuthorID": "7102367257", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Imaging Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
