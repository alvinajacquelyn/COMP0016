Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Zoological Society of London.The loss of huge areas of peat swamp forest in Southeast Asia and the resulting negative environmental effects, both local and global, have led to an increasing interest in peat restoration in the region. Satellite remote sensing offers the potential to provide up-to-date information on peat swamp forest loss across large areas, and support spatial explicit conservation and restoration planning. Fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data may be particularly valuable in this context, as most peat swamp forests are in areas with high cloud cover, which limits the use of optical data. Radar data can \u2018see through\u2019 cloud, but experience so far has shown that it doesn't discriminate well between certain types of land cover. Various approaches to fusion exist, but there is little information on how they compare. To assess this untapped potential, we compare three different classification methods with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map the remnant distribution of peat swamp forest in the area surrounding Sungai Buluh Protection Forest, Sumatra, Indonesia. Results show that data fusion increases overall accuracy in one of the three methods, compared to the use of optical data only. When data fusion was used with the pixel-based classification using the original pixel values, overall accuracy increased by a small, but statistically significant amount. Data fusion was not beneficial in the case of object-based classification or pixel-based classification using principal components. This indicates optical data are still the main source of information for land cover mapping in the region. Based on our findings, we provide methodological recommendations to help those involved in peatland restoration capitalize on the potential of big data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deforestation", "land cover", "peat swamp forest", "restoration", "satellite data fusion", "tropical peatland"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058192383", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"57204965251": {"Name": "Crowson M.", "AuthorID": "57204965251", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park"}, "56296891800": {"Name": "Warren-Thomas E.", "AuthorID": "56296891800", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "54792020400": {"Name": "Hill J.K.", "AuthorID": "54792020400", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "54388032300": {"Name": "Lucey J.", "AuthorID": "54388032300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "55144054700": {"Name": "Hariyadi B.", "AuthorID": "55144054700", "AffiliationID": "100464155", "AffiliationName": "Biology Education Program, Faculty of Education and Teacher Training, Jambi University"}, "57204962007": {"Name": "Kartika W.D.", "AuthorID": "57204962007", "AffiliationID": "100464155", "AffiliationName": "Biology Education Program, Faculty of Education and Teacher Training, Jambi University"}, "55933424800": {"Name": "Agus F.", "AuthorID": "55933424800", "AffiliationID": "60087553", "AffiliationName": "Indonesian Soil Research Institute, Indonesian Center for Agricultural Land Resources Research and Development"}, "56685751000": {"Name": "Nurida N.L.", "AuthorID": "56685751000", "AffiliationID": "60087553", "AffiliationName": "Indonesian Soil Research Institute, Indonesian Center for Agricultural Land Resources Research and Development"}, "57204959313": {"Name": "Pratiwi E.", "AuthorID": "57204959313", "AffiliationID": "60087553", "AffiliationName": "Indonesian Soil Research Institute, Indonesian Center for Agricultural Land Resources Research and Development"}, "56970634900": {"Name": "Saad A.", "AuthorID": "56970634900", "AffiliationID": "100464155", "AffiliationName": "Soil Science Division, Faculty of Agriculture, Jambi University"}, "35569772500": {"Name": "Hamer K.C.", "AuthorID": "35569772500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "26653477500": {"Name": "Hodgson J.A.", "AuthorID": "26653477500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool"}, "6603564901": {"Name": "McClean C.", "AuthorID": "6603564901", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Environment Department, University of York"}, "14018839600": {"Name": "Stringer L.C.", "AuthorID": "14018839600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57195246323": {"Name": "Ward C.", "AuthorID": "57195246323", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}}}
