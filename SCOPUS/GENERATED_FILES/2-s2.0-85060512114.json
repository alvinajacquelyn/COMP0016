Visible lesions arising in BE need endoscopic mucosal resection for accurate staging and removal. Resection modalities include a cap-based system with snare and custom-made multiband mucosectomy (MBM) devices (Duette, Cook Medical Ltd). A new MBM device has recently become available (Captivator, Boston Scientific Ltd). Objectives: A retrospective pilot study to compare the efficacy, safety, specimen size and histology of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) specimens resected with two MBM devices (Cook Duette and Boston Captivator) in treatment naive patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for BE neoplasia. Methods: Consecutive EMR procedures carried out by a single experienced endoscopist were analysed. All visible lesions were marked and resected using one of the two MBM devices. All resected specimens were analysed by the same two experienced pathologists. The resected specimens in both groups were analysed for maximum diameter, minimum diameter, surface area and depth. Results: Twenty consecutive patients were analysed (18M + 2F; mean age 74) in the Duette group and 20 (17M + 3F; mean age 72) in the Captivator group. A total of 58 specimens were resected in the Duette and 63 in the Captivator group. Min diameter, max diameter, surface area and depth of the ER specimens resected by the Captivator device were significantly larger than that by the Duette device [min diameter 9.89 mm vs 9.07 mm (p = 0.019); max diameter: 13.54 mm vs 12.38 mm (p = 0.024); surface area: 135.40 mm2 vs 113.89 mm2 (p = 0.005); depth 3.71 mm vs 2.89 (p = 0.001)]. Conclusions: These two MBM devices showed equivalent efficacy and safety outcomes, but the EMR Captivator device resected specimens with a larger area in the esophagus when compared with the Duette device. A possible advantage of this is in situations where en bloc resections with fewer EMRs are desirable for larger lesions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrett\u2019s esophagus (BE)", "Endoscopic mucosal resection", "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)", "Multiband mucosectomy (MBM)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Aged", "Barrett Esophagus", "Endoscopic Mucosal Resection", "Equipment Design", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophagoscopy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pilot Projects", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060512114", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"35747755100": {"Name": "Alzoubaidi D.", "AuthorID": "35747755100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203948405": {"Name": "Lovat L.B.", "AuthorID": "57203948405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "37120187600": {"Name": "Haidry R.", "AuthorID": "37120187600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56358375900": {"Name": "Graham D.", "AuthorID": "56358375900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204595868": {"Name": "Magee C.", "AuthorID": "57204595868", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201395889": {"Name": "Everson M.", "AuthorID": "57201395889", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102259849": {"Name": "Banks M.", "AuthorID": "7102259849", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56672533700": {"Name": "Novelli M.", "AuthorID": "56672533700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220668112": {"Name": "Jansen M.", "AuthorID": "57220668112", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8725282000": {"Name": "Bassett P.", "AuthorID": "8725282000", "AffiliationID": "112710538", "AffiliationName": "Statsconsultancy Ltd"}}}
