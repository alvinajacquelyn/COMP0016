All rights reserved.This paper examines the characteristics of the collaborations between inventors in the United Kingdom (UK) by looking at what types of proximities - geographic, organisational, cognitive, social, and cultural-ethnic - between inventors are prevalent in partnerships that ultimately lead to technological progress. Using a new panel of UK inventors this paper provides an analysis of associations between these 'proximities' and co-patenting. The results show that while collaboration within firms, research centres and universities remains crucial, external networks of inventors are key feature of innovation teams. The analysis shows that external networks are highly dependent on previous social connections, but are generally unconstrained by cultural or cognitive factors. Geographical proximity is also weakly linked with external networks. Our results suggest that innovation policies should, rather than focus on spatial clustering, facilitate the formation of open and diverse networks of inventors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["JEL classification O31", "O33", "R11", "R23"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive factors", "Collaborative knowledge creation", "Geographical proximity", "Innovation policies", "JEL classification O31", "Social connection", "Spatial clustering", "Technological progress"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961813418", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"22933459700": {"Name": "Crescenzi R.", "AuthorID": "22933459700", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "SERC, London School of Economics"}, "35607241500": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Pose A.", "AuthorID": "35607241500", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "SERC, London School of Economics"}, "14822490100": {"Name": "Nathan M.", "AuthorID": "14822490100", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60172646", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham"}}}
