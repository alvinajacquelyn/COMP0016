The embryonic mouse hindbrain provides an excellent model to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of angiogenesis in vivo due the simple geometry of the hindbrain vasculature and its easy accessibility for fluorescent or histochemical staining, and for image capture and quantitation. This chapter outlines protocols for dissection, staining, and analysis of the mouse embryo hindbrain vasculature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Development", "Hindbrain", "Mouse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dissection", "Female", "Mice", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Pregnancy", "Rhombencephalon", "Staining and Labeling", "Tamoxifen", "Tissue Fixation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955343970", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55578918400": {"Name": "Plein A.", "AuthorID": "55578918400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "23007969000": {"Name": "Fantin A.", "AuthorID": "23007969000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
