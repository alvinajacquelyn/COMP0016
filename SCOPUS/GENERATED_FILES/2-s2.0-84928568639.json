An \u03b1-Kuramoto partition is a graph partition induced by the Kuramoto model, when the oscillators include a phase frustration parameter. We prove that every equitable partition is an \u03b1-Kuramoto partition, but that the converse does necessarily not hold. We give an exact characterisation of \u03b1-Kuramoto bipartitions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graph partitions", "Kuramoto model", "Phase synchronisation", "Systems of differential equations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928568639", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"35582480800": {"Name": "Kirkland S.", "AuthorID": "35582480800", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Manitoba"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
