Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Podosomes are integrin-containing adhesion structures commonly found in migrating leukocytes of the monocytic lineage. The actin cytoskeletal organisation of podosomes is based on a WASP-and Arp2/3-mediated mechanism. WASP also associates with a second protein, WIP (also known as WIPF1), and they co-localise in podosome cores. Here, we report for the first time that WIP can be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and that tyrosine phosphorylation of WIP is a trigger for release of WASP from the WIP-WASP complex. Using a knockdown approach together with expression of WIP phosphomimics, we show that in the absence of WIP-WASP binding, cellular WASP is rapidly degraded, leading to disruption of podosomes and a failure of cells to degrade an underlying matrix. In the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, the WIP-WASP complex remains intact and podosome lifetimes are extended. A screen of candidate kinases and inhibitor-based assays identified Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) as a regulator of WIP tyrosine phosphorylation. We conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of WIP is a crucial regulator of WASP stability and function as an actin-nucleation-promoting factor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin cytoskeleton", "Macrophages", "Matrix degradation", "Podosome", "Tyrosine phosphorylation", "WIP", "WIPF1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Animals", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Extracellular Matrix", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Macrophages", "Phosphorylation", "Podosomes", "Protein Binding", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Tyrosine", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921342057", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55914628100": {"Name": "Vijayakumar V.", "AuthorID": "55914628100", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "6507185449": {"Name": "Monypenny J.", "AuthorID": "6507185449", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "56404828800": {"Name": "Chen X.J.", "AuthorID": "56404828800", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "55314655700": {"Name": "Jones G.E.", "AuthorID": "55314655700", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London"}, "7006454225": {"Name": "Machesky L.M.", "AuthorID": "7006454225", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Beatson Institute for Cancer Research"}, "56615615300": {"Name": "Lilla S.", "AuthorID": "56615615300", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Beatson Institute for Cancer Research"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Section of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005345509": {"Name": "Ant\u00f3n I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005345509", "AffiliationID": "60018678, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda (CNB-CSIC)"}, "6603303636": {"Name": "Calle Y.", "AuthorID": "6603303636", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, University of Roehampton"}}}
