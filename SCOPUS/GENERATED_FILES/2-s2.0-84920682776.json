It considers the role of cinema in the context of Walkers everyday life, and uses his diary to reconstruct a snapshot of the contemporary entertainment landscape of Londons West End. It then situates cinema in relation to two other West End leisure venues that Walker frequented: the variety theatre and the gentlemens club.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cinema-going", "diaries", "First World War", "gentlemen's clubs", "London", "variety theatre"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920682776", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"56472780500": {"Name": "Orourke C.", "AuthorID": "56472780500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Arts, University College London"}}}
