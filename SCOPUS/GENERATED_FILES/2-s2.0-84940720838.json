However, despite considerable efforts in sequential or combined modalities, durable remissions are rare. Immunotherapy like cytokine therapy with interleukin-2, T cell checkpoint blockade or adoptive T cell therapies can achieve long-term benefit and even cure. This raises the question of whether combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy could also be an effective treatment option for RCC patients. Sunitinib, one of the most frequently administered therapeutics in RCC patients has been implicated in impairing T cell activation and proliferation in vitro. In this work, we addressed whether this notion holds true for expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in sunitinib-treated patients. We compared resected primary RCC tumor material of patients pretreated with sunitinib with resection specimen from sunitinib-na\u00efve patients. We found improved TIL expansion from sunitinib-pretreated tumor digests. These TIL products contained more PD-1 expressing TIL, while the regulatory T cell infiltration was not altered. The improved TIL expansion was associated with reduced intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) content. Depletion of MDSCs from sunitinib-na\u00efve RCC tissue-digest improved TIL expansion, proving the functional relevance of the MDSC alteration by sunitinib. Our in vivo results do not support previous in vitro observations of sunitinib inhibiting T cell function, but do provide a possible rationale for the combination of sunitinib with immunotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adoptive cell therapy", "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells", "Renal cell carcinoma", "Sunitinib", "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Indoles", "Interleukin-2", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Myeloid Cells", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor", "Pyrimidines", "Pyrroles", "Sirolimus", "Sulfonamides", "T-Lymphocytes", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940720838", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"54890003200": {"Name": "Guislain A.", "AuthorID": "54890003200", "AffiliationID": "60027673", "AffiliationName": "Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation"}, "34869507700": {"Name": "Gadiot J.", "AuthorID": "34869507700", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "13006002400": {"Name": "Kaiser A.", "AuthorID": "13006002400", "AffiliationID": "60074947", "AffiliationName": "Miltenyi Biotec"}, "6602742331": {"Name": "Jordanova E.", "AuthorID": "6602742331", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Core Facility Molecular Pathology and Biobanking, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "7003526080": {"Name": "Haanen J.", "AuthorID": "7003526080", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "7007139510": {"Name": "Blank C.", "AuthorID": "7007139510", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "57201916750": {"Name": "Broeks A.", "AuthorID": "57201916750", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Core Facility Molecular Pathology and Biobanking, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "57214131067": {"Name": "Sanders J.", "AuthorID": "57214131067", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "6602418621": {"Name": "van Boven H.", "AuthorID": "6602418621", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}, "6701507405": {"Name": "de Gruijl T.", "AuthorID": "6701507405", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Free University Medical Center (VUMC)"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)"}}}
