In particular, the workshop will focus on the rediscovery of the human senses, either alone or in a multimodal combination, and of the perceptual-motor abilities of our body. The one-day workshop is divided in three steps: first phase is for the generation of ideas on multisensory interfaces, in the second phase, participants will have the possibilities to explore and rediscover their sensorimotor abilities through several exercises and games; in the third and last phase, there will be a further creative session in order to evaluate how the full body and multisensory activities have fostered people's creative processes. The aim of the whole experience is twofold: first, inspiring participants in designing novel concepts for multisensory interfaces; second, providing a preliminary study on the effect of these exercises in fostering creativity and supporting the design process of multisensory interfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body-Centered Design.", "Full-Body Interaction", "Multimodality", "Multisensory Experience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Creative process", "Design process", "Full-body interaction", "Motor abilities", "Multi-modality", "Multi-sensory interfaces", "Multisensory", "Novel concept"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991109603", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"36163969400": {"Name": "Caon M.", "AuthorID": "36163969400", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland"}, "36163906600": {"Name": "Angelini L.", "AuthorID": "36163906600", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland"}, "8987147000": {"Name": "Mugellini E.", "AuthorID": "8987147000", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland"}, "55877170000": {"Name": "Matassa A.", "AuthorID": "55877170000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57199212151": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57199212151", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Loyola Andalucia"}}}
