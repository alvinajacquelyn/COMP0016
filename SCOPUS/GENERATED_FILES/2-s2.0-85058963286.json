Methods: We applied the results from the published MRC Child\u2013Parent Screening Study to 10,000 children, together with cascade testing first degree relatives of parents with a familial hypercholesterolaemia mutation identified by child\u2013parent screening. We estimated the number of familial hypercholesterolaemia cases identified per child screened, the median cost per familial hypercholesterolaemia case identified and the median cost per child screened to identify one case using a range of cholesterol and familial hypercholesterolaemia mutation testing costs. We present a case study to illustrate the application of CPCS in practice. Results: CPCS identifies one new familial hypercholesterolaemia case per 70 children screened at a median estimated cost of \u00a3960 per new familial hypercholesterolaemia case or \u00a34 per child screened. CPCS identifies an average of four new familial hypercholesterolaemia cases per family. In the case study, six new familial hypercholesterolaemia cases were identified, and preventive treatment started in five, with the index child expected to start when older. Conclusion: CPCS for familial hypercholesterolaemia are complementary strategies. The sustainability of cascade testing relies on identifying new unrelated index cases. This is achieved with population-wide child\u2013parent screening. Integrated CPCS is currently better than either method of familial hypercholesterolaemia detection alone. It has the potential to identify all, or nearly all, individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia in the population at low cost.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cascade", "child\u2013parent", "Familial hypercholesterolaemia", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cholesterol", "Cholesterol, LDL", "England", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II", "Infant", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Mutation", "Parents", "Pedigree", "Receptors, LDL"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058963286", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7005483943": {"Name": "Wald D.S.", "AuthorID": "7005483943", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203046820": {"Name": "Wald N.J.", "AuthorID": "57203046820", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
