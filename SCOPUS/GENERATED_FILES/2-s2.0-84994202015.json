Motivated by this need, a next-generation integrated bridge inspection system named SeeBridge is proposed. To frame the system, an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) was compiled to specify the technical components, activities and information exchanges in the SeeBridge process. The IDM supports development of the system by rigorously defining the information and data repositories that structure bridge engineers' knowledge. The SeeBridge process is mapped, parts of the data repositories are presented and the future use of the IDM is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bridge inspection", "Building Information Modelling", "Information Delivery Manual", "Remote sensing", "Semantic enrichment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bridge inspection", "Building Information Modelling", "Data repositories", "Information delivery", "Information exchanges", "Innovative solutions", "Integrated bridges", "Semantic enrichment"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994202015", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"7102941790": {"Name": "Sacks R.", "AuthorID": "7102941790", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering., Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57191869466": {"Name": "Kedar A.", "AuthorID": "57191869466", "AffiliationID": "117632538", "AffiliationName": "Kedmor Engineers"}, "14824718700": {"Name": "Borrmann A.", "AuthorID": "14824718700", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computational Modeling and Simulation, Technical University Munich"}, "57191172864": {"Name": "Singer D.", "AuthorID": "57191172864", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computational Modeling and Simulation, Technical University Munich"}, "57191856996": {"Name": "Kattel U.", "AuthorID": "57191856996", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computational Modeling and Simulation, Technical University Munich"}, "55720988200": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "55720988200", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "National Building Research Institute, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"}}}
