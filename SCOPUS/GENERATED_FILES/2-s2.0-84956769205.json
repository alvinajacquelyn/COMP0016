In adults, it is less well recognised, although epidemiological data suggests VZV increases stroke risk acutely by 127 % in the first 2 weeks, and by 17 % between 2 weeks and 1 year after viral symptoms. CSF pleocytosis is not required to diagnose VZV vasculopathy and only approximately 30 % of cases have CSF VZV DNA detected. This case of a 31 year old male with left upper limb sensory disturbance and headache 7 months after right trigeminal herpes zoster ophthalmicus demonstrates the challenges of diagnosis and treatment of large vessel vasculopathy. The case shows that VZV vasculopathy should be considered in patients with unexplained vasculopathy or cryptogenic stroke, especially if there is a recent history of herpes zoster infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Pleocytosis", "Shingles", "Stroke", "Varicella zoster", "Vasculopathy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956769205", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57091548000": {"Name": "\u00c1ine M.", "AuthorID": "57091548000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57074506500": {"Name": "Blair L.", "AuthorID": "57074506500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Hyper Acute Stroke Unit, University College Hospital"}, "7006192808": {"Name": "Ginsberg L.", "AuthorID": "7006192808", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603142203": {"Name": "Simister R.", "AuthorID": "6603142203", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, National Hospital for Neurologyand Neurosurgery"}}}
