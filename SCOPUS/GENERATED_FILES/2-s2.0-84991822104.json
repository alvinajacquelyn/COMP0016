A multilayer ellipsoidal condenser is used to focus and spectrally narrow the radiation from the plasma, producing a quasi-monochromatic EUV radiation (\u03bb = 13.8 nm) illuminating the object, whereas a Fresnel zone plate objective forms the image. Design details, development, characterization and optimization of the EUV source and the microscope are described and discussed. Test object and other samples were imaged to demonstrate superior resolution compared to visible light microscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EUV microscopy", "EUV source", "Fresnel zone plate", "gas-puff target", "imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991822104", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"56519604100": {"Name": "Torrisi A.", "AuthorID": "56519604100", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "15045938800": {"Name": "Wachulak P.", "AuthorID": "15045938800", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55579284700": {"Name": "W\u0118grzy\u0143ski \u0141.", "AuthorID": "55579284700", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55578939000": {"Name": "Fok T.", "AuthorID": "55578939000", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "7003336293": {"Name": "Bartnik A.", "AuthorID": "7003336293", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "57209098906": {"Name": "Jankiewicz B.", "AuthorID": "57209098906", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55780695400": {"Name": "Bartosewicz B.", "AuthorID": "55780695400", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "7004495078": {"Name": "Fiedorowicz H.", "AuthorID": "7004495078", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "56989869400": {"Name": "Parkman T.", "AuthorID": "56989869400", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "56845598000": {"Name": "Vondrov\u00c1 \u0160.", "AuthorID": "56845598000", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "56845643000": {"Name": "Tur\u0147ov\u00c1 J.", "AuthorID": "56845643000", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}}}
