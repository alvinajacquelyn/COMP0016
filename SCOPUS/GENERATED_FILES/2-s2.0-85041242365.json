We sought to challenge a nationalist version of citizenship education by proposing \u201ceducation for cosmopolitan citizenship\u201d arguing for citizenship learning founded in human rights, that recognises and builds upon cosmopolitan values at all scales. Building upon David Held\u2019s theories of cosmopolitan democracy we examined research data from young people living in communities characterised by diversity. We characterised them as emergent cosmopolitan citizens, who were negotiating daily their multiple loyalties and belongings. Nearly two decades later, many people are less optimistic about the global political climate. In the face of economic difficulties, demographic change and uncertainties, some welcome authoritarian and populist leaders whose rhetoric suggests easy solutions to complex problems, blaming the most vulnerable (e.g. refugees, foreigners) for society\u2019s ills. A politics of solidarity and hope is derided as those who have suffered the negative impact of globalisation, economic crisis and austerity policies are urged to put \u201cour people\u201d first. This paper examines various challenges confronting teachers who seek to educate young people for living together in democratic communities in which human rights, justice and peace prevail. We argue that education for human rights and cosmopolitan citizenship is more urgent than ever. Such an education can offer young people alternative narratives, empowering them to struggle for justice in their own lives and those of others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmopolitan citizenship", "Human rights education", "Islamophobia", "migration", "nationalism", "populism", "social justice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041242365", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7005322252": {"Name": "Osler A.", "AuthorID": "7005322252", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "6701315914": {"Name": "Starkey H.", "AuthorID": "6701315914", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
