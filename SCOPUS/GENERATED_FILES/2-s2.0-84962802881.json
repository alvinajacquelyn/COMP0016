However, many challenges still exist in using these methods for knowledge discovery within this field given that the large amounts of data medical practitioners collect often creates a curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, attribute selection approaches have been developed. However, current approaches typically put equal weight on all values within that attribute. At times, and especially within medical domains, we claim that these approaches might miss attributes where only a small subset of attribute values contain a strong indication for one of the target values and thus should still be selected. To quantify this approach, we present MIAT, an algorithm that defines Minority Interesting Attribute Thresholds to find these important attribute values. As we developed MIAT to help better diagnose upper gastrointestinal cancer, we present how we use the attributes selected through this approach to build a predictive model for this cancer. To demonstrate MIAT's generality, we also applied it to a canonical Hungarian Heart Disease Dataset. In both datasets we found that MIAT yields significantly better accuracy and sensitivity over traditional attribute selection approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attribute selection", "Attribute values", "Curse of dimensionality", "Large amounts of data", "Medical domains", "Medical practitioner", "Predictive modeling", "Upper gastrointestinal"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962802881", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"57218769912": {"Name": "Rosenfeld A.", "AuthorID": "57218769912", "AffiliationID": "60027414", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering, Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT)"}, "56358375900": {"Name": "Graham D.G.", "AuthorID": "56358375900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital (UCLH)"}, "56215811100": {"Name": "Butawan R.", "AuthorID": "56215811100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital (UCLH)"}, "54890754800": {"Name": "Eneh V.", "AuthorID": "54890754800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital (UCLH)"}, "7801449420": {"Name": "Miah H.", "AuthorID": "7801449420", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital (UCLH)"}, "57203948405": {"Name": "Lovat L.B.", "AuthorID": "57203948405", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital (UCLH)"}, "7003699541": {"Name": "Hamoudi R.", "AuthorID": "7003699541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57221016280": {"Name": "Khan S.", "AuthorID": "57221016280", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57205698392": {"Name": "Niranjan M.", "AuthorID": "57205698392", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Southampton University"}}}
