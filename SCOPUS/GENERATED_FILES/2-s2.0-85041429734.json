Our device is composed of three active layers: a Si(Li) detector as a scatterer and two high purity Germanium detectors as absorbers of high-energy gamma rays. We performed Monte Carlo simulations using the Geant4 toolkit to characterise the expected gamma field during proton beam therapy and have made experimental measurements of the gamma spectrum with a 60 MeV passive scattering beam irradiating a phantom. In this proceeding, we describe the status of the Compton camera and present the first preliminary measurements with radioactive sources and their corresponding reconstructed images.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compton imaging", "Gamma detectors (scintillators, CZT, HPG, HgI etc)", "Instrumentation for hadron therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compton imaging", "Dose verification", "Gamma detectors", "Hadron therapy", "High energy gamma rays", "High purity germanium detectors", "Radioactive sources", "Reconstructed image"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041429734", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57211875186": {"Name": "Gutierrez A.", "AuthorID": "57211875186", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57199995461": {"Name": "Chung S.", "AuthorID": "57199995461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "14036021200": {"Name": "Moss R.", "AuthorID": "14036021200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005472272": {"Name": "Royle G.", "AuthorID": "7005472272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205908360": {"Name": "Speller R.", "AuthorID": "57205908360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55418224900": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "55418224900", "AffiliationID": "60026941", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Department, Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16027819300": {"Name": "Boston H.", "AuthorID": "16027819300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "8960465400": {"Name": "Judson D.S.", "AuthorID": "8960465400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "56161917300": {"Name": "Crom B.L.", "AuthorID": "56161917300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "7003534096": {"Name": "Boston A.J.", "AuthorID": "7003534096", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "12760112000": {"Name": "Kacperek A.", "AuthorID": "12760112000", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "National Eye Proton Therapy Centre, Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
