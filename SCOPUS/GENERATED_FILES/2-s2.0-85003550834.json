New therapeutic targets are urgently needed to improve patient survival rates. Objective: The proto-oncogene PTTG1-binding factor (PBF/PTTG1IP) is overexpressed in multiple endocrine cancers and circumstantially associated with tumor aggressiveness. This study aimed to understand the role of PBF in tumor cell invasion and identify possible routes to inhibit its action. Design, Setting, Patients, and Interventions: Thyroid, breast, and colorectal cells were transfected with PBF and cultured for in vitro analysis. PBF and cortactin (CTTN) expression was determined in differentiated thyroid cancer and The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-seq data. Primary Outcome Measure: Pro-invasive effects of PBF were evaluated by 2D Boyden chamber, 3D organotypic, and proximity ligation assays. Results: Our study identified that PBF and CTTN physically interact and co-localize, and that this occurs at the cell periphery, particularly at the leading edge of migrating cancer cells. Critically, PBF induces potent cellular invasion and migration in thyroid and breast cancer cells, which is entirely abrogated in the absence of CTTN. Importantly, we found that CTTN is over-expressed in differentiated thyroid cancer, particularly in patients with regional lymph node metastasis, which significantly correlates with elevated PBF expression. Mutation of PBF (Y174A) or pharmacological intervention modulates the PBF: CTTN interaction and attenuates the invasive properties of cancer cells. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a unique role for PBF in regulating CTTN function to promote endocrine cell invasion and migration, as well as identify a new targetable interaction to block tumor cell movement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Cortactin", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Thyroid Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003550834", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"55046597100": {"Name": "Watkins R.J.", "AuthorID": "55046597100", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55252833800": {"Name": "Imruetaicharoenchoke W.", "AuthorID": "55252833800", "AffiliationID": "60011189, 60012718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"}, "7202794809": {"Name": "Read M.L.", "AuthorID": "7202794809", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55798101233": {"Name": "Sharma N.", "AuthorID": "55798101233", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55904351600": {"Name": "Poole V.L.", "AuthorID": "55904351600", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57054979500": {"Name": "Bansal S.", "AuthorID": "57054979500", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57192303652": {"Name": "Fletcher R.", "AuthorID": "57192303652", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57191966509": {"Name": "Nieto H.R.", "AuthorID": "57191966509", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "9036310600": {"Name": "Boelaert K.", "AuthorID": "9036310600", "AffiliationID": "60032653, 60196675", "AffiliationName": "STIM Laboratory, University of Poitiers"}, "55435409800": {"Name": "Smith V.E.", "AuthorID": "55435409800", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7101648664": {"Name": "McCabe C.J.", "AuthorID": "7101648664", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "36166760400": {"Name": "Gentilin E.", "AuthorID": "36166760400", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Section of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, University of Ferrara"}, "56771384300": {"Name": "Bosseboeuf E.", "AuthorID": "56771384300", "AffiliationID": "60032653, 60196675", "AffiliationName": "STIM Laboratory, University of Poitiers"}, "6602821915": {"Name": "Mallick U.", "AuthorID": "6602821915", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Northern Centre for Cancer Care, Freeman Hospital"}, "57204025378": {"Name": "Hackshaw A.", "AuthorID": "57204025378", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research United Kingdom, UCL Cancer Trials Centre, University College London"}, "11839081200": {"Name": "Mehanna H.", "AuthorID": "11839081200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
