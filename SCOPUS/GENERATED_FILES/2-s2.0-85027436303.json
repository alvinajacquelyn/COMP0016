Ligand functions fall into three basic types: substrates, regulatory molecules, and cofactors essential to protein stability, reactivity, or enzyme-substrate complex formation. The regulation of potassium ion movement in bacteria is predominantly under the control of regulatory ligands that gate the relevant channels and transporters, which possess subunits or domains that contain Rossmann folds (RFs). Here we demonstrate that adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is bound to both RFs of the dimeric bacterial Kef potassium efflux system (Kef), where it plays a structural role. We conclude that AMP binds with high affinity, ensuring that the site is fully occupied at all times in the cell. Loss of the ability to bind AMP, we demonstrate, causes protein, and likely dimer, instability and consequent loss of function. Kef system function is regulated via the reversible binding of comparatively low-affinity glutathione-based ligands at the interface between the dimer subunits. We propose this interfacial binding site is itself stabilized, at least in part, by AMP binding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine monophosphate", "Enzyme-substrate complexes", "Fundamental properties", "Interfacial binding", "Potassium efflux", "Protein stability", "Reversible binding", "System functions", "Adenosine Monophosphate", "Potassium-Hydrogen Antiporters", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Folding", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Stability", "Protein Structure, Quaternary", "Shewanella"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027436303", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"36700228300": {"Name": "Pliotas C.", "AuthorID": "36700228300", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Complex, University of St Andrews"}, "9737687700": {"Name": "Marius P.", "AuthorID": "9737687700", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Complex, University of St Andrews"}, "7005691850": {"Name": "Naismith J.H.", "AuthorID": "7005691850", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine, Old Road Campus"}, "55800351800": {"Name": "Grayer S.C.", "AuthorID": "55800351800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "54408131700": {"Name": "Chan A.K.N.", "AuthorID": "54408131700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "37066077100": {"Name": "Healy J.", "AuthorID": "37066077100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57013798600": {"Name": "Khan A.", "AuthorID": "57013798600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "37015316800": {"Name": "Cortopassi W.A.", "AuthorID": "37015316800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "14631098900": {"Name": "Paton R.S.", "AuthorID": "14631098900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7003806104": {"Name": "Claridge T.D.W.", "AuthorID": "7003806104", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7101690804": {"Name": "Conway S.J.", "AuthorID": "7101690804", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies-FRIAS, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "56109970300": {"Name": "Ekkerman S.", "AuthorID": "56109970300", "AffiliationID": "60011032", "AffiliationName": "Medical Sciences and Nutrition, School of Medicine"}, "8127816600": {"Name": "Bartlett W.", "AuthorID": "8127816600", "AffiliationID": "60011032", "AffiliationName": "Medical Sciences and Nutrition, School of Medicine"}, "7103159112": {"Name": "Rasmussen T.", "AuthorID": "7103159112", "AffiliationID": "60011032", "AffiliationName": "Medical Sciences and Nutrition, School of Medicine"}, "57189229359": {"Name": "Miller S.", "AuthorID": "57189229359", "AffiliationID": "60011032", "AffiliationName": "Medical Sciences and Nutrition, School of Medicine"}, "7101793495": {"Name": "Booth I.R.", "AuthorID": "7101793495", "AffiliationID": "60011032", "AffiliationName": "Medical Sciences and Nutrition, School of Medicine"}, "57195358521": {"Name": "Chandler S.A.", "AuthorID": "57195358521", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7003428980": {"Name": "Benesch J.L.P.", "AuthorID": "7003428980", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
