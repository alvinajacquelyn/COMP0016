Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Few studies have recommended the essential domains of healthy aging and their relevant measurement to assess healthy aging comprehensively. This review is to fill the gap, by conducting a literature review of domains and measures of healthy aging in epidemiological studies. DESIGN AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted up to March 31, 2017, supplemented by a search of references in all relevant articles in English. We made a final selection of 50 studies across 23 countries or regions. RESULTS: Nineteen studies applied Rowe and Kahn's three standards to assess healthy aging. Thirty-seven studies measured physical capabilities mainly by (instrumental) activities of daily living. Cognitive functions were included in 33 studies. Nineteen of them applied Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Twenty-six studies considered metabolic and physiological health, but they mainly asked the self-reported absence of diseases. Twenty-four studies assessed psychological well-being by employing diverse scales. Questions about participation in social activities were mainly asked to measure social well-being in 22 studies. Sixteen studies considered individuals' general health status, which was mainly measured by self-rated health. Security questions were asked in five studies. Health behaviors were taken into account by three studies. Fifteen studies either applied SF-12/36 or developed health indices to assess healthy aging. IMPLICATIONS: This review summarizes detailed scales or methods that have been used to assess healthy aging in previous epidemiological studies. It also discusses and recommends the essential domains of healthy aging, and the relevant instruments for further epidemiological research to use in the assessment of healthy aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domain", "Healthy Aging", "Measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Cognition", "Epidemiologic Studies", "Health Behavior", "Health Status", "Healthy Aging", "Humans", "Mental Health", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Self Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069911061", "SubjectAreas": [["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57192370107": {"Name": "Lu W.", "AuthorID": "57192370107", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}}}
