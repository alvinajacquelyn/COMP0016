Non-verbal social communication is realized through our ability to read and understand information present in other people's actions. It has been proposed that employing the same motor programs, we use to execute an action when observing the same action underlies this action understanding. The main prediction of this framework is that action perception should be strongly correlated with parameters of action execution. Here, we demonstrate that subjects' sensitivity to observed movement speeds is dependent upon how quickly they themselves executed the observed action. This result is consistent with the motor theory of social cognition and suggests that failures in non-verbal social interactions between individuals may in part result from differences in how those individuals move.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action observation", "Action perception", "Mirror neurons", "Movement disorders", "Perception deficits"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Cognition", "Communication", "Dystonia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement", "Movement Disorders", "Nonverbal Communication", "Observation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Social Behavior", "Social Perception", "Tremor", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939494899", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"35722502400": {"Name": "Macerollo A.", "AuthorID": "35722502400", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and Sense Organs, University of Bari"}, "56785064600": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "56785064600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36167347400": {"Name": "Ricciardi L.", "AuthorID": "36167347400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.J.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006483714": {"Name": "Kilner J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006483714", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
