While there is a growing corpus of sociopsychological research articles focusing on how major geopolitical events and historical processes bear on people\u2019s lives, we aim to investigate the theoretical potential of postcolonial theory within the disciplines aiming at a sociopsychological approach. By focusing on the social dynamics of power imbalances, post-colonial theory finds its operational meaning: the feelings stemming from actions committed in the past are indeed crucial in determining reparatory attitudes and policies towards members of former colonized groups. Firstly, drawing from the sociopsychological scientific production related to consequences of colonial past, seen in recent years as a growing research interest in the field, we will explore patterns and trends through a thematic analysis of literature. Social Psychology as well as adjacent disciplines can greatly benefit from this theoretical fertilization, especially in the way post-colonial ideologies relate to the symbolic promotion versus exclusion of indigenous culture (Sengupta et al., International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 36(4), 506\u2013517, 2012). Furthermore, by comparing and contrasting the ideological cosmologies relating to this particular topic, this study aims to establish the state of knowledge in the field, to identify how research methods and thematic fields are paired, to find \u201cgaps\u201d and create spaces for research that become integrative of postcolonial theory. While focusing on academic production, we also hope to contribute to develop the idea of cosmopolitism within academia but also beyond academic doors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical psychology", "Ideology", "Indigenous psychology", "Interdisciplinarity", "Intergroup relations", "IRaMuTeQ", "Postcolonial theory", "Social psychology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colonialism", "Group Processes", "Humans", "Psychological Theory", "Psychology, Social"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031928262", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"57196124253": {"Name": "Tomicic A.", "AuthorID": "57196124253", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57196117365": {"Name": "Berardi F.", "AuthorID": "57196117365", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza University of Rome"}}}
