Pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement (PAE) measured by computed tomography correlates with pulmonary hypertension and COPD exacerbation frequency. Genome-wide association studies of PAE in subjects with COPD have not been reported. To investigate whether genetic variants are associated with PAE within subjects with COPD, we investigated data from current and former smokers from the COPDGene Study and the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints study. The ratio of the diameter of the PA to the diameter of the aorta (A) was measured using computed tomography. PAE was defined as PA/A greater than 1. A genome-wide association study for COPD with PAE was performed using subjects with COPD without PAE (PA/A \u2264 1) as a control group. A secondary analysis used smokers with normal spirometry as a control group. Genotyping was performed on Illumina platforms. The results were summarized using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Both meta-analyses revealed a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 15q25.1 in IREB2 (COPD with versus without PAE, rs7181486; odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; P = 2.10 \u00d7 10-8; versus smoking control subjects, rs2009746; OR = 1.42; P = 1.32 \u00d7 10-9). PAE was also associated with a region on 14q31.3 near the GALC gene (rs7140285; OR = 1.55; P = 3.75 \u00d7 10-8). Genetic variants near IREB2 and GALC likely contribute to genetic susceptibility to PAE associated with COPD. This study provides evidence for genetic heterogeneity associated with a clinically important COPD vascular subtype.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "Genome-wide association", "Pulmonary hypertension", "Subtyping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Galactosylceramidase", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Iron Regulatory Protein 2", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Pulmonary Artery", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924163096", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57203736032": {"Name": "Lee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57203736032", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57219307474": {"Name": "Cho M.H.", "AuthorID": "57219307474", "AffiliationID": "60001018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University"}, "6701515147": {"Name": "Hersh C.P.", "AuthorID": "6701515147", "AffiliationID": "60001018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University"}, "23050994300": {"Name": "McDonald M.L.N.", "AuthorID": "23050994300", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57203069737": {"Name": "Silverman E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203069737", "AffiliationID": "60001018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University"}, "55349830800": {"Name": "Wells J.M.", "AuthorID": "55349830800", "AffiliationID": "60105917", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "6603516755": {"Name": "Dransfield M.T.", "AuthorID": "6603516755", "AffiliationID": "60105917", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "7005868832": {"Name": "Bowler R.P.", "AuthorID": "7005868832", "AffiliationID": "60102305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, National Jewish Health"}, "26642896600": {"Name": "Lynch D.A.", "AuthorID": "26642896600", "AffiliationID": "60102305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, National Jewish Health"}, "7005677236": {"Name": "Crapo J.D.", "AuthorID": "7005677236", "AffiliationID": "60102305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, National Jewish Health"}, "35391622600": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "35391622600", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}}}
