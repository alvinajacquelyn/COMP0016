The performance of buildings and geotechnical structures within the affected regions were investigated to gain insights on their design and construction deficiencies. Findings on these damages observed are compared along with the characteristics of the earthquake and nature of building codes in these countries. They include building damages attributed to a combination of structural resonance, deficiencies in reinforcement detailing, vulnerability to soft story collapse, ground settlement, soil liquefaction, and landslides. It was demonstrated that buildings which were severely damaged had natural building frequencies coinciding with the dominant frequencies of the ground shaking. The locations of damage of several such buildings showed insufficient confining reinforcements and lapping of stirrup links. Soft story collapses were also observed in the three earthquakes, although many were attributed to old building codes that were less effective. In areas affected by the Muisne earthquake, soft story collapses were mainly found at mid height of the building rather than at the ground floor as observed in the Padang and T\u014dhoku earthquakes, likely due to extension of building long after the bottom floors were completed. Such extension of building can either lead to local reduction in capacity due to weaker concrete-rebar bonding, possibly insufficient lapping of reinforcement, as well as increased axial loads. In the aspect of geotechnical failure, foundations of buildings found on piles performed reasonably well, except for areas affected by soil liquefaction. Landslides occurred following these earthquakes led to large concentration of casualties and property losses, motivating the EEFIT teams to invest efforts in hazard mapping and ground-truthing exercises using satellite images at Padang and Muisne earthquakes respectively. Such geospatial tools applied in these three earthquakes were reviewed and demonstrated to be capable of identifying landslide sites and producing reliable landslide hazard map.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buildings", "Earthquakes", "Foundations", "Geospatial tools", "Landslides", "Muisne", "Padang", "T\u014dhoku"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069515551", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55121481700": {"Name": "Chian S.C.", "AuthorID": "55121481700", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "57016169900": {"Name": "Wilkinson S.M.", "AuthorID": "57016169900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Newcastle University"}, "55206205500": {"Name": "Whittle J.K.", "AuthorID": "55206205500", "AffiliationID": "115221393", "AffiliationName": "Magnusson Klemencic Associates"}, "57004790800": {"Name": "Mulyani R.", "AuthorID": "57004790800", "AffiliationID": "60107787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Universitas Bung Hatta"}, "10642230000": {"Name": "Alarcon J.E.", "AuthorID": "10642230000", "AffiliationID": "60115495", "AffiliationName": "Willis Re"}, "6507380260": {"Name": "Pomonis A.", "AuthorID": "6507380260", "AffiliationID": "60112873", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Architectural Research, Ltd."}, "55125368100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "55125368100", "AffiliationID": "60112873", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Architectural Research, Ltd."}, "57220725022": {"Name": "Fraser S.", "AuthorID": "57220725022", "AffiliationID": "122909226", "AffiliationName": "Fraster Disaster Risk Consulting"}, "12759820500": {"Name": "Goda K.", "AuthorID": "12759820500", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Western University"}, "24758945000": {"Name": "Macabuag J.", "AuthorID": "24758945000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, University College London"}, "57208387769": {"Name": "Stone H.", "AuthorID": "57208387769", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, University College London"}, "55123980900": {"Name": "Offord M.", "AuthorID": "55123980900", "AffiliationID": "122908975", "AffiliationName": "Sellafield Sites"}, "57193492325": {"Name": "Hunt-Raby A.C.", "AuthorID": "57193492325", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Plymouth"}, "6603943658": {"Name": "Sammonds P.", "AuthorID": "6603943658", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "7102415372": {"Name": "Franco G.", "AuthorID": "7102415372", "AffiliationID": "122909441", "AffiliationName": "Guy Carpenter"}, "57205670078": {"Name": "Hughes F.E.", "AuthorID": "57205670078", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "57210112190": {"Name": "Jirouskova N.K.", "AuthorID": "57210112190", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55884511100": {"Name": "Kaminski S.", "AuthorID": "55884511100", "AffiliationID": "60099927", "AffiliationName": "Arup London"}, "57202882732": {"Name": "Lopez J.", "AuthorID": "57202882732", "AffiliationID": "60099927", "AffiliationName": "Arup London"}}}
