Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.In this paper, we identify patterns of subject and qualification choices made at age 14. Much of the previous research on \u2018subject choice\u2019 has focussed on the later stages of educational trajectories, particularly Higher Education. However, the choices made at early branching points can limit pupils\u2019 subsequent options, potentially contributing to educational inequalities. This paper identifies the patterns of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) subjects chosen by a cohort of young people born in 1989/1990. We make use of the Next Steps data (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE)) which is linked to the National Pupil Database. We develop an approach to measuring the academic selectivity of subjects and qualifications. We examine the roles of social class, parental education, income, gender and ethnicity in determining participation in these curriculum groupings. Using measures of prior attainment from age thirteen, we address the question of whether curriculum differentials simply reflect differences in prior attainment or whether they actually operate above and beyond existing inequalities. We find clear socio-economic, gender, ethnic and school-level differences in subjects studied which cannot be accounted for by prior attainment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["educational inequalities", "ethnic variation", "GCSEs", "gender difference", "STEM", "Subject choice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036552295", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57193543556": {"Name": "Henderson M.", "AuthorID": "57193543556", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56467722000": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "56467722000", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56960008800": {"Name": "Anders J.", "AuthorID": "56960008800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56500181500": {"Name": "Moulton V.", "AuthorID": "56500181500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
