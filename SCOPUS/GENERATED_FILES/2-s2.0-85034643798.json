Interoceptive impairment may contribute to the profound socioemotional symptoms that characterize frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, but remains poorly defined. Methods: Patients representing all major FTD syndromes and healthy age-matched controls performed a heartbeat counting task as a measure of interoceptive accuracy. In addition, patients had volumetric MRI for voxel-based morphometric analysis, and their caregivers completed a questionnaire assessing patients' daily-life sensitivity to the emotions of others. Results: Interoceptive accuracy was impaired in patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia relative to healthy age-matched individuals, but not in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia. Impaired interoceptive accuracy correlated with reduced daily-life emotional sensitivity across the patient cohort, and with atrophy of right insula, cingulate, and amygdala on voxel-based morphometry in the impaired semantic variant group, delineating a network previously shown to support interoceptive processing in the healthy brain. Conclusion: Interoception is a promising novel paradigm for defining mechanisms of reduced emotional reactivity, empathy, and self-awareness in neurodegenerative syndromes and may yield objective measures for these complex symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomic", "Cardiac", "Empathy", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Interoception", "Primary progressive aphasia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034643798", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56402543600": {"Name": "Marshall C.", "AuthorID": "56402543600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57038112100": {"Name": "Hardy C.", "AuthorID": "57038112100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "57194327207": {"Name": "Russell L.", "AuthorID": "57194327207", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "57213539180": {"Name": "Clark C.", "AuthorID": "57213539180", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "57189237366": {"Name": "Dick K.", "AuthorID": "57189237366", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "56079056500": {"Name": "Brotherhood E.", "AuthorID": "56079056500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "57188569347": {"Name": "Bond R.", "AuthorID": "57188569347", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "7006655431": {"Name": "Mummery C.", "AuthorID": "7006655431", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "7006483714": {"Name": "Kilner J.", "AuthorID": "7006483714", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
