KGaA, WeinheimHydrogen produced from water splitting is a renewable and clean energy source. Great efforts have been paid in searching for inexpensive and highly efficient photocatalysts. Here, significant enhancement of hydrogen production has been achieved by introducing \u22481 mol% of MoS2 to Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles. The MoS2/Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles showed a hydrogen evolution rate of \u22480.47 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 in the presence of sacrificial agents, which is 7.8 times that of Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles (0.06 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121). In addition, the MoS2/Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles exhibited high stability, and only \u22483% of catalytic activity was lost after a long time irradiation (72 h). Microstructure investigation on the MoS2/Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles reveals that the intimate contact between the nanostructured MoS2 and Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles provides an effective one-way expressway for photogenerated electrons transferring from the conduction band of Cu2ZnSnS4 to MoS2, thus boosting the lifetime of charge carriers, as well as reducing the recombination rate of electrons and holes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cu2ZnSnS4", "microstructure", "MoS2", "photocatalyst"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clean energy sources", "Cu2ZnSnS4", "Electrons and holes", "Hydrogen evolution rate", "Microstructure investigations", "MoS2", "Photogenerated electrons", "Sacrificial agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046339078", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56449603000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56449603000", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56211000400": {"Name": "Lin Y.", "AuthorID": "56211000400", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55472940100": {"Name": "Ji H.", "AuthorID": "55472940100", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "36441549600": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "36441549600", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56210635700": {"Name": "Ashalley E.", "AuthorID": "56210635700", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "15052300200": {"Name": "Niu X.", "AuthorID": "15052300200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56582932000": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "56582932000", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57207835722": {"Name": "Usman M.", "AuthorID": "57207835722", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55697256700": {"Name": "Bao J.", "AuthorID": "55697256700", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Houston"}}}
