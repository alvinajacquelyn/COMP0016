Such diversity arises through coupling of extracellular ligand-binding portions with highly variable intracellular sequences flanking the tyrosine kinase domain and specific patterns of autophosphorylation sites. Here, we show that the juxtamembrane (JM) segment enhances RET catalytic domain activity through Y687. This phospho-site is also required by the JM region to rescue an otherwise catalytically deficient RET activation-loop mutant lacking tyrosines. Structure-function analyses identified interactions between the JM hinge, \u03b1C helix, and an unconventional activation-loop serine phosphorylation site that engages the HRD motif and promotes phospho-tyrosine conformational accessibility and regulatory spine assembly. We demonstrate that this phospho-S909 arises from an intrinsic RET dual-specificity kinase activity and show that an equivalent serine is required for RET signaling in Drosophila. Our findings reveal dual-specificity and allosteric components for the mechanism of RET activation and signaling with direct implications for drug discovery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drosophila", "dual-specificity", "oncogene", "phosphorylation", "receptor tyrosine kinase", "RTK", "signaling", "structure-function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Enzyme Activation", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Serine", "Signal Transduction", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006721128", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"15027239000": {"Name": "Plaza-Menacho I.", "AuthorID": "15027239000", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57192558898": {"Name": "Chauhan R.", "AuthorID": "57192558898", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "23111047200": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Torres R.J.", "AuthorID": "23111047200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7102832898": {"Name": "McDonald N.Q.", "AuthorID": "7102832898", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "6602559109": {"Name": "Barnouin K.", "AuthorID": "6602559109", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Analysis and Proteomics, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "56080250100": {"Name": "Borg A.", "AuthorID": "56080250100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Production Facility, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "12791814700": {"Name": "Mouilleron S.", "AuthorID": "12791814700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Science Technology Platform, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "55163736100": {"Name": "Barry R.", "AuthorID": "55163736100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre, Mary-Jean Mitchell Green Building, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "12786650800": {"Name": "Orme M.", "AuthorID": "12786650800", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre, Mary-Jean Mitchell Green Building, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "35269496900": {"Name": "Meier P.", "AuthorID": "35269496900", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre, Mary-Jean Mitchell Green Building, Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
