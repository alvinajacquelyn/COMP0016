We take advantage of a sample of 25 high signal-to-noise ratio QSO spectra to retrieve 150 triply-ionized carbon (C IV) absorbers at 4.5 \u2272 z \u2272 6.2, of which 37 systems whose expected H I absorption lie in the Lyman-\u03b1 forest. We derive improved constraints on the cosmic density of CIV at 4.3 < z < 6.2 and infer from abundance matching that C IV absorbers trace MUV \u2272 \u221216 galaxies. Correlation with the Lyman-\u03b1 forest of the QSOs indicates that these objects are surrounded by a highly opaque region at r \u2272 5 cMpc h\u22121 followed by an excess of transmission at r \u2273 10 cMpc h\u22121 detected at 2.7\u03c3. This is in contrast to equivalent measurements at lower redshifts where only the opaque trough is detected. We interpret this excess as a statistical enhancement of the local photoionization rate due to clustered faint galaxies around the C IV absorbers. Using the analytical framework described in Paper I of this series, we derive a constraint on the average product of the escape fraction and the Lyman continuum photon production efficiency of the galaxy population clustered around the C IV absorbers, log\u3008fesc\u03beion\u3009/[erg\u22121Hz] = 25.01+\u2212003019. This implies that faint galaxies beyond the reach of current facilities may have harder radiation fields and/or larger escape fractions than currently detected objects at the end of the reionization epoch.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark ages", "First stars", "Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: high-redshift", "Intergalactic medium", "Quasars: absorption lines", "Reionization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067190414", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57203395501": {"Name": "Meyer R.A.", "AuthorID": "57203395501", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56801633200": {"Name": "Bosman S.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56801633200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55413049700": {"Name": "Kakiichi K.", "AuthorID": "55413049700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.S.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
