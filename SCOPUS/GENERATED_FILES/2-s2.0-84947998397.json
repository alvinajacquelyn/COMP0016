Based on the homogeneous flow assumption, the model accounts for the pertinent valve characteristics, including the activation and closure times, as well as its proximity to the rupture location. The validation of the model is based on the comparison of its predictions against measurements taken following the controlled Full Bore Rupture (FBR) of a 113-m long, 148mm i.d. pipeline containing CO2 at 15.1MPa and 300K, incorporating a ball valve along its length. The data recorded and simulated include the transient fluid temperatures and pressures immediately upstream and downstream of the closing valve following FBR. In all cases, very good agreement between the model predictions and recorded data is reported. Importantly, the minimum fluid temperature downstream of the closing valve is found to fall below the CO2 triple point indicating solid CO2 formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CO2 pipeline safety", "ESDV modelling", "Multiphase flow", "Pipeline flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Emergency shut-down valves", "Experimental validations", "Fluid temperatures", "High-pressure carbon dioxide", "Pipeline safety", "Rupture location", "Transportation pipelines", "Valve characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947998397", "SubjectAreas": [["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7003505415": {"Name": "Mahgerefteh H.", "AuthorID": "7003505415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55921743100": {"Name": "Sundara V.", "AuthorID": "55921743100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57214631878": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "57214631878", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "26531554000": {"Name": "Martynov S.", "AuthorID": "26531554000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
