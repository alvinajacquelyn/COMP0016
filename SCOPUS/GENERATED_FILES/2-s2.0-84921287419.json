[AlF(bdc)] has an orthorhombic large pore structure from 500 to \u223c175 K at which point it undergoes a subtle distortion to form a monoclinic large pore structure that remains stable to 11 K. The orthorhombic large pore form of [AlF(bdc)] exhibits negative thermal expansion from 175-500 K. [Al(OH)(bdc)] has an orthorhombic large pore structure from 500 to 125 K at which point it undergoes a displacive phase transition, a breathing effect, to form a nonporous monoclinic structure. The orthorhombic large pore form of [Al(OH)(bdc)] exhibits positive thermal expansion from 150 to 500 K. The presence of a breathing effect in [Al(OH)(bdc)], and not [AlF(bdc)], is related to the additional contributions to attractive interactions across the shortest dimension of the pore provided by the presence of the hydroxide groups. The display of positive or negative thermal expansion of the orthorhombic large pore structure of either material is related to the rigidity of the constituent corner-sharing chain of AlO4X2 octahedra with the more rigid AlO4F2 octahedra favoring one type of static or dynamic displacement and the less rigid AlO4(OH)2 octahedra favoring a different type of static displacement. Formation of metal-organic frameworks with controlled expansion and displacive phase transition properties, or simultaneously containing mixed thermoresponsive properties, is predicted through control of the identity and amount of the simple inorganic anions in this family of material. The work indicates the importance of considering the simplest species when designing the thermo-mechanical properties of metal-organic frameworks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attractive interactions", "Computational technique", "Displacive phase transitions", "Dynamic displacements", "Metal organic framework", "Negative thermal expansion", "Thermo-responsive behaviors", "Thermomechanical properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921287419", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56486132000": {"Name": "Nanthamathee C.", "AuthorID": "56486132000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanoporous Materials, School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "7006807874": {"Name": "Attfield M.", "AuthorID": "7006807874", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanoporous Materials, School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "15073064200": {"Name": "Ling S.", "AuthorID": "15073064200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54785285800": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "54785285800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
