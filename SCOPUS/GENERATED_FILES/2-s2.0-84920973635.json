However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian inference", "Control", "Gaussian processes", "Policy search", "Reinforcement learning", "Robotics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian inference", "Engineering knowledge", "Gaussian Processes", "Model uncertainties", "Modeling-based learning", "Policy search", "Realistic simulators", "Underlying dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920973635", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"24922891000": {"Name": "Deisenroth M.", "AuthorID": "24922891000", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, TU Darmstadt"}, "7402074129": {"Name": "Fox D.", "AuthorID": "7402074129", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington"}, "7103365199": {"Name": "Rasmussen C.", "AuthorID": "7103365199", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}}}
