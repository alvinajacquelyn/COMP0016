Aerobic and anaerobic exercise results in alterations in redox homeostasis (ARH) in untrained, trained and well trained athletes. Low to moderate doses of ROS and RNS play a role in muscle adaptation to endurance training, but an overwhelming increase in RNS and ROS may lead to increased cell apoptosis and immunosuppression, fatigued states and underperformance.Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review are: (a) to test the hypotheses that ARH occur in elite endurance athletes; following an acute exercise bout, in an endurance race or competition; across a micro-, meso- or macro-training cycle; following a training taper; before, during and after altitude training; in females with amenorrhoea versus eumenorrhoea; and in non-functional over-reaching (NFOR) and overtraining states (OTS); (b) to report any relationship between ARH and training load and ARH and performance; and (c) to apply critical difference values for measures of oxidative stress/ARH to address whether there is any evidence of ARH being of physiological significance (not just statistical) and thus relevant to health and performance in the elite athlete.Methods: Electronic databases, Embase, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus were searched for relevant articles. Only studies that were observational articles of cross-sectional or longitudinal design, and included elite athletes competing at national or international level in endurance sports were included. Studies had to include biomarkers of ARH; oxidative damage, antioxidant enzymes, antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant vitamins and nutrients in urine, serum, plasma, whole blood, red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs). A total of 3,057 articles were identified from the electronic searches. Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.Results: ARH occurs in elite endurance athletes, after acute exercise, a competition or race, across training phases, and with natural or simulated altitude. A reduction in ARH occurs across the season in elite athletes, with marked variation around intensified training phases, between individuals, and the greatest disturbances (of physiological significance) occurring with live-high-train-low techniques, and in athletes competing. A relationship with ARH and performance and illness exists in elite athletes. There was considerable heterogeneity across the studies for the biomarkers and assays used; the sport; the blood sampling time points; and the phase in the annual training cycle and thus baseline athlete fitness. In addition, there was a consistent lack of reporting of the analytical variability of the assays used to assess ARH.Conclusions: The reported biochemical changes around ARH in elite athletes suggest that it may be of value to monitor biomarkers of ARH at rest, pre- and post-simulated performance tests, and before and after training micro- and meso-cycles, and altitude camps, to identify individual tolerance to training loads, potentially allowing the prevention of non-functionally over-reached states and optimisation of the individual training taper and training programme.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Exercise", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Oxidative Stress", "Physical Education and Training", "Physical Endurance", "Sports"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925541734", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"36174997600": {"Name": "Lewis N.A.", "AuthorID": "36174997600", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "St Mary\u2019s University"}, "57208828407": {"Name": "Morton K.", "AuthorID": "57208828407", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "7404772169": {"Name": "Hill J.", "AuthorID": "7404772169", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "St Mary\u2019s University"}, "8502823700": {"Name": "Pedlar C.R.", "AuthorID": "8502823700", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "St Mary\u2019s University"}, "56017121400": {"Name": "Howatson G.", "AuthorID": "56017121400", "AffiliationID": "60029714", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Group, School of Environmental Sciences and Development, Northwest University"}}}
