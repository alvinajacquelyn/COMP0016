Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.SummaryThis paper describes the development of a novel online, heterogeneous image reconstruction system for magnetic resonance data. The system integrates an external computer equipped with a graphic processing unit card into the magnetic resonance scanner's image reconstruction pipeline. The system promotes fast online reconstruction for computationally intensive algorithms making them feasible in a busy clinical service. Analysis and improvement of execution time of the complex, iterative reconstruction algorithm is presented. Specifically, optimizations were examined that allowed fast reconstruction of data that were acquired in an arbitrary manner. The system was successfully used in research and clinical studies requiring high data throughput.", "AuthorKeywords": ["execution optimization", "GPGPU - CUDA", "real-life application"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computationally intensive algorithms", "Execution optimization", "GPGPU - CUDA", "Graphic processing units", "Iterative reconstruction algorithms", "Magnetic resonance scanners", "Real-life applications", "Reconstruction systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925595059", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"6602362169": {"Name": "Kowalik G.T.", "AuthorID": "6602362169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.A.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
