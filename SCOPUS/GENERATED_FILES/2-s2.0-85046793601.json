Background. Brain structural abnormalities have been reported in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) who are receiving suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but their pathophysiology remains unclear. Methods. We investigated factors associated with brain tissue volumes and white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy) in 134 PLWH receiving suppressive cART and 79 comparable HIV-negative controls, aged \u226545 years, from the Comorbidity in Relation to AIDS cohort, using multimodal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Results. Compared with controls, PLWH had lower gray matter volumes (\u221213.7 mL; 95% confidence interval, \u221225.1 to \u22122.2) and fractional anisotropy (\u22120.0073; 95% confidence interval, \u2212.012 to \u2212.0024), with the largest differences observed in those with prior clinical AIDS. Hypertension and the soluble CD14 concentration in cerebrospinal fluid were associated with lower fractional anisotropy. These associations were independent of HIV serostatus (P interaction = .32 and P interaction = .59, respectively) and did not explain the greater abnormalities in brain structure in relation to HIV infection. Conclusions. The presence of lower gray matter volumes and more white matter microstructural abnormalities in well-treated PLWH partly reflect a combination of historical effects of AIDS, as well as the more general influence of systemic factors, such as hypertension and ongoing neuroinflammation. Additional mechanisms explaining the accentuation of brain structure abnormalities in treated HIV infection remain to be identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "HIV", "Neurofilament light chain", "Neuroimaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Sustained Virologic Response"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046793601", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6701695606": {"Name": "Wit F.W.", "AuthorID": "6701695606", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60138854", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam Institute Global Health and Development, Amsterdam Health Technology Center"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60138854", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam Institute Global Health and Development, Amsterdam Health Technology Center"}, "55908175900": {"Name": "Caan M.W.A.", "AuthorID": "55908175900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology"}, "7003925999": {"Name": "Majoie C.B.L.M.", "AuthorID": "7003925999", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology"}, "6603966335": {"Name": "Kootstra N.A.", "AuthorID": "6603966335", "AffiliationID": "109247965", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center"}, "56274879200": {"Name": "Portegies P.", "AuthorID": "56274879200", "AffiliationID": "60022969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis"}, "47661632000": {"Name": "Underwood J.", "AuthorID": "47661632000", "AffiliationID": "100354385", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "100354385", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "7403376270": {"Name": "Cole J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403376270", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "35559514400": {"Name": "Sharp D.J.", "AuthorID": "35559514400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "56074756400": {"Name": "De Francesco D.", "AuthorID": "56074756400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "35414205100": {"Name": "Fuchs D.", "AuthorID": "35414205100", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "57201969798": {"Name": "Gissl\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "57201969798", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56584850400": {"Name": "Van Zoest R.A.", "AuthorID": "56584850400", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60138854", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam Institute Global Health and Development, Amsterdam Health Technology Center"}}}
