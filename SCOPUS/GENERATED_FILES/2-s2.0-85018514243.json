All rights reserved.Hunting is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced defaunation is lacking. We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Bird and mammal abundances declined by 58% (25 to 76%) and by 83% (72 to 90%) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. Bird and mammal populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters' access points (roads and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. Mammal population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "Birds", "Extinction, Biological", "Human Activities", "Mammals", "Population Density"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018514243", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35728380700": {"Name": "Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez A.", "AuthorID": "35728380700", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, Institute for Wetland and Water Research, Radboud University"}, "6701896825": {"Name": "Huijbregts M.A.J.", "AuthorID": "6701896825", "AffiliationID": "60004840", "AffiliationName": "PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency"}, "36981462600": {"Name": "Alkemade R.", "AuthorID": "36981462600", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Systems Analysis Group, Wageningen University"}, "22136407400": {"Name": "Schipper A.M.", "AuthorID": "22136407400", "AffiliationID": "60004840", "AffiliationName": "PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency"}, "57194062034": {"Name": "Eikelboom J.A.J.", "AuthorID": "57194062034", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University and Research"}, "56457522000": {"Name": "Ingram D.J.", "AuthorID": "56457522000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "22936481400": {"Name": "Verweij P.A.", "AuthorID": "22936481400", "AffiliationID": "60018815, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University"}}}
