We propose an extension of the hyper Markov properties of Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272-1317], which we term structural Markov properties, for both undirected decomposable and directed acyclic graphs, which requires that the structure of distinct components of the graph be conditionally independent given the existence of a separating component. This allows the analysis and comparison of multiple graphical structures, while being able to take advantage of the common conditional independence constraints. Moreover, we show that these properties characterise exponential families, which form conjugate priors under sampling from compatible Markov distributions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graphical models", "Hyper Markov laws", "Structural estimation", "Structural Markov laws"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933525968", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"55849165900": {"Name": "Byrne S.", "AuthorID": "55849165900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "55663578500": {"Name": "Dawid A.", "AuthorID": "55663578500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
