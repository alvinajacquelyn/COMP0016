This new generation of sensors has the advantage of not requiring cryogenic cooling and as a result can be flexibly placed on any part of the body. The purpose of this review is to provide a neuroscience audience with the theoretical background needed to understand the physical basis for the signal observed by OPMs. Those already familiar with the physics of MRI and NMR should note that OPMs share much of the same theory as the operation of OPMs rely on magnetic resonance. This review establishes the physical basis for the signal equation for OPMs. We re-derive the equations defining the bounds on OPM performance and highlight the important trade-offs between quantities such as bandwidth, sensor size and sensitivity. These equations lead to a direct upper bound on the gain change due to cross-talk for a multi-channel OPM system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Magnetic Phenomena", "Magnetoencephalography", "Optical Phenomena"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067391748", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56921739000": {"Name": "Tierney T.M.", "AuthorID": "56921739000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57205684644": {"Name": "Mellor S.", "AuthorID": "57205684644", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57201420913": {"Name": "Holmes N.", "AuthorID": "57201420913", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57201428018": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "57201428018", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57201632590": {"Name": "Hill R.M.", "AuthorID": "57201632590", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57191490424": {"Name": "Boto E.", "AuthorID": "57191490424", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57197534488": {"Name": "Leggett J.", "AuthorID": "57197534488", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "8599486300": {"Name": "Brookes M.J.", "AuthorID": "8599486300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7005010989": {"Name": "Bowtell R.", "AuthorID": "7005010989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "37561488000": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez J.D.", "AuthorID": "37561488000", "AffiliationID": "60055833", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Faculty, Universidad de Antioquia UDEA"}, "7201440598": {"Name": "Shah V.", "AuthorID": "7201440598", "AffiliationID": "60112977", "AffiliationName": "QuSpin Inc."}}}
