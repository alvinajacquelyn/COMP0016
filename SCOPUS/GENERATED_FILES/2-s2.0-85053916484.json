However, to date, there has been no way to systematically measure this property, and the problem has been largely overlooked. We show here that a recently proposed \"center of gravity\" method for determining the composition of magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3) mixtures via 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy can be applied to the matter. We show that a long-established diffusion model can be used to characterize the oxidative aging process, yielding a parametric (and therefore predictive) description of the magnetite-to-maghemite oxidation processes occurring within the nanoparticles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical applications", "Center of gravity", "Environmental aging", "Iron oxide nanomaterials", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Mechanism of action", "Oxidation process", "Ssbauer spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053916484", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"23468740200": {"Name": "Bogart L.", "AuthorID": "23468740200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "35758304700": {"Name": "Blanco-Andujar C.", "AuthorID": "35758304700", "AffiliationID": "121390173", "AffiliationName": "MediSieve Limited, Translation and Innovation Hub"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}}}
