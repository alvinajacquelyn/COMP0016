Recently, G proteins derived from other vesiculoviruses (VesG), for example, Cocal virus, have been proposed as alternative LV envelopes with possible advantages over VSVind.G. Well-characterized antibodies that recognize VesG will be useful for vesiculovirus research, development of G protein-containing advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), and deployment of VSVind-based vaccine vectors. Here, we show that one commercially available monoclonal antibody, 8G5F11, binds to and neutralizes G proteins from three strains of VSV, as well as Cocal and Maraba viruses, whereas the other commercially available monoclonal anti-VSVind.G antibody, IE9F9, binds to and neutralizes only VSVind.G. Using a combination of G protein chimeras and site-directed mutations, we mapped the binding epitopes of IE9F9 and 8G5F11 on VSVind.G. IE9F9 binds close to the receptor binding site and competes with soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for binding to VSVind.G, explaining its mechanism of neutralization. In contrast, 8G5F11 binds close to a region known to undergo conformational changes when the G protein moves to its postfusion structure, and we propose that 8G5F11 cross-neutralizes VesGs by inhibiting this.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Monoclonal antibodies", "Neutralizing antibodies", "Vesiculovirus", "VSV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antigens, Viral", "Cross Reactions", "Epitopes", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Neutralization Tests", "Phylogeny", "Sequence Homology", "Vesicular Stomatitis", "Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus", "Viral Envelope Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056327374", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57203570806": {"Name": "Munis A.", "AuthorID": "57203570806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57203568821": {"Name": "Tijani M.", "AuthorID": "57203568821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "26643231400": {"Name": "Collins M.", "AuthorID": "26643231400", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"}, "34868874800": {"Name": "Takeuchi Y.", "AuthorID": "34868874800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55340422200": {"Name": "Hassall M.", "AuthorID": "55340422200", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Virology, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "23566976600": {"Name": "Mattiuzzo G.", "AuthorID": "23566976600", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Virology, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}}}
