This paper is the first of a series of two that deal with the problem of tracer coefficient estimation via compartmental modelling in an inverse problem framework. Specifically, here we discuss the identifiability problem for a general n-dimension compartmental system and provide uniqueness results in the case of two-compartment and three-compartment compartmental models. The second paper will utilize this framework in order to show how nonlinear regularization schemes can be applied to obtain numerical estimates of the tracer coefficients in the case of nuclear medicine data corresponding to brain, liver and kidney physiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["compartmental analysis", "identifiability", "nuclear medicine data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Compartmental analysis", "Compartmental model", "Compartmental modelling", "Compartmental systems", "Identifiability", "Quantitative information", "Regularization schemes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009216353", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"23994857800": {"Name": "Delbary F.", "AuthorID": "23994857800", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t"}, "55884894500": {"Name": "Garbarino S.", "AuthorID": "55884894500", "AffiliationID": "60105685, 60083090", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Matematica, CNR-SPIN"}, "56711925300": {"Name": "Vivaldi V.", "AuthorID": "56711925300", "AffiliationID": "60105685, 60083090", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Matematica, CNR-SPIN"}}}
