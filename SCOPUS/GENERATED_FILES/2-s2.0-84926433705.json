I show that whenever the Agent would choose the same action under complete information at several distinct states, then full transparency can generically be improved upon. This implies that full transparency is generically suboptimal whenever the dimension of the information held by the Principal exceeds the dimension of the Agent's action. In a simple class of problems, I make further progress on the best disclosure policy assuming the Principal can either disclose fully the state or remain silent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dimensionality", "Information disclosure", "Transparency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926433705", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6602775537": {"Name": "Jehiel P.", "AuthorID": "6602775537", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60026651, 60108957", "AffiliationName": "Paris School of Economics (Ecole des Ponts, Paritech), University College London"}}}
