Methods: Twenty-one MM patients underwent WB-MRI at diagnosis and after two cycles of chemotherapy. Scans acquired at 3.0 T included T2, diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) and mDixon pre- and post-contrast. Twenty focal lesions (FLs) matched on DWI and post-contrast mDixon were selected for each time point. Estimated tumour volume (eTV), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), enhancement ratio (ER) and signal fat fraction (sFF) were derived. Clinical treatment response to chemotherapy was assessed using conventional criteria. Significance of temporal parameter change was assessed by the paired t test and receiver operating characteristics/area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed. Parameter repeatability was assessed by interclass correlation (ICC) and Bland\u2013Altman analysis of 10 healthy volunteers scanned at two time points. Results: Fifteen of 21 patients responded to treatment. Of 254 FLs analysed, sFF (p < 0.0001) and ADC (p = 0.001) significantly increased in responders but not non-responders. eTV significantly decreased in 19/21 cases. Focal lesion sFF was the best discriminator of treatment response (AUC 1.0). Bone sFF repeatability was excellent (ICC 0.98) and better than bone ADC (ICC 0.47). Conclusion: WB-MRI derived focal lesion sFF shows promise as an imaging biomarker of treatment response in newly diagnosed MM. Key Points: \u2022 Bone signal fat fraction using mDixon is a robust quantifiable parameter \u2022 Fat fraction and ADC significantly increase in myeloma lesions responding to treatment \u2022 Bone lesion fat fraction is the best discriminator of myeloma treatment response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bortezomib", "MRI", "Multiple myeloma", "Response monitoring", "Whole body"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Bortezomib", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Myeloma", "Prospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Whole Body Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021270534", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55961544100": {"Name": "Latifoltojar A.", "AuthorID": "55961544100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7005861491": {"Name": "Hall-Craggs M.", "AuthorID": "7005861491", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "15076612600": {"Name": "Dikaios N.", "AuthorID": "15076612600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "57220407689": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "57220407689", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London Hospital"}, "55220094000": {"Name": "Sokolska M.", "AuthorID": "55220094000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London Hospital"}, "22136212200": {"Name": "Rabin N.", "AuthorID": "22136212200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "8645053700": {"Name": "Popat R.", "AuthorID": "8645053700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "57188860649": {"Name": "Rismani A.", "AuthorID": "57188860649", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "14820598800": {"Name": "D\u2019Sa S.", "AuthorID": "14820598800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "7102064249": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "7102064249", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "23392100500": {"Name": "Antonelli M.", "AuthorID": "23392100500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Imaging Computing, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Imaging Computing, University College London"}}}
