All rights reserved.Background: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is underrecognised in clinical settings. Aims: To investigate whether performing a 123I-ioflupane injection (123I-FP-CIT also called DaTSCAN\u2122) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan in patients with possible DLB would lead to a more certain diagnosis (probable DLB or non-DLB dementia). Method: We randomised 187 patients with possible DLB 2:1 to have a scan or not (control group). The outcome measure was a change in diagnosis to probable DLB or non-DLB. Results: There were 56 controls and 114 scanned patients, of whom 43% had an abnormal scan. More patients in the imaging group had a change in diagnosis compared with controls at 8 and 24 weeks (61% (n = 70) v. 4% (n = 2) and 71% (n = 77) v. 16% (n = 9); both P<0.0001). Clinicians were more likely to change the diagnosis if the scan was abnormal (82%) than if it was normal (46%). Conclusions: Imaging significantly contributed to a more certain diagnosis, proving to be a useful adjunct in the work-up of patients with possible DLB.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Brain", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Lewy Body Disease", "Male", "Nortropanes", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923032877", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36830984200": {"Name": "Walker Z.", "AuthorID": "36830984200", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56223037600": {"Name": "Moreno E.", "AuthorID": "56223037600", "AffiliationID": "60106637", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare"}, "7403883588": {"Name": "Thomas A.", "AuthorID": "7403883588", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University"}, "57220393734": {"Name": "Inglis F.", "AuthorID": "57220393734", "AffiliationID": "117310655", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow Memory Clinic"}, "56248989900": {"Name": "Tabet N.", "AuthorID": "56248989900", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Medicine, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7006719142": {"Name": "Rainer M.", "AuthorID": "7006719142", "AffiliationID": "117310587", "AffiliationName": "Karl Landsteiner Institut f\u00fcr Ged\u00e4chtnis- und Alzheimerforschung"}, "7006894592": {"Name": "Pizzolato G.", "AuthorID": "7006894592", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste"}, "55996824100": {"Name": "Padovani A.", "AuthorID": "55996824100", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Scienze Cliniche e Sperimentali, University of Brescia"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
