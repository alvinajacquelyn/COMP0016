Cu-based oxides and subsequently Cu-based oxychalcogenides have been heavily studied as affordable, earth-abundant p-type transparent semiconductors, where the mixing of the Cu 3d states with the chalcogenide 2p states at the top of the valence band encourages increased valence band dispersion. In this article, we extend this mixing concept further, by utilizing quantum chemistry techniques to investigate ternary copper phosphides as potential high mobility p-type materials. We use hybrid density functional theory to examine a family of phosphides, namely, MCuP (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) which all possess extremely disperse valence band maxima, comparable to the dispersion of excellent industry standard n-type transparent conducting oxides. As a proof of concept, we synthesized and characterized powders of CaCuP, showing that they display high levels of p-type conductivity, without any external acceptor dopant. Lastly, we discuss the role of Cu-coordination in promoting valence band dispersion and provide design principles for producing degenerate p-type materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hybrid density functional theory", "Industry standards", "P type conductivity", "P type semiconductor", "Transparent conducting oxide", "Transparent devices", "Transparent p-type semiconductor", "Transparent semiconductor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016432249", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "56736199700": {"Name": "Buckeridge J.", "AuthorID": "56736199700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "57193765721": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "57193765721", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "57193361823": {"Name": "Ansbro S.", "AuthorID": "57193361823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
