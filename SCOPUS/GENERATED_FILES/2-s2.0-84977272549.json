To understand how the genetic and environmental background influences the development of multiple tumours, here we conduct a comparative analysis of 20 syCRCs from 10 patients. We show that syCRCs have independent genetic origins, acquire dissimilar somatic alterations, and have different clone composition. This inter- and intratumour heterogeneity must be considered in the selection of therapy and in the monitoring of resistance. SyCRC patients show a higher occurrence of inherited damaging mutations in immune-related genes compared to patients with solitary colorectal cancer and to healthy individuals from the 1,000 Genomes Project. Moreover, they have a different composition of immune cell populations in tumour and normal mucosa, and transcriptional differences in immune-related biological processes. This suggests an environmental field effect that promotes multiple tumours likely in the background of inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Case-Control Studies", "Clone Cells", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Cytokines", "Female", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Germ-Line Mutation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasms, Multiple Primary", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Toll-Like Receptors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977272549", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"16400964900": {"Name": "Cereda M.", "AuthorID": "16400964900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "55632076000": {"Name": "Gambardella G.", "AuthorID": "55632076000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "22833297700": {"Name": "Benedetti L.", "AuthorID": "22833297700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "57188986549": {"Name": "Mourikis T.P.", "AuthorID": "57188986549", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "55638572500": {"Name": "Sinha S.", "AuthorID": "55638572500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "6701859063": {"Name": "Ciccarelli F.D.", "AuthorID": "6701859063", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "8295682200": {"Name": "Iannelli F.", "AuthorID": "8295682200", "AffiliationID": "60083539", "AffiliationName": "IFOM, FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology"}, "57190090842": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "57190090842", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Pathology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57193932780": {"Name": "Puccio I.", "AuthorID": "57193932780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Pathology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "22036034000": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Justo M.", "AuthorID": "22036034000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Pathology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55366683000": {"Name": "Basso G.", "AuthorID": "55366683000", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gastroenterology, Department of Gastroenterology, Humanitas Research Hospital"}, "6602504037": {"Name": "Laghi L.", "AuthorID": "6602504037", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gastroenterology, Department of Gastroenterology, Humanitas Research Hospital"}, "8869392600": {"Name": "Guerra R.F.", "AuthorID": "8869392600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Craniofacial Development AndStem Cell Biology, King's College London"}, "7402630514": {"Name": "Spencer J.", "AuthorID": "7402630514", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology, King's College London"}}}
