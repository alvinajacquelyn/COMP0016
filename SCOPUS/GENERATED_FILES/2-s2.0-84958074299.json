Although often a transient injury, CIN may progress to significant persistent renal impairment, ESRF and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. There are a number of recognised risk factors, although the prediction of CIN, particularly prior to contrast administration, remains challenging. Current interventions are largely centred on the avoidance of dehydration, the withdrawal of nephrotoxic agents and minimisation of contrast load, which has limited efficacy in preventing CIN in vulnerable patients. The unmet clinical need in CIN therefore resides in accurate prediction, effective intervention and rapid detection to prevent adverse cardiorenal outcomes. Each of these areas, particularly predictive risk scoring systems, innovative pharmacological and mechanical interventions and novel biomarkers are currently the subject of intensive research and development that may lead to the future development effective strategies to mitigate the risk of CIN.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Contrast Media", "Coronary Angiography", "Humans", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958074299", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55937999200": {"Name": "Rear R.", "AuthorID": "55937999200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, NIHR, Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Medical School"}, "57213808377": {"Name": "Bell R.M.", "AuthorID": "57213808377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, NIHR, Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Medical School"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-National University of Singapore"}}}
