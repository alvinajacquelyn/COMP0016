Often, new goals require updating conceptual knowledge to reflect relationships based on different goal-relevant features. Here, our aim is to determine how hippocampal (HPC) object representations are organized and updated to reflect changing conceptual knowledge. Participants learned two classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning. Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most critical to the new goal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Category learning", "Computational modeling", "FMRI", "Hippocampus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Brain", "Concept Formation", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995685394", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24765016500": {"Name": "Mack M.", "AuthorID": "24765016500", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Toronto"}, "7102112661": {"Name": "Love B.", "AuthorID": "7102112661", "AffiliationID": "60111768", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute"}, "7102344440": {"Name": "Preston A.", "AuthorID": "7102344440", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas at Austin"}}}
