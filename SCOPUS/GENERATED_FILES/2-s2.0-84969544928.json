Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Surgical Associates Ltd.Introduction Good medical practice dictates that comprehensive documentation of all surgical procedures is paramount in maintaining a high standard of patient care. This study audited the quality of operative note keeping for elective and trauma procedures against the standards set by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSE) guidelines. Patients and methods A retrospective assessment of the operative notes of every patient undergoing a total knee and hip replacement (elective cases) was carried out over a period of 2 months. Data recorded were compared against BOA guidelines. Within this time a randomised selection of trauma operative notes were also assessed, and the recorded data were compared against RCSE guidelines. Change in practice was implemented and the audit cycle completed. A total of 173 operative notes were evaluated. Results There was a significant improvement (p-value < 0.05) in the quality of total knee replacement notes, with an increase in the percentage of data points from 68.6% to 93%. Similarly the quality of total hip replacement notes showed significant improvement (p-value < 0.01) with an increase in the percentage of data points from 67.5% to 86%. However trauma operative notes showed minimal improvement. Discussion This study showed that the quality of elective operative notes was improved through surgeon education and the circulation of a guideline based electronic operative note. We have further plans to implement procedure specific notes for the most common types of trauma cases to help improve the quality of trauma operative notes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audit and feedback", "BOA", "Checklists", "Clinical governance", "Operation notes", "Patient safety", "RCSE", "Trauma and orthopaedics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969544928", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57217325029": {"Name": "Shah P.A.", "AuthorID": "57217325029", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217936407": {"Name": "Badiani R.", "AuthorID": "57217936407", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12141543400": {"Name": "Kalairajah Y.", "AuthorID": "12141543400", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36909794600": {"Name": "Davis B.M.", "AuthorID": "36909794600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Research, Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
