However, the relationship between the organic nature of the cation and the optoelectronic quality remains debated. In this work, we investigate the optoelectronic properties of fully inorganic vapour-deposited and spin-coated black-phase CsPbI3 thin films. Using the time-resolved microwave conductivity technique, we measure charge carrier mobilities up to 25 cm2/(V s) and impressively long charge carrier lifetimes exceeding 10 \u03bcs for vapour-deposited CsPbI3, while the carrier lifetime reaches less than 0.2 \u03bcs in the spin-coated samples. Finally, we show that these improved lifetimes result in enhanced device performance with power conversion efficiencies close to 9%. Altogether, these results suggest that the charge carrier mobility and recombination lifetime are mainly dictated by the inorganic framework rather than the organic nature of the cation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Device performance", "Halide perovskites", "Optoelectronic properties", "Photovoltaic performance", "Photovoltaics", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Recombination lifetime", "Time-resolved microwave conductivity techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033726556", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56767830400": {"Name": "Hutter E.", "AuthorID": "56767830400", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "57196727634": {"Name": "Chandrashekar S.", "AuthorID": "57196727634", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "6701512912": {"Name": "Savenije T.", "AuthorID": "6701512912", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "56868166800": {"Name": "Sutton R.", "AuthorID": "56868166800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "8833978100": {"Name": "Snaith H.", "AuthorID": "8833978100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55864987800": {"Name": "Abdi-Jalebi M.", "AuthorID": "55864987800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "35224069200": {"Name": "Stranks S.", "AuthorID": "35224069200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
