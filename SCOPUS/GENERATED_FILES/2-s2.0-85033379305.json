FEBS Letters published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.Neural networks are optimized to detect temporal coincidence on the millisecond timescale. Here, we offer a synthetic hypothesis based on recent structural insights into SNAREs and the C2 domain proteins to explain how synaptic transmission can keep this pace. We suggest that an outer ring of up to six curved Munc13 \u2018MUN\u2019 domains transiently anchored to the plasma membrane via its flanking domains surrounds a stable inner ring comprised of synaptotagmin C2 domains to serve as a work-bench on which SNAREpins are templated. This \u2018buttressed-ring hypothesis\u2019 affords straightforward answers to many principal and long-standing questions concerning how SNAREpins can be assembled, clamped, and then released synchronously with an action potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["membrane fusion", "SNARE", "synaptic transmission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Nerve Net", "Protein Domains", "SNARE Proteins", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033379305", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7103209478": {"Name": "Rothman J.E.", "AuthorID": "7103209478", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "16245253100": {"Name": "Krishnakumar S.S.", "AuthorID": "16245253100", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "56123598400": {"Name": "Grushin K.", "AuthorID": "56123598400", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "6701374846": {"Name": "Pincet F.", "AuthorID": "6701374846", "AffiliationID": "60000179, 60123796, 60008134, 60005640, 60108665, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Statistique, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, PSL Research University, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s UPMC Univ, CNRS"}}}
