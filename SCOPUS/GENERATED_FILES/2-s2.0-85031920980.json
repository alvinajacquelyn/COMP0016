The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the CANparent Trial of 12 universal parenting programmes, which were made available to parents of all children aged 0-6 years in three local authorities in England. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of universal parenting programmes on this scale. Methods: Parents accessed a voucher, value \u00a3100, to attend an accredited programme of parenting classes. Parents completed measures of their mental well-being, parenting efficacy, parenting satisfaction, and parenting stress, at pre- and post-course. Comparative data were derived from a sample of non-participant parents in 16 local authorities not providing CANparent programmes. A quasi-experimental design was adopted following estimation of propensity scores to balance the two groups on socio-demographic variables. Results: Following their programme, changes in parenting stress were small and nonsignificant (Cohen's d frequency 0.07; intensity, 0.17). Participating parents showed significantly greater improvements than the comparison group for parenting efficacy (0.89) but not parenting satisfaction (-0.01). Mental well-being improved from 0.29 SD below the national norm to the national norm after the course. Parents were overwhelmingly positive about their course (88-94%) but this was lower for improvement in their relationship with their child (74%) and being a better parent (76%). Conclusions: The CANparent Trial demonstrated that universal parenting programmes can be effective in improving parents' sense of parenting efficacy and mental well-being when delivered to the full range of parents in community settings. However, there was no evidence of a reduction in levels of parenting stress; nor was there a significant improvement in satisfaction with being a parent. This is the first study of its kind in the UK; although the results point to a population benefit, more research is needed to determine whether benefits can be maintained in the longer term and whether they will translate into better parenting practices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Parenting", "Parents", "Personal Satisfaction", "Program Evaluation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031920980", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7102841300": {"Name": "Lindsay G.", "AuthorID": "7102841300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick, Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research (CEDAR)"}, "12760208200": {"Name": "Totsika V.", "AuthorID": "12760208200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick, CEDAR and Centre for Education Studies"}}}
