Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in the tertiary hospital. The medical records of critically ill children were reviewed. The data were analyzed for the prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia and outcomes. Results: Two hundred and two patients were included in the analysis. The incidence of hypoalbuminaemia at admission was 57.9%. These patients had a mortality rate 4 times greater (adjusted odds ratio 3.8; 95% CI: 1.4-10.0), a longer length of PICU stay (8.6 vs. 6.7 days, P = 0.04) and a longer period on a ventilator (5.9 vs. 3.9 days, P = 0.04) than patients with normal albumin levels. Conclusions: Hypoalbuminaemia at admission was a predictive factor of poor outcome in critically ill children. It is associated with a higher mortality, a longer length of stay in the PICU, as well as longer ventilator use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical outcomes", "Critically ill children", "Hypoalbuminaemia", "Prediction factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Hypoalbuminemia", "Infant", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Respiration, Artificial", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Analysis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979697510", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57188996144": {"Name": "Kittisakmontri K.", "AuthorID": "57188996144", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition"}, "11440109200": {"Name": "Reungrongrat S.", "AuthorID": "11440109200", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition"}, "16646268100": {"Name": "Lao-araya M.", "AuthorID": "16646268100", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition"}}}
