Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted in 66 clusters across all the 10 provinces of Zambia. Eligible participants aged 15 years and above were screened for TB symptoms, had a chest x-ray (CXR) performed and were offered an HIV test. Participants with TB symptoms and/or CXR abnormality underwent an in-depth interview and submitted one spot- and one morning sputum sample for smear microscopy and liquid culture. Digital data collection methods were used throughout the process. Results: Of the 98,458 individuals who were enumerated, 54,830 (55.7%) were eligible to participate, and 46,099 (84.1%) participated. Of those who participated, 45,633/46,099 (99%) were screened by both symptom assessment and chest x-ray, while 466/46,099 (1.01%) were screened by interview only. 6,708 (14.6%) were eligible to submit sputum and 6,154/6,708 (91.7%) of them submitted at least one specimen for examination. MTB cases identified were 265/6,123 (4.3%). The estimated national adult prevalence of smear, culture and bacteriologically confirmed TB was 319/100,000 (232-406/100,000); 568/100,000 (440-697/100,000); and 638/100,000 (502-774/100,000) population, respectively. The risk of having TB was five times higher in the HIV positive than HIV negative individuals. The TB prevalence for all forms was estimated to be 455/100,000 population for all age groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of tuberculosis in Zambia was higher than previously estimated. Innovative approaches are required to accelerate the control of TB.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Tuberculosis", "Young Adult", "Zambia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955459597", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23992930000": {"Name": "Kapata N.", "AuthorID": "23992930000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Travel Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam"}, "53982461600": {"Name": "Chanda-Kapata P.", "AuthorID": "53982461600", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Travel Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam"}, "56716496700": {"Name": "Ngosa W.", "AuthorID": "56716496700", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health Headquarters"}, "57076891500": {"Name": "Metitiri M.", "AuthorID": "57076891500", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health Headquarters"}, "57076720000": {"Name": "Sakala S.", "AuthorID": "57076720000", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health Headquarters"}, "26429084600": {"Name": "Chizema-Kawesha E.", "AuthorID": "26429084600", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health Headquarters"}, "6603404970": {"Name": "Chikamata D.", "AuthorID": "6603404970", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health Headquarters"}, "8698430400": {"Name": "Klinkenberg E.", "AuthorID": "8698430400", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development"}, "6508102672": {"Name": "Kalisvaart N.", "AuthorID": "6508102672", "AffiliationID": "60024290", "AffiliationName": "KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation"}, "56946934600": {"Name": "Sunkutu V.", "AuthorID": "56946934600", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "55201338200": {"Name": "Shibemba A.", "AuthorID": "55201338200", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "55444254300": {"Name": "Chabala C.", "AuthorID": "55444254300", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "6508160309": {"Name": "Mbulo G.", "AuthorID": "6508160309", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "34973058600": {"Name": "Katemangwe P.", "AuthorID": "34973058600", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "56177544000": {"Name": "Chongwe G.", "AuthorID": "56177544000", "AffiliationID": "60072796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Zambia"}, "24082109000": {"Name": "Tembo M.", "AuthorID": "24082109000", "AffiliationID": "106549564", "AffiliationName": "Tropical Diseases Research Centre"}, "57211546813": {"Name": "Mulenga L.", "AuthorID": "57211546813", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Chest Diseases Laboratory, Ministry of Health"}, "57216327983": {"Name": "Masiye F.", "AuthorID": "57216327983", "AffiliationID": "60072796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zambia"}, "57077008000": {"Name": "Sinyangwe G.", "AuthorID": "57077008000", "AffiliationID": "60008275", "AffiliationName": "United States Agency for International Development"}, "24481465400": {"Name": "Onozaki I.", "AuthorID": "24481465400", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global Tuberculosis Programme, World Health Organisation"}, "56744548100": {"Name": "Mwaba P.", "AuthorID": "56744548100", "AffiliationID": "113802496", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Home Affairs Headquarters"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Department of Infection, University College London"}, "7004891682": {"Name": "Grobusch M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004891682", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Travel Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam"}}}
