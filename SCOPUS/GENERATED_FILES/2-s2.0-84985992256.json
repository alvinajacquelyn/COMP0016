Our primary goal was to develop a standardized procedure for managing and testing patients during and after seizures in EMUs. The secondary goal was to assess whether it could be implemented in clinical practice (feasibility). A taskforce was appointed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)\u2014Commission on European Affairs and the European Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Association, to develop a standardized ictal testing battery (ITB) based on expert opinion and experience with various local testing protocols. ITB contains a comprehensive set of 10 items that evidence the clinically relevant semiologic features, and it is adaptive to the dynamics of the individual seizures. The feasibility of the ITB was prospectively evaluated on 250 seizures from 152 consecutive patients in 10 centers. ITB was successfully implemented in clinical practice in all 10 participating centers and was considered feasible in 93% of the tested seizures. ITB was not feasible for testing seizures of very short duration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy monitoring unit", "Feasibility", "Postictal", "Seizures", "Semiology", "Testing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985992256", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7801623846": {"Name": "Beniczky S.", "AuthorID": "7801623846", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University"}, "7004871713": {"Name": "Neufeld M.", "AuthorID": "7004871713", "AffiliationID": "60008870", "AffiliationName": "The EEG and Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neurology, Tel Aviv Medical Center"}, "57207734376": {"Name": "Lebedinsky A.", "AuthorID": "57207734376", "AffiliationID": "60008870", "AffiliationName": "The EEG and Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neurology, Tel Aviv Medical Center"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical Neurophysiology and Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}, "12761225500": {"Name": "Dobesberger J.", "AuthorID": "12761225500", "AffiliationID": "60014976, 60025799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian-Doppler-Klinik, Paracelsus Medical University, and Center for Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "54917691600": {"Name": "Trinka E.", "AuthorID": "54917691600", "AffiliationID": "60014976, 60025799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian-Doppler-Klinik, Paracelsus Medical University, and Center for Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "11540710400": {"Name": "Mameniskiene R.", "AuthorID": "11540710400", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vilnius University Hospital"}, "24339474300": {"Name": "Rheims S.", "AuthorID": "24339474300", "AffiliationID": "60023578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Functional Neurology and Epileptology, University Hospital of Lyon and Lyon 1 University"}, "56014143000": {"Name": "Gil-Nagel A.", "AuthorID": "56014143000", "AffiliationID": "60024343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Epilepsy Program, Hospital Ruber Internacional"}, "15051482700": {"Name": "Craiu D.", "AuthorID": "15051482700", "AffiliationID": "60033150, 60091076", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences (No. 6), Pediatric Neurology Clinic, Alexandru Obregia Hospital, \u201cCarol Davila\u201d University of Medicine"}, "6602252366": {"Name": "Pressler R.", "AuthorID": "6602252366", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6504321167": {"Name": "Krysl D.", "AuthorID": "6504321167", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7004879112": {"Name": "Tassi L.", "AuthorID": "7004879112", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "\u201cClaudio Munari\u201d Epilepsy Surgery Center, Niguarda Hospital"}, "7006617727": {"Name": "Rubboli G.", "AuthorID": "7006617727", "AffiliationID": "60095448, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Danish Epilepsy Center and University of Copenhagen"}, "7004135382": {"Name": "Ryvlin P.", "AuthorID": "7004135382", "AffiliationID": "117045228", "AffiliationName": "European Epilepsy Monitoring Association"}}}
