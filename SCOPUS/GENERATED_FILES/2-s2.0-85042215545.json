Kidney Dis.", "Volume": "72", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 62, "PageEnd": 74, "CitedBy": 17, "DOI": "10.1053/j.ajkd.2017.11.010", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042215545&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.Background: Clinical trials are most informative for evidence-based decision making when they consistently measure and report outcomes of relevance to stakeholders. We aimed to assess the scope and consistency of outcomes reported in trials for hemodialysis. Study Design: Systematic review. Setting & Population: Adults requiring maintenance hemodialysis enrolled in clinical trials. Selection Criteria: All Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions published by August 29, 2016, and the trials published and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov since January 2011. Interventions: Any hemodialysis-related interventions. Outcomes: Frequency and characteristics of the reported outcome domains and measures. Results: From the 362 trials, we extracted and classified 10,713 outcome measures (a median of 21 [IQR, 10-39] per trial) into 81 different outcome domains, of which 42 (52%) were surrogate; 25 (31%), clinical; and 14 (17%), patient reported. The number of outcome measures reported significantly changed over time. The 5 most commonly reported domains were all surrogates: phosphate (125 [35%] trials), dialysis adequacy (120 [33%]), anemia (115 [32%]), inflammatory markers (114 [31%]), and calcium (109 [30%]). Mortality, cardiovascular diseases, and quality of life were reported very infrequently (73 [20%], 44 [12%], and 32 [9%], respectively). Limitations: For feasibility, we included a sampling frame that included only trials identified in Cochrane systematic reviews or ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusions: Outcomes reported in clinical trials involving adults receiving hemodialysis are focused on surrogate outcomes, rather than clinical and patient-centered outcomes. There is also extreme multiplicity and heterogeneity at every level: domain, measure, metric, and time point. Estimates of the comparative effectiveness of available interventions are unreliable and improvements over time have been inconsistent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["core outcomes", "Hemodialysis", "nephrology", "outcomes", "patient-centered outcomes", "study quality", "surrogate outcome", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Renal Dialysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042215545", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"36635057700": {"Name": "Sautenet B.", "AuthorID": "36635057700", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1246"}, "23020354400": {"Name": "Tong A.", "AuthorID": "23020354400", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead"}, "55469187000": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "55469187000", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead"}, "56850401300": {"Name": "Evangelidis N.", "AuthorID": "56850401300", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead"}, "8686296400": {"Name": "Howard K.", "AuthorID": "8686296400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney"}, "57191031347": {"Name": "Ju A.", "AuthorID": "57191031347", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead"}, "7401926037": {"Name": "Craig J.C.", "AuthorID": "7401926037", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead"}, "6701582254": {"Name": "Hemmelgarn B.R.", "AuthorID": "6701582254", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "7004680663": {"Name": "Manns B.", "AuthorID": "7004680663", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "35374403700": {"Name": "Tugwell P.", "AuthorID": "35374403700", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "7003620625": {"Name": "van Biesen W.", "AuthorID": "7003620625", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Renal Division, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7003558140": {"Name": "Winkelmayer W.C.", "AuthorID": "7003558140", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Selzman Institute for Kidney Health, Section of Nephrology, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "36088780600": {"Name": "Crowe S.", "AuthorID": "36088780600", "AffiliationID": "118144663", "AffiliationName": "Crowe Associates"}, "56562357300": {"Name": "Harris T.", "AuthorID": "56562357300", "AffiliationID": "115395471", "AffiliationName": "PKD International"}, "57211144379": {"Name": "Hawley C.M.", "AuthorID": "57211144379", "AffiliationID": "115196865", "AffiliationName": "Metro South and Ipswich Nephrology and Transplant Services (MINTS)"}, "34975083900": {"Name": "Johnson D.W.", "AuthorID": "34975083900", "AffiliationID": "115196865", "AffiliationName": "Metro South and Ipswich Nephrology and Transplant Services (MINTS)"}, "7102646018": {"Name": "Pollock C.", "AuthorID": "7102646018", "AffiliationID": "60011192", "AffiliationName": "Renal Division, Kolling Institute"}, "6601997825": {"Name": "Polkinghorne K.R.", "AuthorID": "6601997825", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Preventative Medicine, Monash University"}, "24473166400": {"Name": "Kerr P.G.", "AuthorID": "24473166400", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Preventative Medicine, Monash University"}, "8682810400": {"Name": "Gallagher M.P.", "AuthorID": "8682810400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Concord Clinical School, The University of Sydney"}, "7202569609": {"Name": "McDonald S.P.", "AuthorID": "7202569609", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide"}}}
