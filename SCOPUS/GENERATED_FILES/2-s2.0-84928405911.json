It enables us to reason under uncertainty and addresses shortcomings underlying deterministic systems and control theories which do not provide sufficient means of performing analysis and design. In addition, parametric techniques such as the Kalman filter and its extensions, though they are computationally efficient, do not reliably compute states and cannot be used to learn stochastic problems. We review recursive Bayesian estimation using sequential Monte Carlo methods highlighting open problems. Primary of these is the weight degeneracy and sample impoverishment problem. We proceed to detail synergistic computational intelligence sequential Monte Carlo methods which address this. We find that imbuing sequential Monte Carlos with computational intelligence has many advantages when applied to many application and problem domains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian filtering", "computational intelligence", "Sequential Monte Carlo"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928405911", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55369200000": {"Name": "Hanif A.", "AuthorID": "55369200000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55727407500": {"Name": "Smith R.E.", "AuthorID": "55727407500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
