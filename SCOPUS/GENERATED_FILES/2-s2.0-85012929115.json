This study investigated the baseline characteristics and survival in the cohort of patients diagnosed with PoPH in the United Kingdom National Pulmonary Hypertension Service. Methods A retrospective review was conducted of all incident treatment-na\u00efve patients with PoPH within the United Kingdom national registry diagnosed between January 2001 and December 2010. Results Patients with PoPH (n = 110) had survival rates of 85%, 60%, and 35% at 1, 3, and 5 years. The prevalence of PoPH was 0.85 cases/1 million. Mean age at diagnosis was 53 \u00b1 12 years, with a balanced distribution in gender. Alcohol (n = 57) and hepatitis C (n = 10) were the most common causes of portal hypertension. Phosphodiesterase V inhibitors were the most frequently used targeted therapy, in 63.6% (n = 70) of patients, endothelin receptor antagonists were used in 10% (n = 11) and prostacyclin analogs in 12.7% (n = 14). Univariate and multivariate analysis of baseline characteristics did not demonstrate a significant influence of severity of portal hypertension or liver cirrhosis, World Health Organization Functional Class, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, or year of diagnosis on survival. Conclusions Survival of patients with PoPH remains poor despite targeted therapy and worse than patients with idiopathic PAH. The benefit of PAH therapies in PoPH on long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes needs further consideration and study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PAH-targeted treatment", "portal hypertension", "portopulmonary hypertension", "pulmonary arterial hypertension", "survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Portal", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012929115", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6505570341": {"Name": "Sithamparanathan S.", "AuthorID": "6505570341", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57193319768": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "57193319768", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "National Pulmonary Hypertension Service (Newcastle), The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55649839400": {"Name": "Thirugnanasothy L.", "AuthorID": "55649839400", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "55898040900": {"Name": "Fisher A.J.", "AuthorID": "55898040900", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "6603077452": {"Name": "Lordan J.L.", "AuthorID": "6603077452", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "35232813500": {"Name": "Corris P.A.", "AuthorID": "35232813500", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "35393553500": {"Name": "Coghlan J.G.", "AuthorID": "35393553500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary Hypertension Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57193314224": {"Name": "E.
