Population-based prevalence estimates of bivalent (HPV-16/18), quadrivalent (HPV-6/11/16/18) and 9-valent (HPV-6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) vaccine types, and comparison over time, are needed to monitor impact, evaluate effectiveness and guide decision-making on vaccination strategies. Methods The third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) in 2010-12, tested urine for HPV from 2569 sexually-experienced women aged 16\u201344. We report type-specific HPV prevalence and compare results with 1798 women in Natsal-2 (1999\u20132001) using age-adjusted prevalence ratios (APR). Findings In Natsal-3, 4.2% of women aged 16-44y were positive for HPV\u201016/18 and 2.9% for HPV-6/11. In 16\u201320 year olds, 4.5%, 10.8% and 20.7% had at least one bivalent, quadrivalent or 9-valent vaccine type, respectively. Three-dose vaccine coverage was 52.0% in women aged 18-20y. In this age group, HPV-16/18 prevalence was lower in Natsal-3 than Natsal-2 (5.8% vs 11.2%; APR=0.48[95%CI: 0.24\u20130.93]), however, prevalences of HPV-6/11, HPV-31/33/45 and HPV-52/58 were unchanged. HPV-16/18 prevalence was also unchanged in women aged 21-44y (APR=0.85[0.61\u20131.19]). Interpretation These probability surveys provide evidence of the impact of the bivalent immunisation programme. Reductions were specific to HPV-16/18 and to the age group eligible for vaccination. However, substantial vaccine-preventable HPV remains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HPV", "HPV vaccine", "Immunisation programme", "Prevalence", "Probability sample survey", "Women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009843967", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"24069384200": {"Name": "Tanton C.", "AuthorID": "24069384200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen Social Research"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "13805527900": {"Name": "Mesher D.", "AuthorID": "13805527900", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "6701456519": {"Name": "Soldan K.", "AuthorID": "6701456519", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "6601961353": {"Name": "Beddows S.", "AuthorID": "6601961353", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "55923872800": {"Name": "Panwar K.", "AuthorID": "55923872800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}}}
