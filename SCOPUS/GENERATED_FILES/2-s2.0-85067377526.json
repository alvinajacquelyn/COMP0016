Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) mostly has its disease onset in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and usually presents with predominant bulbar and axial dystonia along with signs such as spasticity, indicating an involvement of additional neurological systems. Because of their early onset and presentation with a combination of dystonia plus other neurological symptoms, they are usually not considered as differential diagnosis for late-onset isolated (idiopathic) craniocervical dystonia. In this case series, we present 4 genetically proven cases of NBIA (including neuroferritinopathy, pantothenate-kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and aceruloplasminemia) with late disease onset, which resembled isolated adult-onset craniocervical dystonia at disease onset. We also want to highlight the importance of taking NBIA into consideration when dealing with putatively isolated late-onset dystonias and of picking up unusual signs at later stages of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["craniocervical dystonia", "isolated dystonia", "NBIA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067377526", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56511870900": {"Name": "Brugger F.", "AuthorID": "56511870900", "AffiliationID": "60022646", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen"}, "57190871612": {"Name": "K\u00e4gi G.", "AuthorID": "57190871612", "AffiliationID": "60022646", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen"}, "36450181000": {"Name": "Batla A.", "AuthorID": "36450181000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005806146": {"Name": "Pandolfo M.", "AuthorID": "7005806146", "AffiliationID": "60068575, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, H\u00f4pital Erasme, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "35176436700": {"Name": "Mencacci N.E.", "AuthorID": "35176436700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "12753849900": {"Name": "Wiethoff S.", "AuthorID": "12753849900", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurology and Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, Eberhard-Karls-University"}}}
