The CL41, CL42 and CL2r50 oxidation is a complex, pH-dependent irreversible process involving the formation of electroactive products that undergo two consecutive reversible oxidation reactions. The DNA interaction with CL41, CL42 and CL2r50 was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry using the dsDNA-electrochemical biosensor and in DNA/trisubstituted triazole incubated solutions. All three trisubstituted triazole-linked phenyl derivatives interacted with dsDNA causing morphological and oxidative damage to the dsDNA structure in a time-dependent manner. The DNA-electrochemical biosensor enabled the detection of oxidative damage to DNA following the occurrence of the 8-oxoGua and/or 2,8-oxoAde oxidation peaks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DsDNA electrochemical biosensor", "Glassy carbon electrode", "Substituted triazole-linked phenyl compounds", "Voltammetry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Differential pulse voltammetry", "Electrochemical biosensor", "Electrochemical evaluations", "Glassy carbon electrodes", "Irreversible process", "Phenyl compounds", "Reversible oxidation", "Square wave voltammetry", "Acridines", "Biosensing Techniques", "Carbon", "DNA", "Electrochemical Techniques", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Solutions", "Triazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949115149", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"25724565300": {"Name": "Pontinha A.", "AuthorID": "25724565300", "AffiliationID": "60020985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Coimbra"}, "7006682748": {"Name": "Oliveira-Brett A.", "AuthorID": "7006682748", "AffiliationID": "60020985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Coimbra"}, "56406676500": {"Name": "Lombardo C.", "AuthorID": "56406676500", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
