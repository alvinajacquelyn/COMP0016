Karger AG, Basel.Aim: To examine the association between a healthy diet, assessed by the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), and cognitive decline in older adults. Methods: Data from 21,837 participants aged \u226555 years from 3 cohorts (Survey in Europe on Nutrition and the Elderly, a Concerted Action [SENECA], Rotterdam Study [RS], Nurses' Health Study [NHS]) were analyzed. HDI scores were based on intakes of saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, protein, cholesterol, fruits and vegetables, and fiber. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in NHS and Mini-Mental State Examination in RS and SENECA were used to assess cognitive function from multiple repeated measures. Using multivariable-adjusted, mixed linear regression, mean differences in annual rates of cognitive decline by HDI quintiles were estimated. Results: Multivariable-adjusted differences in rates in the highest versus the lowest HDI quintile were 0.01 (95% CI -0.01, 0.02) in NHS, 0.00 (95% CI -0.02, 0.01) in RS, and 0.00 (95% CI -0.05, 0.05) in SENECA with a pooled estimate of 0.00 (95% CI -0.01, 0.01), I2 = 0%. Conclusions: A higher HDI score was not related to reduced rates of cognitive decline in European and American older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "CHANCES", "Cognition", "Cohort", "Diet", "Epidemiology", "Healthy Diet Indicator", "Nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Healthy Diet", "Humans", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015874046", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56612314900": {"Name": "Berendsen A.A.M.", "AuthorID": "56612314900", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University and Research"}, "57202223277": {"Name": "Van De Rest O.", "AuthorID": "57202223277", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University and Research"}, "7003958833": {"Name": "Kampman E.", "AuthorID": "7003958833", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University and Research"}, "7005435520": {"Name": "Feskens E.J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005435520", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University and Research"}, "57201764683": {"Name": "De Groot L.C.P.G.M.", "AuthorID": "57201764683", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University and Research"}, "35976132500": {"Name": "Kang J.H.", "AuthorID": "35976132500", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60010869, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7004975779": {"Name": "Grodstein F.", "AuthorID": "7004975779", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.
