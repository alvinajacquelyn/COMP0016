One-hundred adult participants completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaire. Twenty participants from the top quintile and 20 participants from the bottom quintile of the EQ distribution took part in a laboratory experiment. In the experiment, a classical Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) was induced followed by the presentation of a series of painful stimuli to the rubber hand. Participants were asked to self-rate the strength of their subjective experience of the RHI and of the illusory pain. A proprioceptive location judgment on the position of the hidden hand was also required before and after RHI induction, to record drifts towards the rubber hand. We found a significant difference between high- and low-empathy participants in RHI and pain score. The EQ was not related with the proprioceptive location judgement drift. It thus appears to be a better predictor of subjective ownership feelings and phenomenological self-other merging than of the behavioural components of bodily illusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Empathy quotient", "Extreme female brain", "Illusory pain", "Mirror-touch synaesthesia", "Rubber hand illusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921054294", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56483263500": {"Name": "Seiryte A.", "AuthorID": "56483263500", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology, Abertay University"}, "6506974676": {"Name": "Rusconi E.", "AuthorID": "6506974676", "AffiliationID": "60004969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of Parma"}}}
