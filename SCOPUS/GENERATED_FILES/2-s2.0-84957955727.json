We aimed to investigate the biological and psychosocial risk factors associated with PMD compared with other psychotic disorders. Methods: Based on the aetiology and ethnicity in schizophrenia and other psychoses (\u00c6SOP) study, we used a case\u2013control study to identify and recruit, at baseline and 10-year follow-up, all first episode cases of psychosis, presenting for the first time to specialist mental health services in defined catchment areas in the UK. Population-based controls were recruited from the same areas. Data were collected on: sociodemographics; social isolation; childhood adversity; life events; minor physical anomalies; and neurological soft signs. Results: Living alone (aOR = 2.26, CI = 1.21\u20134.23), basic level qualification (aOR = 2.89, CI = 1.08\u20137.74), being unemployed (aOR = 2.12, CI = 1.13\u20133.96), having contact with friends less than monthly (aOR = 4.24, CI = 1.62\u201311.14), having no close confidants (aOR = 4.71, CI = 2.08\u201310.68), having experienced childhood adversity (aOR = 2.57, CI = 1.02\u20136.44), family history of mental illness (aOR = 10.68, CI = 5.06\u201322.52), family history of psychosis (aOR = 12.85, CI = 5.24\u201331.51), and having more neurological soft signs (aOR = 1.15, CI = 1.07\u20131.24) were all associated with a follow-up diagnosis of PMD and schizophrenia. Few variables associated with PMD were also associated with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Minor physical anomalies were associated with a follow-up diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but not PMD. Conclusions: Risk factors associated with PMD appear to overlap with those for schizophrenia, but less so for bipolar disorder. Future work on the differential aetiology of PMD, from other psychoses is needed to find the \u2018specifier\u2019 between PMD and other psychoses. Future research on aetiology in PMD, and perhaps other psychoses, should account for diagnostic change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "Epidemiology", "Psychosis", "Risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bipolar Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotic Disorders", "Risk Factors", "Schizophrenia", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957955727", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24829277200": {"Name": "Heslin M.", "AuthorID": "24829277200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "56927711900": {"Name": "Desai R.", "AuthorID": "56927711900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35236939500": {"Name": "Donoghue K.", "AuthorID": "35236939500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35796165100": {"Name": "Reininghaus U.", "AuthorID": "35796165100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University"}, "56062418800": {"Name": "Onyejiaka A.", "AuthorID": "56062418800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602196376": {"Name": "Dazzan P.", "AuthorID": "6602196376", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9235818300": {"Name": "Fisher H.L.", "AuthorID": "9235818300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "23970361800": {"Name": "Demjaha A.", "AuthorID": "23970361800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "55243134200": {"Name": "Craig T.", "AuthorID": "55243134200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "55608671400": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "55608671400", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "11839740300": {"Name": "Lappin J.M.", "AuthorID": "11839740300", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "University of New South Wales"}, "7003912129": {"Name": "Lomas B.", "AuthorID": "7003912129", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "6701516800": {"Name": "Doody G.A.", "AuthorID": "6701516800", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "6603726577": {"Name": "Croudace T.", "AuthorID": "6603726577", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "University of Dundee"}, "56489064900": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "56489064900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "7003273960": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273960", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity College"}}}
