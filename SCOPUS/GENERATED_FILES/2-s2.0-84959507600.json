Objectives To compare the S-ICD efficacy of defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing, arrhythmia therapy, and complications in HCM versus non-HCM patients. Methods Outcomes of patients with HCM implanted with S-ICD were compared to non-HCM S-ICD recipients using pooled data from a total of 872 subjects enrolled in the EFFORTLESS Registry and US IDE study. Results The cohort included 99 HCM (75% male) and 773 non-HCM (72% male) patients with a median follow-up of 637 days. The HCM cohort was younger and more likely to receive a primary-prevention S-ICD (88.5% vs 67.5%, P <.0001). During implant testing, successful defibrillation at \u226480 J was achieved in 98.9% of HCM and 98.5% of non-HCM patients. One year postoperative complication-free rates were similar: 92.7% in HCM (with no lead complications) versus 89.5% in non-HCM. There were 3 appropriate shocks for ventricular tachycardia in 3 HCM patients that were all converted by the first shock. Overall final shock conversion efficacy was 100% in HCM versus 98% in non-HCM (P = ns). Inappropriate shocks occurred in 12.5% of HCM patients and 10.3% of non-HCM patients (P = ns), being reduced by 47% using dual-zone programming. Conclusion These initial data indicate the S-ICD is safe and effective in patients with HCM who are at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and pass preimplantation electrocardiogram screening. Inappropriate shocks were mainly due to T-wave oversensing, but there were no lead complications requiring reintervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Subcutaneous ICD", "Ventricular arrhythmias"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electric Countershock", "Electrocardiography", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Primary Prevention", "Registries", "Tachycardia, Ventricular", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959507600", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, UCL, Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7402444113": {"Name": "Gold M.R.", "AuthorID": "7402444113", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina"}, "7006920090": {"Name": "Hood M.", "AuthorID": "7006920090", "AffiliationID": "60011750", "AffiliationName": "Auckland City Hospital"}, "7004921270": {"Name": "Boersma L.", "AuthorID": "7004921270", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "St Antonius Ziekenhuis"}, "6603638449": {"Name": "Theuns D.A.M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603638449", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus Medical Center"}, "7402868775": {"Name": "Burke M.C.", "AuthorID": "7402868775", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Heart Rhythm Center, University of Chicago"}, "7404027538": {"Name": "Weiss R.", "AuthorID": "7404027538", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Ohio State University"}, "56502926500": {"Name": "Russo A.M.", "AuthorID": "56502926500", "AffiliationID": "60017662", "AffiliationName": "Cooper University Hospital"}, "6701523625": {"Name": "K\u00e4\u00e4b S.", "AuthorID": "6701523625", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Grosshadern, University of Munich"}, "7201940628": {"Name": "Knight B.P.", "AuthorID": "7201940628", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}}}
