Diagnosis is often difficult but early treatment is important in reducing the risk of associated morbidity and poor outcomes. Myositis specific autoantibodies have been described in both juvenile and adult patients with myositis and can be helpful in dividing patients into clinically homogenous groups. We aimed to explore the utility of myositis specific autoantibodies as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with juvenile-onset disease. Methods Using radio-labelled immunoprecipitation and previously validated ELISAs we examined the presence of myositis specific autoantibodies in 380 patients with juvenile-onset myositis in addition to, 318 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 21 patients with juvenile-onset SLE, 27 patients with muscular dystrophies, and 48 healthy children. Results An autoantibody was identified in 60% of juvenile-onset myositis patients. Myositis specific autoantibodies (49% patients) were exclusively found in patients with myositis and with the exception of one case were mutually exclusive and not found in conjunction with another autoantibody. Autoantibody subtypes were associated with age at disease onset, key clinical disease features and treatment received. Conclusions In juvenile patients the identification of a myositis specific autoantibody is highly suggestive of myositis. Autoantibodies can be identified in the majority of affected children and provide useful prognostic information. There is evidence of a differential treatment approach and patients with anti-TIF1\u03b3 autoantibodies are significantly more likely to receive aggressive treatment with IV cyclophosphamide and/or biologic drugs, clear trends are also visible in other autoantibody subgroups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoantibody", "Autoimmune disease", "Myopathy", "Myositis", "Paediatric rheumatology", "Phenotype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autoantibodies", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cyclophosphamide", "Dermatomyositis", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Male", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Transcription Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021144635", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"26647124900": {"Name": "Tansley S.L.", "AuthorID": "26647124900", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "16936030100": {"Name": "McHugh N.J.", "AuthorID": "16936030100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "18834012300": {"Name": "Betteridge Z.E.", "AuthorID": "18834012300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "57191344710": {"Name": "Simou S.", "AuthorID": "57191344710", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, UCLH and GOSH"}, "24536672900": {"Name": "Almeida B.", "AuthorID": "24536672900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "7004250589": {"Name": "Wedderburn L.R.", "AuthorID": "7004250589", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, UCLH and GOSH"}, "57216802010": {"Name": "Shaddick G.", "AuthorID": "57216802010", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Bath"}, "56627348800": {"Name": "Gunawardena H.", "AuthorID": "56627348800", "AffiliationID": "60016447, 60027676", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Academic Rheumatology, North Bristol NHS Trust, Southmead Hospital"}, "7201689098": {"Name": "Thomson W.", "AuthorID": "7201689098", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60120605, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre Genetics and Genomics, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester and NIHR Manchester Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603662700": {"Name": "Beresford M.W.", "AuthorID": "6603662700", "AffiliationID": "118682725", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Experimental Arthritis Treatment Centre for Children"}, "30067804800": {"Name": "Midgley A.", "AuthorID": "30067804800", "AffiliationID": "118682725", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Experimental Arthritis Treatment Centre for Children"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neuroscience Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
