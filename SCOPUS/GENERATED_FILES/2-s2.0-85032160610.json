Here we explore the possibility that mixed-group housing of mice carrying a deletion of Nlgn3, a gene associated with autism spectrum disorders, and their wild-type littermates induces changes in each other\u2019s behavior. We have found that, when raised together, male Nlgn3 knockout mice and their wild-type littermates displayed deficits in sociability. Moreover, social submission in adult male Nlgn3 knockout mice correlated with an increase in their anxiety. Re-expression of Nlgn3 in parvalbumin-expressing cells in transgenic animals rescued their social behavior and alleviated the phenotype of their wild-type littermates, further indicating that the social behavior of Nlgn3 knockout mice has a direct and measurable impact on wild-type animals\u2019 behavior. Finally, we showed that, unlike male mice, female mice lacking Nlgn3 were insensitive to their peers\u2019 behavior but modified the social behavior of their littermates. Altogether, our findings show that the environment is a critical factor in the development of behavioral phenotypes in transgenic and wild-type mice. In addition, these results reveal that the social environment has a sexually dimorphic effect on the behavior of mice lacking Nlgn3, being more influential in males than females.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorders", "Neuroligin", "Parvalbumin interneurons", "Social behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal", "Cytochrome P450 Family 2", "Exploratory Behavior", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Parvalbumins", "RNA, Messenger", "Sex Characteristics", "Social Behavior", "Testosterone", "Vocalization, Animal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032160610", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57196177609": {"Name": "Kalbassi S.", "AuthorID": "57196177609", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "57196177370": {"Name": "Bachmann S.O.", "AuthorID": "57196177370", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "56899275400": {"Name": "Cross E.", "AuthorID": "56899275400", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55356430100": {"Name": "Roberton V.H.", "AuthorID": "55356430100", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55808361900": {"Name": "Baudouin S.J.", "AuthorID": "55808361900", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}}}
