Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Abstract: Drawing on data from a project exploring children's and adults\u2019 friendships across social class and ethnic difference, this paper focuses on the enactment of national and institutional policy around children\u2019s friendships as realized in three primary schools in diverse urban areas in London. Through a focus on the way in which social and emotional learning (SEL) and teachers\u2019 understandings of children\u2019s friendships seek to govern children\u2019s friendship behaviours, we turn to Foucault\u2019s work to explore how power shapes relations between policy frameworks and teachers\u2019 practices, and between those who teach and those who are taught. We discuss the disciplinary potential of SEL and teachers\u2019 \u2018common sense\u2019 understandings of children\u2019s friendships, but conclude by noting possibilities for teachers to create spaces in which all children can safely explore the nature of friendships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children\u2019s friendships", "diversity", "Foucault", "policy enactment", "social and emotional learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954501431", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7202132753": {"Name": "Vincent C.", "AuthorID": "7202132753", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}, "35834079600": {"Name": "Neal S.", "AuthorID": "35834079600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Surrey"}, "57062268300": {"Name": "Iqbal H.", "AuthorID": "57062268300", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
