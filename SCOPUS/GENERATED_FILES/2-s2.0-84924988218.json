Methods Review of literature. Results Present clinical studies of OEC transplantation have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the technique, and no significant complications have occurred from harvest of the olfactory mucosa to culture OECs. These reported studies have not been designed to determine whether clinical outcome is improved by transplantation. Conclusions OEC transplantation strategies need to be studied further. At present clinical models for testing OECs vary in methodology and quality, and until high-quality, well-designed, and sufficiently powered studies have been performed, the true effect of OEC treatment for patients will remain unclear.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trial", "Olfactory ensheathing cell", "Spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cadaver", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Olfactory Mucosa", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Tissue and Organ Harvesting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924988218", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56215684400": {"Name": "Gladwin K.", "AuthorID": "56215684400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
