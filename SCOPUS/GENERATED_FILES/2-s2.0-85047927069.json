However, contemporary data on nephrotoxicity are lacking. We determined the renal outcomes of patients commenced on TDF ART in Malawi. ART-na\u00efve patients initiated on TDF ART at a community health centre between 1 July 2013 and 31 December 2015 were included. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, Cockcroft-Gault) was recorded at the initiation of therapy and over 18 months thereafter. The prevalence of renal impairment at ART initiation (eGFR < 60 ml/min) and the incidence of nephrotoxicity (eGFR < 50 ml/min) were determined. A total of 439 patients (median age: 32 years; 317 [72.2%] female) were included. Twenty-one (4.8%) patients had renal impairment at ART initiation; eGFR improved in all during follow-up. Nephrotoxicity occurred in 17 (4.0%) patients with eGFR > 50 ml/min at baseline, predominantly within the first six months of therapy. Increasing age and diastolic hypertension (>100 mmHg) were independent risk factors for nephrotoxicity development. The prevalence of kidney disease at ART initiation was 4.8% and nephrotoxicity occurred in 4.0%. Some eGFR decline may have been due to weight gain. Targeted monitoring of kidney function six months after TDF initiation should be considered in Malawi.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute kidney injury", "chronic kidney disease", "HIV", "nephrotoxicity", "tenofovir disoproxil fumarate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Cohort Studies", "Community Health Centers", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Incidence", "Malawi", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renal Insufficiency", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Tenofovir"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047927069", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57202340324": {"Name": "Chikwapulo B.", "AuthorID": "57202340324", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, University of Malawi College of Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre"}, "6602904261": {"Name": "Ngwira B.", "AuthorID": "6602904261", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "55347366100": {"Name": "Sagno J.", "AuthorID": "55347366100", "AffiliationID": "120789578", "AffiliationName": "Mandala Dream Centre Clinic"}, "56080416300": {"Name": "Evans R.", "AuthorID": "56080416300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}}}
