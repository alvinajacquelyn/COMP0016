They promote the conversion of sugars to lipids, but beyond this, their physiological roles are insufficiently understood. Here, we demonstrate that in an organism-wide setting in Drosophila, Mondo-Mlx controls the majority of sugar-regulated genes involved in nutrient digestion and transport as well as carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, human orthologs of the Mondo-Mlx targets display enrichment among gene variants associated with high circulating triglycerides. In addition to direct regulation of metabolic genes, Mondo-Mlx maintains metabolic homeostasis through downstream effectors, including the Activin ligand Dawdle and the Gli-similar transcription factor Sugarbabe. Sugarbabe controls a subset of Mondo-Mlx-dependent processes, including de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid desaturation. In sum, Mondo-Mlx is a master regulator of other sugar-responsive pathways essential for adaptation to a high-sugar diet.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "Carbohydrate Metabolism", "Carrier Proteins", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Lipid Metabolism", "Nuclear Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptional Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944067984", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"23978515800": {"Name": "Mattila J.", "AuthorID": "23978515800", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "DKFZ"}, "55082015200": {"Name": "Havula E.", "AuthorID": "55082015200", "AffiliationID": "60022076, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki"}, "56901056700": {"Name": "Suominen E.", "AuthorID": "56901056700", "AffiliationID": "60022076, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki"}, "55669433100": {"Name": "Teesalu M.", "AuthorID": "55669433100", "AffiliationID": "60022076, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki"}, "8873171200": {"Name": "Hynynen R.", "AuthorID": "8873171200", "AffiliationID": "60022076, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki"}, "56901014500": {"Name": "V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen J.", "AuthorID": "56901014500", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki"}, "57194376249": {"Name": "Hovatta I.", "AuthorID": "57194376249", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "6701681049": {"Name": "K\u00e4kel\u00e4 R.", "AuthorID": "6701681049", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki"}, "6506466733": {"Name": "Hietakangas V.", "AuthorID": "6506466733", "AffiliationID": "60022076, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki"}, "26654479000": {"Name": "Surakka I.", "AuthorID": "26654479000", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "6603009457": {"Name": "Ripatti S.", "AuthorID": "6603009457", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "16175660200": {"Name": "Kilpinen H.", "AuthorID": "16175660200", "AffiliationID": "60026124", "AffiliationName": "EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "13611664100": {"Name": "Sandmann T.", "AuthorID": "13611664100", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Genentech Inc."}}}
