Here, we describe the H1.2 linker histone as a major pRb interaction partner. We establish that H1.2 and pRb are found in a chromatin-bound complex on diverse E2F target genes. Interrogating the global influence of H1.2 on the genome-wide distribution of pRb indicated that the E2F target genes affected by H1.2 are functionally linked to cell-cycle control, consistent with the ability of H1.2 to hinder cell proliferation and the elevated levels of chromatin-bound H1-pRb complex, which occur in growth-arrested cells. Our results define a network of E2F target genes as susceptible to the regulatory influence of H1.2, where H1.2 augments global association of pRb with chromatin, enhances transcriptional repression by pRb, and facilitates pRb-dependent cell-cycle arrest.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell cycle", "chromatin", "E2F", "linker histone", "retinoblastoma protein", "transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Chromatin", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor", "Histones", "Humans", "Retinoblastoma", "Retinoblastoma Protein", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020743883", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"12809027800": {"Name": "Munro S.", "AuthorID": "12809027800", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Medical Sciences Division, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus Research Building, Old Road Campus"}, "56269857600": {"Name": "Floderer M.", "AuthorID": "56269857600", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Medical Sciences Division, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus Research Building, Old Road Campus"}, "27168712600": {"Name": "Carr S.M.", "AuthorID": "27168712600", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Medical Sciences Division, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus Research Building, Old Road Campus"}, "7005139639": {"Name": "La Thangue N.B.", "AuthorID": "7005139639", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Medical Sciences Division, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus Research Building, Old Road Campus"}, "56431060500": {"Name": "Hookway E.S.", "AuthorID": "56431060500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7006473645": {"Name": "Oppermann U.", "AuthorID": "7006473645", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "16245229900": {"Name": "Konietzny R.", "AuthorID": "16245229900", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Roosevelt Drive"}, "7006505495": {"Name": "Kessler B.M.", "AuthorID": "7006505495", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Target Discovery Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Roosevelt Drive"}}}
