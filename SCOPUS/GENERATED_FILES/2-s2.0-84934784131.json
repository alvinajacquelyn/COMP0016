However, for the important platform offered by spins of donor atoms in cryogenically cooled silicon, decoherence mechanisms of Si29 proximate nuclear spins are not yet well understood. The reason is partly because proximate spins lie within a so-called \"frozen core\" region where the donor electronic hyperfine interaction strongly suppresses nuclear dynamics. We investigate the decoherence of a central proximate nuclear qubit arising from quantum spin baths outside, as well as inside, the frozen core around the donor electron. We consider the effect of a very large nuclear spin bath comprising many (108) weakly contributing pairs outside the frozen core (the \"far bath\"). We also propose that there may be an important contribution from a few (of order 100) symmetrically sited nuclear spin pairs (\"equivalent pairs\"), which were not previously considered because their effect is negligible outside the frozen core. If equivalent pairs represent a measurable source of decoherence, nuclear coherence decays could provide sensitive probes of the symmetries of electronic wave functions. For the phosphorus donor system, we obtain T2n values of order 1 second for both the far-bath and equivalent-pair models, confirming the suitability of proximate nuclei in silicon as very-long-lived spin qubits.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934784131", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"14052026300": {"Name": "Guichard R.", "AuthorID": "14052026300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55369138500": {"Name": "Balian S.J.", "AuthorID": "55369138500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55950044400": {"Name": "Monteiro T.S.", "AuthorID": "55950044400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55522483200": {"Name": "Wolfowicz G.", "AuthorID": "55522483200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "49461639300": {"Name": "Mortemousque P.A.", "AuthorID": "49461639300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
