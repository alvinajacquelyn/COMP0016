Orbital fibroblasts are a key component in GO pathogenesis, which includes inflammation, adipogenesis, hyaluronic acid (HA) secretion, and fibrosis. Macrophages are thought to participate in the immunological stage of GO, but whether they can directly affect the fibroblasts phenotype and modulate disease progression is unknown. We previously showed that GO adipogenic and fibrotic phenotypes could be modelled in a pseudo-physiological 3D environment in vitro. Here, we introduced macrophages in this 3D culture model to investigate role for macrophages in modulating adipogenesis, HA production, and contractility in orbital fibroblasts. Macrophages had a minimal effect on lipid droplet formation in fibroblasts, but significantly increased HA production and cell contractility, suggesting that they may promote the fibrotic phenotype. This effect was found to be mediated at least in part through phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and linked to an increase in actin polymerization and protrusive activity in fibroblasts. Overall our work shows for the first time a direct role for macrophages in modulating the fibroblasts\u2019 phenotype in GO, supporting a role for macrophages in the progression of the fibrotic phenotype through induction of HA production and stimulation of the contractile phenotype in orbital fibroblasts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "Cell Communication", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Susceptibility", "Fibroblasts", "Fibrosis", "Graves Ophthalmopathy", "Humans", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Lipid Metabolism", "Macrophages", "Orbit", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Protein Multimerization", "Signal Transduction", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069269295", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35912547600": {"Name": "Yang I.H.", "AuthorID": "35912547600", "AffiliationID": "60073391, 60031913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine"}, "11439021900": {"Name": "Ezra D.G.", "AuthorID": "11439021900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005694219": {"Name": "Bailly M.", "AuthorID": "7005694219", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55531206700": {"Name": "Rose G.E.", "AuthorID": "55531206700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adnexal Surgery, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
