In 2009, several research studies in the UK were rapidly funded and activated for clinical and public health actions. However, some studies were too late for their results to have an early and substantial effect on clinical care, because of the time required to call for research proposals, assess, fund, and set up the projects. In recognition of these inherent delays, a portfolio of projects was funded by the National Institute for Health Research in 2012. These studies have now been set up (ie, with relevant permissions and arrangements made for data collection) and pilot tested where relevant. All studies are now on standby awaiting activation in the event of a pandemic being declared. In this Personal View, we describe the projects that were set up, the challenges of putting these projects into a maintenance-only state, and ongoing activities to maintain readiness for activation, and discuss how to plan research for a range of major incidents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Diseases, Emerging", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype", "Influenza, Human", "Pandemics", "Population Surveillance", "Public Health", "Research Design", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069732448", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56018813700": {"Name": "Simpson C.R.", "AuthorID": "56018813700", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"}, "56494633800": {"Name": "Beever D.", "AuthorID": "56494633800", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Research Unit, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "55396292700": {"Name": "Goodacre S.", "AuthorID": "55396292700", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Research Unit, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "13612045600": {"Name": "Challen K.", "AuthorID": "13612045600", "AffiliationID": "60022315", "AffiliationName": "Lancashire Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Trust"}, "57198033937": {"Name": "De Angelis D.", "AuthorID": "57198033937", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "57199426537": {"Name": "Fragaszy E.", "AuthorID": "57199426537", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "7201409301": {"Name": "Rubin G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201409301", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Weston Education Centre, King's College London"}, "7202378344": {"Name": "Lim W.S.", "AuthorID": "7202378344", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7006478127": {"Name": "Semple M.G.", "AuthorID": "7006478127", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "16301628100": {"Name": "Knight M.", "AuthorID": "16301628100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
