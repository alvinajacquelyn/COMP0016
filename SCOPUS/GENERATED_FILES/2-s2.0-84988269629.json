Karger AG, Basel.This paper presents an updated and revised summary of the 'core data set' that has been proposed to be recorded and reported in all clinical trials on infant nutrition by the recently formed Consensus Group on Outcome Measures Made in Paediatric Enteral Nutrition Clinical Trials (COMMENT). This core data set was developed based on a previous proposal by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition in 2003. It comprises confidential data to identify subjects and facilitate contact for further follow-up, data to characterize the cohort studied and data on withdrawals from the study, and some additional core data for all nutrition studies on preterm infants. We recommend that all studies on nutrition in infancy should collect and report this core data set to facilitate interpretation and comparison of results from clinical studies, and of systematic data evaluation and meta-analyses. Editors of journals publishing such reports are encouraged to require the reporting of the minimum data set described here either in the main body of the publication or as supplementary online material.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials", "Data reporting", "Human experimentation", "Meta-analysis", "Research subjects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Datasets as Topic", "Enteral Nutrition", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nutritional Status", "Pediatrics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988269629", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"25926500300": {"Name": "Koletzko B.", "AuthorID": "25926500300", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "7402124450": {"Name": "Gibson R.", "AuthorID": "7402124450", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "FOODplus Research Centre, University of Adelaide"}, "7004219656": {"Name": "Van Goudoever J.B.", "AuthorID": "7004219656", "AffiliationID": "60070178, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Emma Children's Hospital, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam"}, "7004403206": {"Name": "Hernell O.", "AuthorID": "7004403206", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Paediatrics, Umea University"}, "7005411699": {"Name": "Shamir R.", "AuthorID": "7005411699", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60015234, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "35494468100": {"Name": "Szajewska H.", "AuthorID": "35494468100", "AffiliationID": "60069009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Warsaw"}}}
