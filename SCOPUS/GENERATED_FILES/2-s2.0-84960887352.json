Using various state-of-the-art analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization techniques - including high resolution TEM imaging, TEM tomography, scanning TEM-high angle annular dark field imaging, and scanning TEM-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping - we gain a comprehensive understanding of the chemical and physical properties of FePt@Fe3O4 NPs. Additional analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry distinguishes the oxide phase and determines the magnetic properties. The geometric phase analysis method is effective in revealing interfacial strain at the core-shell interface. This is of fundamental interest for strain engineering of nanoparticles for desirable applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["core-shell", "geometric phase", "lattice strain", "nanoparticle structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical transmission electron microscopies (TEM)", "Core shell", "Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "Geometric phase", "High-angle annular dark-field imaging", "Lattice strain", "Nanoparticle structures", "Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960887352", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57170318700": {"Name": "Monteforte M.", "AuthorID": "57170318700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics and Nanomaterials Laboratory"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7005152034": {"Name": "Thanh N.T.K.", "AuthorID": "7005152034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "57169240600": {"Name": "Kobayashi S.", "AuthorID": "57169240600", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nano Materials and Technology, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"}, "6505844357": {"Name": "Higashimine K.", "AuthorID": "6505844357", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nano Materials and Technology, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"}, "7102532000": {"Name": "Tung L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102532000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "8256268300": {"Name": "Mott D.M.", "AuthorID": "8256268300", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"}, "6701605610": {"Name": "Maenosono S.", "AuthorID": "6701605610", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"}}}
