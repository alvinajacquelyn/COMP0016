In this paper, we present a method for identifying effective CPS strategies using learner behaviours as the key to data to unpack this complex learning process. In order to distinguish learner behaviour patterns, we deployed an analysis framework for CPS that identifies fine-grained actions in practice-based learning activities. Then, using cumulative time plots we compared expert (those who have more experience in working together) behaviours with novice behaviours. Results show that participants with different levels of expertise in working together, present different behaviour patterns in collaborative problem solving.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analysis frameworks", "Collaborative problem-solving process", "Cumulative time plots", "Practice-based learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis frameworks", "Behaviour patterns", "Collaborative problem solving", "Complex learning", "Cumulative time plots", "Fine grained", "Practice-based learning"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988485485", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56904209900": {"Name": "Cukurova M.", "AuthorID": "56904209900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "35213071000": {"Name": "Avramides K.", "AuthorID": "35213071000", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "35608174500": {"Name": "Luckin R.", "AuthorID": "35608174500", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}}}
