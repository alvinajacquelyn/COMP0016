Whereas blood vessel growth is essential to sustain organ health, chronic hyperpermeability causes damaging tissue edema. By combining in vivo and tissue culture models, we show here that VEGF165-induced vascular leakage requires both VEG FR2 and NRP1, including the VEGF164-binding site of NRP1 and the NRP1 cytoplasmic domain (NCD), but not the known NCD interactor GIPC1. In the VEGF165-bound receptor complex, the NCD promotes ABL kinase activation, which in turn is required to activate VEG FR2-recruited SRC family kinases (SFKs). These results elucidate the receptor complex and signaling hierarchy of downstream kinases that transduce the permeability response to VEGF165. In a mouse model with choroidal neovascularisation akin to age-related macular degeneration, NCD loss attenuated vessel leakage without affecting neovascularisation. These findings raise the possibility that targeting NRP1 or its NCD interactors may be a useful therapeutic strategy in neovascular disease to reduce VEGF165-induced edema without compromising vessel growth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Capillary Permeability", "Enzyme Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neuropilin-1", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl", "Semaphorin-3A", "src-Family Kinases", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022081470", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"23007969000": {"Name": "Fantin A.", "AuthorID": "23007969000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56192095000": {"Name": "Lampropoulou A.", "AuthorID": "56192095000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57189718066": {"Name": "Senatore V.", "AuthorID": "57189718066", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57172002300": {"Name": "Brash J.T.", "AuthorID": "57172002300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "36129560200": {"Name": "Lange C.A.", "AuthorID": "36129560200", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Eye Center, University Hospital Freiburg"}, "14022959200": {"Name": "Liyanage S.E.", "AuthorID": "14022959200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "25926118900": {"Name": "Raimondi C.", "AuthorID": "25926118900", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute Vascular Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "7005169657": {"Name": "Bainbridge J.W.", "AuthorID": "7005169657", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "14019962200": {"Name": "Prahst C.", "AuthorID": "14019962200", "AffiliationID": "60030058", "AffiliationName": "Center for Vascular Biology Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"}, "7006506294": {"Name": "Augustin H.G.", "AuthorID": "7006506294", "AffiliationID": "60001972, 60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Biology and Tumor Angiogenesis (CBTM), Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University"}}}
