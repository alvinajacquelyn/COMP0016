The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..The Chandra archival data is a valuable resource for various studies on different X-ray astronomy topics. In this paper, we utilize this wealth of information and present a uniformly processed data set, which can be used to address a wide range of scientific questions. The data analysis procedures are applied to 10,029 Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer observations, which produces 363,530 source detections belonging to 217,828 distinct X-ray sources. This number is twice the size of the Chandra Source Catalog (Version 1.1). The catalogs in this paper provide abundant estimates of the detected X-ray source properties, including source positions, counts, colors, fluxes, luminosities, variability statistics, etc. Cross-correlation of these objects with galaxies shows that 17,828 sources are located within the D 25 isophotes of 1110 galaxies, and 7504 sources are located between the D 25 and 2D 25 isophotes of 910 galaxies. Contamination analysis with the log N-log S relation indicates that 51.3% of objects within 2D 25 isophotes are truly relevant to galaxies, and the \"net\" source fraction increases to 58.9%, 67.3%, and 69.1% for sources with luminosities above 1037, 1038, and 1039 erg s-1, respectively. Among the possible scientific uses of this catalog, we discuss the possibility of studying intra-observation variability, inter-observation variability, and supersoft sources (SSSs). About 17,092 detected sources above 10 counts are classified as variable in individual observation with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) criterion (P K-S < 0.01). There are 99,647 sources observed more than once and 11,843 sources observed 10 times or more, offering us a wealth of data with which to explore the long-term variability. There are 1638 individual objects (\u223c2350 detections) classified as SSSs. As a quite interesting subclass, detailed studies on X-ray spectra and optical spectroscopic follow-up are needed to categorize these SSSs and pinpoint their properties. In addition, this survey can enable a wide range of statistical studies, such as X-ray activity in different types of stars, X-ray luminosity functions in different types of galaxies, and multi-wavelength identification and classification of different X-ray populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catalogs", "X-rays: general"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977532218", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55801683900": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "55801683900", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7410101094": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "7410101094", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "College of Astronomy and Space Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56789383000": {"Name": "Qiu Y.", "AuthorID": "56789383000", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55943171300": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55943171300", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55361303900": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "55361303900", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56789269100": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56789269100", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, MS-10"}, "57188825493": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57188825493", "AffiliationID": "60007171, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science"}}}
