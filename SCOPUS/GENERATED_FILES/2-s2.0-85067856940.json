Objective: To examine the accuracy of plasma \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau measured using fully automated assays together with other blood-based biomarkers to detect cerebral A\u03b2. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter studies. Study participants were consecutively enrolled between July 6, 2009, and February 11, 2015 (cohort 1), and between January 29, 2000, and October 11, 2006 (cohort 2). Data were analyzed in 2018. The first cohort comprised 842 participants (513 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 265 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 64 with AD dementia) from the Swedish BioFINDER study. The validation cohort comprised 237 participants (34 CU, 109 MCI, and 94 AD dementia) from a German biomarker study. Main Outcome and Measures: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio was used as the reference standard for brain A\u03b2 status. Plasma A\u03b242, A\u03b240 and tau were measured using Elecsys immunoassays (Roche Diagnostics) and examined as predictors of A\u03b2 status in logistic regression models in cohort 1 and replicated in cohort 2. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) and heavy chain (NFH) and APOE genotype were also examined in cohort 1. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 842 participants in cohort 1 was 72 (5.6) years, with a range of 59 to 88 years, and 446 (52.5%) were female. For the 237 in cohort 2, mean (SD) age was 66 (10) years with a range of 23 to 85 years, and 120 (50.6%) were female. In cohort 1, plasma A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 predicted A\u03b2 status with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.83). When adding APOE, the AUC increased significantly to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88). Slight improvements were seen when adding plasma tau (AUC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88) or tau and NFL (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.89) to A\u03b242, A\u03b240 and APOE. The results were similar in CU and cognitively impaired participants, and in younger and older participants. Applying the plasma A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 model from cohort 1 in cohort 2 resulted in slightly higher AUC (0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91), but plasma tau did not contribute. Using plasma A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and APOE in an AD trial screening scenario reduced positron emission tomography costs up to 30% to 50% depending on cutoff. Conclusions and Relevance: Plasma A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 measured using Elecsys immunoassays predict A\u03b2 status in all stages of AD with similar accuracy in a validation cohort. Their accuracy can be further increased by analyzing APOE genotype. Potential future applications of these blood tests include prescreening of A\u03b2 positivity in clinical AD trials to lower the costs and number of positron emission tomography scans or lumbar punctures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067856940", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"25422587800": {"Name": "Palmqvist S.", "AuthorID": "25422587800", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57194936571": {"Name": "Janelidze S.", "AuthorID": "57194936571", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "17343064300": {"Name": "Stomrud E.", "AuthorID": "17343064300", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "9844317000": {"Name": "Karl J.", "AuthorID": "9844317000", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "57201314472": {"Name": "Zink K.", "AuthorID": "57201314472", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "55661859900": {"Name": "Eichenlaub U.", "AuthorID": "55661859900", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "16644532800": {"Name": "Bittner T.", "AuthorID": "16644532800", "AffiliationID": "60026209, 60008201", "AffiliationName": "Genentech, Roche Group"}}}
