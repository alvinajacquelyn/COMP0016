Sound pulses, typically in the megahertz range, are sent into the body and the backscattered echoes are used to create a tomographic image. The contrast of an US image arises from local variations in the physical properties of the tissues, primarily density and elasticity, revealing tissue structures at depth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Backscattered echoes", "Imaging modality", "Local variations", "Medical ultrasound", "Real time images", "Tissue structure", "Tomographic images", "Ultrasound imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032751705", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56904066600": {"Name": "Stanziola A.", "AuthorID": "56904066600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasound Laboratory for Imaging and Sensing Group, Imperial College London"}, "55827074500": {"Name": "Toulemonde M.", "AuthorID": "55827074500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasound Laboratory for Imaging and Sensing Group, Imperial College London"}, "57207566045": {"Name": "Yildiz Y.", "AuthorID": "57207566045", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasound Laboratory for Imaging and Sensing Group, Imperial College London"}, "7003271043": {"Name": "Eckersley R.", "AuthorID": "7003271043", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "35346143000": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "35346143000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasound Laboratory for Imaging and Sensing group, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}}}
