Published by Oxford University Press.Mutations in the RP2 gene lead to a severe form of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. RP2 patients frequently present with nonsense mutations and no treatments are currently available to restore RP2 function. In this study, we reprogrammed fibroblasts from an RP2 patient carrying the nonsense mutation c.519C>T (p.R120X) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and differentiated these cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) to study the mechanisms of disease and test potential therapies. RP2 protein was undetectable in the RP2 R120X patient cells, suggesting a disease mechanism caused by complete lack of RP2 protein. The RP2 patient fibroblasts and iPSC-derived RPE cells showed phenotypic defects in IFT20 localization, Golgi cohesion and G\u03b21 trafficking. These phenotypes were corrected by over-expressing GFP-tagged RP2. Using the translational read-through inducing drugs (TRIDs) G418 and PTC124 (Ataluren), we were able to restore up to 20% of endogenous, full-length RP2 protein in R120X cells. This level of restored RP2 was sufficient to reverse the cellular phenotypic defects observed in both the R120X patient fibroblasts and iPSC-RPE cells. This is the first proof-of-concept study to demonstrate successful read-through and restoration of RP2 function for the R120X nonsense mutation. The ability of the restored RP2 protein level to reverse the observed cellular phenotypes in cells lacking RP2 indicates that translational read-through could be clinically beneficial for patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Differentiation", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Cilia", "Epithelial Cells", "Eye Proteins", "Fibroblasts", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation", "Oxadiazoles", "Phenotype", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Protein Transport", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922471648", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"14319183000": {"Name": "Schwarz N.", "AuthorID": "14319183000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7402236681": {"Name": "Carr A.J.", "AuthorID": "7402236681", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56398991700": {"Name": "Lane A.", "AuthorID": "56398991700", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57206672030": {"Name": "Chen L.L.", "AuthorID": "57206672030", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "26031889400": {"Name": "Aguil\u00e0 M.", "AuthorID": "26031889400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56444492500": {"Name": "Nommiste B.", "AuthorID": "56444492500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "23474343200": {"Name": "Muthiah M.N.", "AuthorID": "23474343200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6603470203": {"Name": "Kanuga N.", "AuthorID": "6603470203", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701376895": {"Name": "Da cruz L.", "AuthorID": "6701376895", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005568195": {"Name": "Coffey P.J.", "AuthorID": "7005568195", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57204676942": {"Name": "Cheetham M.E.", "AuthorID": "57204676942", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56509175700": {"Name": "Moeller F.", "AuthorID": "56509175700", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Johannes Gutenberg-University"}, "7004497667": {"Name": "Wolfrum U.", "AuthorID": "7004497667", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Johannes Gutenberg-University"}, "6506313808": {"Name": "Nagel-wolfrum K.", "AuthorID": "6506313808", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Johannes Gutenberg-University"}}}
