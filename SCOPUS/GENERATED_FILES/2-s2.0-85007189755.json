This focus should be on maximising the growth effects of their interaction, with an emphasis on the importance of deep integration. The note provides three examples that show how deep integration has contributed to stop the relative economic decline in the UK vis-\u00e0-vis the EU founding members; how deep integration increased productivity in Sweden, Austria, and Finland compared to that in Norway; and how a key mechanism to advancements in the new EU member states has been the capacity of deep integration to generate institutional change.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007189755", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)", "BUSI", "1401"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"]], "AuthorData": {"7006704860": {"Name": "Campos N.", "AuthorID": "7006704860", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Finance, Brunel University"}}}
