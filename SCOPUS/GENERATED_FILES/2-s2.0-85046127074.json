Based on welding technology, the process is highly affordable, has a very high deposition rate and is not limited by chamber size. Ti-6Al-4V is a promising candidate material for this technology given that it is extensively used in aerospace applications and some large, high buy-fly ratio components can be more efficiently produced by WAAM than via the conventional machining from billet approach. There is currently limited knowledge about whether additional post processes including heat treatments and hot isostatic pressing are necessary to unlock the optimal mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V components produced by WAAM. This work explores a range of different post process treatments and the effects on the microstructure and tensile properties of Ti-6Al-4V components produced by WAAM. The relatively slow cooling rate (10-20Ks\u22121) during the \u03b2-\u03b1 transformation produced Widmanst\u00e4tten-\u03b1 and offered an optimal balance between strength and ductility. Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPing) removed gas porosity but was not effective in improving strength or ductility. Residual tensile stresses in as-built components severely impair ductility and should be removed through stress relief treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Liquid-solid reactions", "Mechanical properties", "Metals and alloys", "Microstructure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerospace components", "Conventional machining", "High deposition rates", "Liquid-solid reaction", "Manufacturing process", "Metals and alloys", "Residual tensile stress", "Strength and ductilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046127074", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"23479496300": {"Name": "Bermingham M.J.", "AuthorID": "23479496300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing, School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "57201799628": {"Name": "Nicastro L.", "AuthorID": "57201799628", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing, School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "6507125193": {"Name": "Dargusch M.S.", "AuthorID": "6507125193", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing, School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "8557476400": {"Name": "Kent D.", "AuthorID": "8557476400", "AffiliationID": "60032607", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast"}, "55482183800": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "55482183800", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
