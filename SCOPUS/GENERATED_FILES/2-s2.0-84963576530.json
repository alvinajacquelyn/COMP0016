The FEBS Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.Neuropilin-2 is a transmembrane receptor involved in lymphangiogenesis and neuronal development. In adults, neuropilin-2 and its homologous protein neuropilin-1 have been implicated in cancers and infection. Molecular determinants of the ligand selectivity of neuropilins are poorly understood. We have identified and structurally characterized a zinc ion binding site on human neuropilin-2. The neuropilin-2-specific zinc ion binding site is located near the interface between domains b1 and b2 in the ectopic region of the protein, remote from the neuropilin binding site for its physiological ligand, i.e. vascular endothelial growth factor. We also present an X-ray crystal structure of the neuropilin-2 b1 domain in a complex with the C-terminal sub-domain of VEGF-A. Zn2+ binding to neuropilin-2 destabilizes the protein structure but this effect was counteracted by heparin, suggesting that modifications by glycans and zinc in the extracellular matrix may affect functional neuropilin-2 ligand binding and signalling activity. Structure of NRP2 b1 domain (yellow) in a complex with the VEGF-A-derived peptide (atom coloured) reveals that VEGF-A binds to the canonical ligand binding groove on the b1 domain. In addition, structural investigations and mutagenesis studies identified NRP2-specific zinc ion-binding site (structure shown in green) near the putative heparin-binding surface. Zinc binding destabilises NRP2 b1 while heparin interaction with NRP2 increases protein stability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["neuropilins", "signalling", "vascular endothelial growth factor", "X-ray crystallography", "zinc"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Humans", "Neuropilin-2", "Protein Conformation", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963576530", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57188818732": {"Name": "Tsai Y.C.I.", "AuthorID": "57188818732", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory"}, "56677866700": {"Name": "Yelland T.", "AuthorID": "56677866700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, Darwin Building"}, "7006536499": {"Name": "Djordjevic S.", "AuthorID": "7006536499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, Darwin Building"}, "6508373661": {"Name": "Fotinou C.", "AuthorID": "6508373661", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Magnus Life Science, University College London"}, "57188806811": {"Name": "Rana R.", "AuthorID": "57188806811", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Magnus Life Science, University College London"}, "57217377365": {"Name": "Frankel P.", "AuthorID": "57217377365", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, BHF Laboratories at University College London"}, "7006463251": {"Name": "Zachary I.", "AuthorID": "7006463251", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, BHF Laboratories at University College London"}}}
