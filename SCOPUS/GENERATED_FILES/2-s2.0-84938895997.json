There is no one model that guarantees success. We describe here a drug discovery story where chance, the ability to capitalise on chance, and the assembling of a range of expertise, have all played important roles in the discovery and subsequent development of an antibiotic chemotype based on the bis-benzimidazole scaffold, with potency against a number of current therapeutically challenging diseases. One compound in this class, SMT19969, has recently entered Phase 2 human clinical trials for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938895997", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"23067508300": {"Name": "Mann J.", "AuthorID": "23067508300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7404775765": {"Name": "Taylor P.W.", "AuthorID": "7404775765", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55320506300": {"Name": "Dale A.G.", "AuthorID": "55320506300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "38761289800": {"Name": "Dorgan C.R.", "AuthorID": "38761289800", "AffiliationID": "60109146", "AffiliationName": "Summit Therapeutics"}, "57220882032": {"Name": "Johnson P.D.", "AuthorID": "57220882032", "AffiliationID": "60109146", "AffiliationName": "Summit Therapeutics"}, "7202849332": {"Name": "Wilson F.X.", "AuthorID": "7202849332", "AffiliationID": "60109146", "AffiliationName": "Summit Therapeutics"}, "56365982700": {"Name": "Vickers R.", "AuthorID": "56365982700", "AffiliationID": "60109146", "AffiliationName": "Summit Therapeutics"}}}
