These perturbations represent the small fluctuations that must exist in a quantum treatment of the problem. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that at the linear level a subset of these fluctuations experience parametric amplification as a result of their coupling to the planar symmetric background. Here we study the full three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics using lattice simulations, including both the early time regime when the fluctuations are well described by linear perturbation theory as well as the subsequent stage of fully nonlinear evolution. We find that the nonplanar fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the overall evolution of the system. Specifically, once these fluctuations begin to interact nonlinearly the split into a planar symmetric part of the field and the nonplanar fluctuations loses its utility. At this point the colliding domain walls dissolve, with the endpoint of this being the creation of a population of oscillons in the collision region. The original (nearly) planar symmetry has been completely destroyed at this point and an accurate study of the system requires the full three-dimensional simulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmic strings", "cosmological applications of theories with extra dimensions", "cosmological phase transitions", "cosmology with extra dimensions", "domain walls", "monopoles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940829123", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"7005001248": {"Name": "Braden J.", "AuthorID": "7005001248", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55662855000": {"Name": "Bond J.R.", "AuthorID": "55662855000", "AffiliationID": "60017159, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "CITA, University of Toronto"}, "6603197672": {"Name": "Mersini-Houghton L.", "AuthorID": "6603197672", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, 1 Phillips Hall"}}}
