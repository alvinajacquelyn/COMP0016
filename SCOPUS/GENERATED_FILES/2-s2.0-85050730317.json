The 13.3 MHz fundamental operating frequency of the surface acoustic wave microfluidic device allows the manipulation of particles on the micrometer scale. Experiments, validated by computational fluid dynamics, were carried out to demonstrate size-based sorting of 5-14.5 \u03bcm diameter polystyrene (PS) particles and density/compressibility-based sorting of 10 \u03bcm PS, iron-oxide, and poly(methyl methacrylate) particles, with densities ranging from 1.05 to 1.5 g/cm3. The method shows a sorting efficiency of >90% and a purity of >80% for particle separation of 10 \u03bcm and 14.5 \u03bcm, demonstrating better performance than similar sorting methods recently published (72%-83% efficiency). The sorting technique demonstrates high selectivity separation of particles, with the smallest particle ratio being 1.33, compared to 2.5 in previous work. Density/compressibility-based sorting of polystyrene and iron-oxide particles showed an efficiency of 97 \u00b1 4% and a purity of 91 \u00b1 5%. By varying the sign of the acoustic excitation signal, continuous batch acoustic sorting of target particles to a desired outlet was demonstrated with good sorting stability against variations of the inflow rates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic excitation", "Frequency differences", "Iron oxide particles", "Micro-fluidic devices", "Operating frequency", "Particle separation", "Sorting techniques", "Surface acoustic waves"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050730317", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57192068624": {"Name": "Simon G.", "AuthorID": "57192068624", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "24481885000": {"Name": "Marques-Hueso J.", "AuthorID": "24481885000", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "35550207300": {"Name": "Desmulliez M.P.Y.", "AuthorID": "35550207300", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "24479413400": {"Name": "Bernassau A.L.", "AuthorID": "24479413400", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56382396000": {"Name": "Pailhas Y.", "AuthorID": "56382396000", "AffiliationID": "113428121", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation"}, "34978280600": {"Name": "Andrade M.A.B.", "AuthorID": "34978280600", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7004500625": {"Name": "Riehle M.O.", "AuthorID": "7004500625", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology, Centre for Cell Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
