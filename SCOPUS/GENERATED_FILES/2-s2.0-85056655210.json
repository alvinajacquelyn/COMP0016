As we grow older we increasingly rely on our other senses to explore our surroundings and objects in the world. When interacting with technology, we mainly rely on our senses of vision, touch, and hearing, and the sense of taste becomes reduced to the context of eating and food experiences. In this paper, we build on initial efforts to enhance gaming experiences through gustatory stimuli. We introduce TasteBud, a gustatory gaming interface that we integrated with the classic Minesweeper game. We first describe the details on the hardware and software design for the taste stimulation and then present initial findings from a user study. We discuss how taste has the potential to transform gaming experiences through systematically exploiting the experiences individual gustatory stimuli (e.g., sweet, bitter, sour) can elicit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gaming experience", "Gustatory interface", "Interaction modality", "Multisensory design", "Taste", "Taste-based technology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gaming experiences", "Hardware and software designs", "Interaction modality", "Multisensory", "Taste", "User study"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056655210", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"55247108300": {"Name": "Vi C.", "AuthorID": "55247108300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, University of Sussex"}, "57200406184": {"Name": "Arthur D.", "AuthorID": "57200406184", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, University of Sussex"}, "22835490000": {"Name": "Obrist M.", "AuthorID": "22835490000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, University of Sussex"}}}
