A significant obstacle to development in this discipline is the absence of a common understanding of what constitutes a cognitive radar. The proposition in this study is that radar systems should not be classed as cognitive, or not cognitive, but should be graded by the degree of cognition exhibited. The authors introduce a new taxonomy framework for cognitive radar against which research, experimental and production systems can be benchmarked, enabling clear communication regarding the level of cognition being discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive radars", "Production system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058171190", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57197653103": {"Name": "Horne C.", "AuthorID": "57197653103", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
