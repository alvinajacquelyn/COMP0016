Despite their importance as deep-water habitats, the underlying genetic structure and gene-flow patterns of most deep-water populations remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated genetic connectivity of the primnoid octocoral Narella versluysi across the continental shelf of Bay of Biscay, spanning 360 km (95 samples from submarine canyons, ranging from 709\u20131247 m depths). We report 12 novel microsatellite markers which were used to genotype 83 samples from 6 populations. Sixteen samples were sequenced for three mitochondrial DNA regions (Folmer region of COI with an adjacent intergenic region igr1, MT-ND2 gene, and mtMutS homolog 1 region). All sequence haplotypes and genetic clusters were found in multiple sites spanning more than 200 km. Overall, our analyses suggest that there is high gene flow between colonies of N. versluysi among all study sites. There is no significant geographic structure and no pattern of isolation by distance or depth. Connectivity is facilitated by the prevailing current which runs along the shelf break, and could be a mechanism to connect all of the sampled locations. The high connectivity over large geographic distance is a positive sign for a potentially vulnerable organism and may provide some resilience to disturbance. This information is crucial for a better understanding of how this fragile benthic fauna may respond to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances, which is a cornerstone for effective habitat management.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051111125", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"8853289200": {"Name": "Yesson C.", "AuthorID": "8853289200", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "56262365200": {"Name": "Wright E.", "AuthorID": "56262365200", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "36994491400": {"Name": "Braga-Henriques A.", "AuthorID": "36994491400", "AffiliationID": "121067440", "AffiliationName": "ARDITI-Regional Agency for the Development of Research, Technology and Innovation, Oceanic Observatory of Madeira (OOM)"}}}
