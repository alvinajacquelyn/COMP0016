While promising, ACT treatment process research in the context of chronic pain so far has only focused on a few of the processes of psychological flexibility. Therefore, this study aimed to more comprehensively examine changes in processes of psychological flexibility following an ACT-based treatment for chronic pain, and to examine change in these processes in relation to improvements in patient functioning. Individuals with chronic pain attending an interdisciplinary ACT-based rehabilitation program completed measures of pain, functioning, depression, pain acceptance, cognitive fusion, decentering, and committed action at pre- and post-treatment and during a nine-month follow-up. Significant improvements were observed from pre- to post-treatment and pre-treatment to follow-up on each of the treatment outcome and process variables. Regression analyses indicated that change in psychological flexibility processes cumulatively explained 6\u201327 % of the variance in changes in functioning and depression over both assessment periods, even after controlling for changes in pain intensity. Further research is needed to maximize the effectiveness of ACT for chronic pain, and to determine whether larger improvements in the processes of psychological flexibility under study will produce better patient outcomes, as predicted by the psychological flexibility model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceptance and commitment therapy", "Chronic pain", "Psychological flexibility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959531104", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56409298400": {"Name": "Scott W.", "AuthorID": "56409298400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology Section, Psychology Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57220605550": {"Name": "Hann K.E.J.", "AuthorID": "57220605550", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology Section, Psychology Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7006807866": {"Name": "McCracken L.M.", "AuthorID": "7006807866", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "INPUT Pain Management, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
