Published by Taylor & Francis.The paper assesses how housing commodification in China has been used to cope with the impact of financial crises and open up new opportunities to boost economic growth. In particular, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the injection of capital has led to a new housing market cycle. We explain the major housing market cycles after 1978 and suggest an underlying linkage with macroeconomic measures aimed at making housing a more \u2018liquid\u2019 asset and richer households increasingly using second homes as an investment strategy. Further, the Chinese form of development regime is examined, revealing the role of local government in promoting housing markets, on the one hand, and the concern of central government with property bubbles and financial risks \u2013 leading to the adaptation of a more regulated approach to restrict housing sales \u2013 on the other. We argue that housing market cycles should be understood by seeing how property development is at the centre of urban development in China.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "global economic crisis", "house price", "housing boom", "the state"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922388339", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7403463877": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "7403463877", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
