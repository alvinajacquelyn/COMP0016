In the medical literature, practice surveys are increasingly used in specialties, such as pediatric surgery, characterized by the lack of sufficient evidence-based literature due to the rarity of the conditions treated. To maintain a level that yields to a meaningful scientific contribution the design, data collection and analysis of the survey have to be rigorous. Herein, we describe the general principles of survey methodology, we report the benefits and limitations of this statistical method, and we discuss the value of surveys in pediatric surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["evidence based", "methodology", "questionnaire", "survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Pediatrics", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Specialties, Surgical", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952975705", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"7003624486": {"Name": "Zani A.", "AuthorID": "7003624486", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Surgery Unit, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "30567619200": {"Name": "Zani-Ruttenstock E.", "AuthorID": "30567619200", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}}}
