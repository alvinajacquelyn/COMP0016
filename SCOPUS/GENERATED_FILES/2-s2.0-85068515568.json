Using publicly available documents and data collected with youth at two community-based youth centers, we ask, what is the \u201cgood\u201d\u2019 they do for young people, and how do young people negotiate these discourses? We argue that youth centers operate in a discursive tension, constructed as a place to change by the (organizational) bodies that establish them, and a place to chill by the (youth) bodies that use them. We trace how these discourses entered into the everyday lived contexts of youth centers, including their program logics, measures of success, and constructions of youthful subjectivities.
