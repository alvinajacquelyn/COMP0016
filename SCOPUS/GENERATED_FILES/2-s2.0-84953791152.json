Endovascular technology, in particular the evolution of fenestrated and branched (F/B) endografts used in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has provided a less invasive method of treating these complex aneurysms. This study evaluated the technical and clinical outcomes of F/B-EVAR for extensive type II and III TAAA. Methods Data from 354 high-risk patients enrolled in a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption trial (2004-2013) undergoing F/B-EVAR for type II and III TAAA were evaluated. Technical success, perioperative clinical outcomes, and midterm outcomes (36 months) for branch patency, reintervention, aneurysm-related death, and all-cause mortality were analyzed. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and were assessed using Kaplan-Meier, univariate, and multivariate analysis. Results F/B-EVARs incorporating 1305 fenestration/branches were implanted with 96% of target vessels successfully stented. Completion aortography showed 2.8% patients had a type I or III endoleak. Procedure duration (6.0 \u00b1 1.7 vs 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 hours; P <.01) and hospital stay (13.1 \u00b1 10.1 vs 10.2 \u00b1 7.4 days; P <.01) were longer for type II TAAA. Perioperative mortality was greater in type II repairs (7.0% vs 3.5%; P <.001). Permanent spinal cord ischemia occurred in 4% and renal failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 2.8% of patients. Twenty-seven branches (7.6%) required reintervention for stenosis or occlusion; and celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and renal artery secondary patency at 36 months was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.99), 98% (95% CI, 0.97-1.0), and 98% (95% CI, 0.96-1.0), respectively. Eighty endoleak repairs were performed in 67 patients, including 55 branch-related endoleaks, 4 type Ia, 5 type Ib, and 15 type II endoleaks. At 36 months, freedom from aneurysm-related death was 91% (95% CI, 0.88-0.95), and freedom from all-cause mortality was 57% (95% CI, 0.50-0.63). The treatment of type II TAAA (P <.01), age (P <.01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P <.05) negatively affected survival. Conclusions F/B-EVAR is a robust treatment option for patients at increased risk for conventional repair of extensive TAAAs. Technical success and branch patency are excellent, but some patients will require reintervention for branch-related endoleak. Aneurysm extent portends a higher risk of perioperative and long-term morbidity and mortality. Additional efforts are needed to improve outcomes and understand the utility of this treatment option in the general TAAA population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic", "Aortography", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Endovascular Procedures", "Female", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Ohio", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Prosthesis Design", "Retreatment", "Risk Factors", "Stents", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Vascular Patency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953791152", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7004221232": {"Name": "Eagleton M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004221232", "AffiliationID": "60080345, 60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, H32, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine-CWRU"}, "57044622000": {"Name": "Follansbee M.", "AuthorID": "57044622000", "AffiliationID": "60080345, 60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, H32, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine-CWRU"}, "7003903202": {"Name": "Wolski K.", "AuthorID": "7003903202", "AffiliationID": "60080345, 60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, H32, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine-CWRU"}, "8524404100": {"Name": "Mastracci T.", "AuthorID": "8524404100", "AffiliationID": "60080345, 60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, H32, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine-CWRU"}, "56231211000": {"Name": "Kuramochi Y.", "AuthorID": "56231211000", "AffiliationID": "60080345, 60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, H32, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine-CWRU"}}}
