Nigeria, whose last confirmed case of monkeypox was in 1978, is currently experiencing an unusually large and outbreak of human monkeypox cases, a \u2018One Human-Environmental-Animal Health\u2019 approach is being effectively used to define and tackle the outbreak. As of 13th October 2018, there have been one hundred and sixteen confirmed cases the majority of whom are under 40 years. Over the past 20 years ten Central and West African countries have reported monkeypox cases which have risen exponentially. We review the history and evolution of monkeypox outbreaks in Africa and USA, the changing clinical presentations, and discuss possible factors underlying the increasing numbers being detected including the cessation of smallpox vaccination programs. Major knowledge gaps remain on the epidemiology, host reservoir, and emergence, transmission, pathogenesis and prevention of monkeypoz.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Outbreaks", "Disease Reservoirs", "Epidemics", "Humans", "Monkeypox", "Public Health", "Smallpox", "Vaccination", "Zoonoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056979811", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7202854790": {"Name": "Petersen E.", "AuthorID": "7202854790", "AffiliationID": "121668649", "AffiliationName": "ESCMID Emerging Infections Task Force"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35798684000": {"Name": "Lule S.A.", "AuthorID": "35798684000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "8523824200": {"Name": "Ihekweazu C.", "AuthorID": "8523824200", "AffiliationID": "60138721", "AffiliationName": "Nigeria Centre for Disease Control"}, "7103238630": {"Name": "Heymann D.", "AuthorID": "7103238630", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004125689": {"Name": "Ntoumi F.", "AuthorID": "7004125689", "AffiliationID": "60072530", "AffiliationName": "University Marien NGouabi and Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (FCRM)"}, "21033243100": {"Name": "Blumberg L.", "AuthorID": "21033243100", "AffiliationID": "60031471", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases"}, "8927884000": {"Name": "Asogun D.", "AuthorID": "8927884000", "AffiliationID": "60017037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, Ambrose Alli University"}, "23992739000": {"Name": "Mukonka V.", "AuthorID": "23992739000", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Zambia National Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health"}, "20336943700": {"Name": "Bates M.", "AuthorID": "20336943700", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln"}, "8863880200": {"Name": "Honeyborne I.", "AuthorID": "8863880200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Center for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Center for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "6603198848": {"Name": "Mfinanga S.", "AuthorID": "6603198848", "AffiliationID": "112949974", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Medical Research Muhimbili"}, "56744548100": {"Name": "Mwaba P.", "AuthorID": "56744548100", "AffiliationID": "60072796", "AffiliationName": "UNZA-UCLMS Project, Lusaka Apex University Medical School"}, "32867537600": {"Name": "Dar O.", "AuthorID": "32867537600", "AffiliationID": "60020875", "AffiliationName": "Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security"}, "36846052400": {"Name": "Vairo F.", "AuthorID": "36846052400", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS"}, "7102706668": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "7102706668", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS"}, "57200147150": {"Name": "Mukhtar M.", "AuthorID": "57200147150", "AffiliationID": "60071726, 60071723", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum"}, "7006702581": {"Name": "Kock R.", "AuthorID": "7006702581", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at UCL Hospitals"}}}
