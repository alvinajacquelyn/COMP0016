The basis for this very unusual behavior has been investigated by density functional theory calculations using a hybrid Hamiltonian, mobility modeling, X-ray photoemission, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. In contrast to previous claims that Mo acts as a three-electron donor, it is shown that substitutional Mo traps two electrons in localized states falling within the bulk bandgap and thus Mo is a simple one-electron donor. At the same time, there is very little hybridization of Mo 4d states with In 5s states at the bottom of the conduction band. This results in conduction that is spatially separated to some degree from the donors, giving rise to significantly reduced ionized impurity scattering, enhancing the carrier mobility. This is in contrast to Sn-doped In<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> where the conduction band minimum has significant Sn 5s character, resulting in regular ionized impurity scattering.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol assisted chemical vapor depositions (AACVD)", "Conduction-band minimum", "Electron donors", "Ionized impurity scattering", "Localized state", "One electron donors", "Unusual behaviors", "X-ray photoemissions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928679330", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"53163106200": {"Name": "Bhachu D.S.", "AuthorID": "53163106200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.E.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Diamond House"}, "6603438328": {"Name": "Cibin G.", "AuthorID": "6603438328", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Diamond House"}, "7006346007": {"Name": "Dent A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006346007", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Diamond House"}, "6603739582": {"Name": "Veal T.D.", "AuthorID": "6603739582", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Physical Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "7005782109": {"Name": "Egdell R.G.", "AuthorID": "7005782109", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory"}}}
