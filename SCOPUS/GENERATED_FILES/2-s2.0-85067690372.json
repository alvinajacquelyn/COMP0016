Many pathogenic aspects of this disease remain largely unclear. Here, we report novel pathological defects in skeletal muscle fibres of mouse models and patients with NM: irregular spacing and morphology of nuclei; disrupted nuclear envelope; altered chromatin arrangement; and disorganisation of the cortical cytoskeleton. Impairments in contractility are the primary cause of these nuclear defects. We also establish the role of microtubule organisation in determining nuclear morphology, a phenomenon which is likely to contribute to nuclear alterations in this disease. Our results overlap with findings in diseases caused directly by mutations in nuclear envelope or cytoskeletal proteins. Given the important role of nuclear shape and envelope in regulating gene expression, and the cytoskeleton in maintaining muscle fibre integrity, our findings are likely to explain some of the hallmarks of NM, including contractile filament disarray, altered mechanical properties and broad transcriptional alterations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin", "Lamin", "Microtubules", "Nemaline myopathy", "Nuclear envelope", "Skeletal muscle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Cell Nucleus", "Cytoskeleton", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Myopathies, Nemaline", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067690372", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57192690938": {"Name": "Ross J.A.", "AuthorID": "57192690938", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Human and Applied Physiological Sciences, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London"}, "57188588463": {"Name": "Levy Y.", "AuthorID": "57188588463", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Human and Applied Physiological Sciences, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London"}, "6507058079": {"Name": "Ochala J.", "AuthorID": "6507058079", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London"}, "22953942100": {"Name": "Ripolone M.", "AuthorID": "22953942100", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular and Rare Diseases Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "7007005652": {"Name": "Moggio M.", "AuthorID": "7007005652", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular and Rare Diseases Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "56814424400": {"Name": "Kolb J.S.", "AuthorID": "56814424400", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona"}, "54996311800": {"Name": "Lindqvist J.", "AuthorID": "54996311800", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona"}, "7004852034": {"Name": "Granzier H.", "AuthorID": "7004852034", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona"}, "6701556011": {"Name": "Turmaine M.", "AuthorID": "6701556011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7103186722": {"Name": "Holt M.", "AuthorID": "7103186722", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London"}, "23091067900": {"Name": "Figeac N.", "AuthorID": "23091067900", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London"}, "6603883688": {"Name": "Zammit P.S.", "AuthorID": "6603883688", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London"}, "7006738404": {"Name": "Jungbluth H.", "AuthorID": "7006738404", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College"}, "6602174457": {"Name": "Claeys K.G.", "AuthorID": "6602174457", "AffiliationID": "60121246, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Muscle Diseases and Neuropathies, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven"}, "7202856417": {"Name": "Weis J.", "AuthorID": "7202856417", "AffiliationID": "60001097", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, RWTH Aachen University Hospital"}, "36056639400": {"Name": "Monforte M.", "AuthorID": "36056639400", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e0 Operativa Complessa di Neurologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.
