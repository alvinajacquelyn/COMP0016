The films were annealed at 600 \u00b0C and analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV/vis/near-IR spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. All the films were crystalline, and the silver was present in its elemental form and of nanometer dimension. The antibacterial activity of these samples was tested against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in the dark and under UV light (365 nm). All Ag-deposited films reduced the numbers of E. coli by 99.9% within 6 h and the numbers of S. aureus by 99.9% within only 2 h. FTO/Ag reduced bacterial numbers of E. coli to below the detection limit after 60 min and caused a 99.9% reduction of S. aureus within only 15 min of UV irradiation. Activ/Ag reduced the numbers of S. aureus by 66.6% after 60 min and TiO2/Ag killed 99.9% of S. aureus within 60 min of UV exposure. More remarkably, we observed a 99.9% reduction in the numbers of E. coli within 6 h and the numbers of S. aureus within 4 h in the dark using our novel TiO2/Ag system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ag", "antimicrobial", "CVD", "Escherichia coli", "FTO", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapor depositions", "Anti-bacterial activity", "antimicrobial", "Bactericidal activity", "Fluorine doped tin oxide", "FTO", "Nanometer dimensions", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Aerosols", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Escherichia coli", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Silver", "Staphylococcus aureus", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952908296", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55681972200": {"Name": "Ponja S.D.", "AuthorID": "55681972200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56450900200": {"Name": "Sehmi S.K.", "AuthorID": "56450900200", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Disease, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "Macrobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Disease, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
