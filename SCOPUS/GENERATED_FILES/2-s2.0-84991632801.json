Results show that under similar settings, these two simulation models produce similar results in a single user scenario but perform differently in a multi-UE scenario. Moreover, the proportional fair scheduling is shown to be the fairest one using both simulation models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cross-layer simulation", "LTE", "MAC scheduler"], "IndexKeywords": ["Based modelling", "Cross layer", "Discrete-event simulation model", "Discrete-time simulation", "MAC scheduler", "PHY-MAC cross-layer", "Proportional fair scheduling", "QoS optimization"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991632801", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57191581484": {"Name": "Soekartono A.", "AuthorID": "57191581484", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "9734845000": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "9734845000", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "Wireless Technology Innovation (WTI) Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, BUPT"}}}
