We investigated the relationship of poor vision and incident prefrailty and frailty. Methods Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses with 4-year follow-up of 2836 English communitydwellers aged \u226560 years. Vision impairment was defined as poor self-reported vision. A score of 0 out of the 5 Fried phenotype components was defined as non-frail, 1-2 prefrail and \u22653 as frail. Participants non-frail at baseline were followed-up for incident prefrailty and frailty. Participants prefrail at baseline were followed-up for incident frailty. Results 49% of participants (n=1396) were non-frail, 42% (n=1178) prefrail and 9% (n=262) frail. At followup, there were 367 new cases of prefrailty and frailty among those non-frail at baseline, and 133 new cases of frailty among those prefrail at baseline. In crosssectional analysis, vision impairment was associated with frailty (age-adjustedandsex-adjusted OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.30). The association remained after further adjustment for wealth, education, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, falls, cognition and depression. In longitudinal analysis, compared with non-frail participants with no vision impairment, non-frail participants with vision impairment had twofold increased risks of prefrailty or frailty at follow-up (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.24). The association remained after further adjustment. Prefrail participants with vision impairment did not have greater risks of becoming frail at follow-up. Conclusion Non-frail older adults who experience poor vision have increased risks of becoming prefrail and frail over 4 years. This is of public health importance as both vision impairment and frailty affect a large number of older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Frail Elderly", "Frailty", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Self Report", "United Kingdom", "Vision Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031726872", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57132532900": {"Name": "Liljas A.E.M.", "AuthorID": "57132532900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "53865343000": {"Name": "Papachristou E.", "AuthorID": "53865343000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.R.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "55440517500": {"Name": "Carvalho L.A.", "AuthorID": "55440517500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "De Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9743612700": {"Name": "Ramsay S.E.", "AuthorID": "9743612700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}}}
