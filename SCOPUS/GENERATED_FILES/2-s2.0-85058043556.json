We achieve this by halogenating the organic linkers of IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-7 to create permanent dipole moments on the linkers, hence making them responsive to changes in the strength and direction of an electric field. More importantly we show that by varying the ligand size and the halogen type, number and substitution positions, the strength of the electric field required to control the rotation of linkers can be reduced significantly. Cl substitution is most effective in making the organic linkers electric field responsive since a greater dipole moment is created compared to those obtained by F or Br substitution. Cl substitution of a larger organic linker, i.e. 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate (IRMOF-7) rather than 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (IRMOF-1), results in a greater dipole moment and reduces the electric field strength required for the rotation of the ligand. Furthermore, double Cl substitution and the optimization of the Cl substitution positions enable controlled rotation of the IRMOF-7 linkers with an electric field strength as low as 0.5 V nm\u22121. Finally, using the electric field induced rotation of organic linkers we show that it is possible to enhance the diffusion of methane molecules in a chosen direction while limiting their mobility in other directions. Our study hints at the potential of using MOFs for flow control in nanofluidic systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational studies", "Electric field induced", "Electric field strength", "External electric field", "Isoreticular metal-organic frameworks", "Methane molecules", "Nanofluidic systems", "Permanent dipoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058043556", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56394620800": {"Name": "Namsani S.", "AuthorID": "56394620800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "14061497000": {"Name": "Yazaydin A.", "AuthorID": "14061497000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
