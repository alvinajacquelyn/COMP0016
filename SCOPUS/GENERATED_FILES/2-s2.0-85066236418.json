In recent years, reports indicate that alterations in nucleocytoplasmic transport may be a hallmark of both healthy and pathological aging. In this review, I summarize recent evidence supporting this information, specifically focusing on the association between the nucleocytoplasmic transport and aging of the brain, indicating both common and case-specific mechanisms and their interplay, and pointing out alterations of these mechanisms as regulatory \u201cswitches\u201d for the fate of the aging brain. Importantly, some of these alterations are intervenable druggable targets, paving the way to a future pharmacotherapeutic intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "Alzheimer's disease", "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "frontotemporal dementia", "Huntington disease", "neurodegeneration", "neurodegenerative diseases", "prion diseases", "tauopathies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066236418", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"26967494900": {"Name": "Benvegn\u00f9 S.", "AuthorID": "26967494900", "AffiliationID": "60018505, 60073905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuropathology, Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular \u201cSevero Ochoa\u201d, CSIC-UAM"}}}
