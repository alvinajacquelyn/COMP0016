Karger AG, Basel.Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg (DEX) as adjunctive therapy to ranibizumab in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD). Procedures: This was a 6-month, single-masked, multicenter study. Patients were randomized to DEX implant (n = 123) or sham procedure (n = 120) and received 2 protocol-mandated intravitreal ranibizumab injections. The main outcome measure was injection-free interval to first as-needed ranibizumab injection. Results: DEX increased the injection-free interval versus sham (50th percentile, 34 vs. 29 days; 75th percentile, 85 vs. 56 days; p = 0.016). 8.3% of DEX versus 2.5% of sham-treated patients did not require rescue ranibizumab (p = 0.048). Visual acuity and retinal thickness outcomes were similar in DEX and sham-treated patients. Only reports of conjunctival hemorrhage (18.2 vs. 8.5%) and intraocular pressure elevation (13.2 vs. 4.2%) were significantly different in the DEX versus the sham treatment groups. Conclusion: DEX reduced the need for adjunctive ranibizumab treatment and showed acceptable tolerability in nvAMD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Choroidal neovascularization", "Corticosteroid", "Dexamethasone", "Intravitreal implant", "Ranibizumab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Intravitreal Injections", "Male", "Ranibizumab", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Wet Macular Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942295666", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"7003808387": {"Name": "Kuppermann B.D.", "AuthorID": "7003808387", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California Irvine"}, "56191393400": {"Name": "Li X.Y.", "AuthorID": "56191393400", "AffiliationID": "60000801", "AffiliationName": "Allergan, Inc."}, "57218493643": {"Name": "Liu C.C.", "AuthorID": "57218493643", "AffiliationID": "60000801", "AffiliationName": "Allergan, Inc."}, "38461295400": {"Name": "Lou J.", "AuthorID": "38461295400", "AffiliationID": "60000801", "AffiliationName": "Allergan, Inc."}, "7005895189": {"Name": "Whitcup S.M.", "AuthorID": "7005895189", "AffiliationID": "60000801", "AffiliationName": "Allergan, Inc."}, "6603929506": {"Name": "Maturi R.K.", "AuthorID": "6603929506", "AffiliationID": "60000208, 60021121", "AffiliationName": "Midwest Eye Institute, Indiana University, School of Medicine"}, "54915646600": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "54915646600", "AffiliationID": "109435164", "AffiliationName": "Medical Center Ophthalmology Associates"}, "7403013990": {"Name": "Goldstein M.", "AuthorID": "7403013990", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "7103340901": {"Name": "Pollack A.", "AuthorID": "7103340901", "AffiliationID": "60072445", "AffiliationName": "Hadassah Medical School"}, "7202213472": {"Name": "Weinberger D.", "AuthorID": "7202213472", "AffiliationID": "60022119", "AffiliationName": "Rabin Medical Center"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
