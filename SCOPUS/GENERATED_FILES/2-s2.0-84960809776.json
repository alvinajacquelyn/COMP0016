However, other higher order cognitive functions might be more critical to performance on this task. To date, this idea has not been rigorously investigated in patients with schizophrenia. Methods Neuropsychological measures of processing speed, memory, and executive functioning were completed by 125 patients with schizophrenia and 272 control subjects. We implemented a series of confirmatory factor and structural regression modeling to build an integrated model of processing speed, memory, and executive function with which to deconstruct the digit-symbol substitution task and characterize discrepancies between patients with schizophrenia and control subjects. Results The overall structure of the processing speed, memory, and executive function model was the same across groups (\u03c72 = 208.86, p >.05), but the contribution of the specific cognitive domains to coding task performance differed significantly. When completing the task, control subjects relied on executive function and, indirectly, on working memory ability, whereas patients with schizophrenia used an alternative set of cognitive operations whereby they relied on the same processes required to complete verbal fluency tasks. Conclusions Successful coding task performance relies predominantly on executive function, rather than processing speed or memory. Patients with schizophrenia perform poorly on this task because of an apparent lack of appropriate executive function input; they rely instead on an alternative cognitive pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digit-symbol substitution", "Information processing", "Neuropsychology", "Processing speed", "Schizophrenia", "Structural equation modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Cognition Disorders", "Executive Function", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychomotor Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960809776", "SubjectAreas": [["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55891455300": {"Name": "Knowles E.", "AuthorID": "55891455300", "AffiliationID": "60018395, 60029252", "AffiliationName": "Olin Neuropsychiatric Research Center, Institute of Living, Hartford Hospital"}, "6603114543": {"Name": "Glahn D.", "AuthorID": "6603114543", "AffiliationID": "60018395, 60029252", "AffiliationName": "Olin Neuropsychiatric Research Center, Institute of Living, Hartford Hospital"}, "55035659900": {"Name": "Weiser M.", "AuthorID": "55035659900", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Sheba Medical Centre"}, "7401858081": {"Name": "Davidson M.", "AuthorID": "7401858081", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Sheba Medical Centre"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "55782719300": {"Name": "Reichenberg A.", "AuthorID": "55782719300", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Preventive Medicine, Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sina"}}}
