These are combined with the already measured radial velocities and spectrophotometric distances to obtain full space motions. We use this sample of 1173 stars, located in two pencil-beam sightlines ( = 178\u25e6 and = 118\u25e6), to sample the Galactocentric velocity field out to almost RG = 15 kpc. We find there are significant differences in all three (radial, azimuthal, and vertical) kinematic components between the two directions. The rotation curve is roughly flat in the anticentre direction, confirming and extending the result of Kawata et al. thanks to the greater reach of our spectrophotometric distance scale. However at = 118\u25e6 the circular velocity rises outwards from RG = 10.5 kpc and there is a more pronounced gradient in radial motion than is seen at = 178\u25e6. Furthermore, the A star radial motion differs from the F stars by \u223c10 km s\u22121. We discuss our findings in the context of perturbers potentially responsible for the trends, such as the central bar, spiral arms, the warp, and external satellites. Our results at = 178\u25e6 are broadly consistent with previous work on K giants in the anticentre, but the kinematics at = 118\u25e6 in the Perseus region do not yet reconcile easily with bar or spiral arm perturbation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamics", "Galaxy: disc", "Galaxy: kinematics", "Methods: observational", "Stars: early-type"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067025959", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57214137421": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "57214137421", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7103125772": {"Name": "Drew J.", "AuthorID": "7103125772", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}, "38961675200": {"Name": "Mongui\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "38961675200", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
