This paper combines ideas from their seminal contribution with theories of \u2018job crafting\u2019 and identity to examine the agentic behaviour of employees in low-grade, \u2018dirty work\u2019 as they utilise their expertise and practices to (re)frame their occupational identities and challenge their prescribed job boundaries. The evidence for the paper comes from a qualitative study of hospital porters in the UK\u2019s National Health Service. It argues that this combined theoretical approach provides a potential research and employment framework to challenge the abstracted and stereotypical conceptions of the expertise related to low-grade jobs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agency", "Care", "Expertise", "Hospital porters", "Identity", "Job crafting", "Low-grade work", "Resistance", "\u2018dirty work\u2019"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010815598", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"10140362900": {"Name": "Fuller A.", "AuthorID": "10140362900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "6602780847": {"Name": "Unwin L.", "AuthorID": "6602780847", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
