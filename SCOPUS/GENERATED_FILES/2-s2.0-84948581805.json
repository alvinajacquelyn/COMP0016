However, there will always be considerable uncertainty related to their predictions due to the complexity of the housing stock and the many assumptions required to implement the models. This paper presents a simple Monte Carlo (MC) model that can be easily extended and/or transformed in relation to data available for investigating and quantifying uncertainties in both the housing stock model's predictions and scenario assumptions. While 90% of the MC model predictions fell within a range which is \u00b119% the mean value, 50% of them were within \u00b18% of the mean. The findings suggest that the uncertainties associated with the model predictions and scenario assumptions need to be acknowledged fully and \u2013 where possible \u2013 quantified as even fairly small variability in the influential variables may result in rather large uncertainty in the aggregated model's prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["domestic energy models", "domestic space heating energy use", "explorative scenarios", "Monte Carlo method", "uncertainty analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aggregated modeling", "Domestic energy", "explorative scenarios", "Heating energy", "Housing stock", "Model prediction", "Monte Carlo model", "Optimum energy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948581805", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"23995316100": {"Name": "Kavgic M.", "AuthorID": "23995316100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London"}, "14040664500": {"Name": "Mumovic D.", "AuthorID": "14040664500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London"}, "25643378500": {"Name": "Summerfield A.", "AuthorID": "25643378500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "23052921800": {"Name": "Stevanovic Z.", "AuthorID": "23052921800", "AffiliationID": "60068792, 60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Sciences-Vinca, University of Belgrade"}}}
