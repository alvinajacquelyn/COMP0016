All rights reserved.A number of soundscape studies have suggested the need for suitable parameters for soundscape measurement, in addition to the conventional acoustic parameters. This paper explores the applicability of pitch features that are often used in music analysis and their algorithms to environmental sounds. Based on the existing alternative pitch algorithms for simulating the perception of the auditory system and simplified algorithms for practical applications in the areas of music and speech, the applicable algorithms have been determined, considering common types of sound in everyday soundscapes. Considering a number of pitch parameters, including pitch value, pitch strength, and percentage of audible pitches over time, different pitch characteristics of various environmental sounds have been shown. Among the four sound categories, i.e. water, wind, birdsongs, and urban sounds, generally speaking, both water and wind sounds have low pitch values and pitch strengths; birdsongs have high pitch values and pitch strengths; and urban sounds have low pitch values and a relatively wide range of pitch strengths.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environmental sound", "Pitch estimation", "Psychoacoustics", "Soundscape"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic parameters", "Auditory systems", "Environmental sounds", "Music analysis", "Pitch estimation", "Psychoacoustics", "Simplified algorithms", "Soundscapes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979488000", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55703276000": {"Name": "Yang M.", "AuthorID": "55703276000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}}}
