For the Fe series, all attempts to dehydrate the samples doped with selenate resulted in amorphous products, and it is suspected that a side redox reaction involving the Fe and selenate may be occurring leading to phase decomposition and hence the lack of a crystalline product on dehydration. For M = Mn, Co, Ni, the structure observed was shown to depend upon the transition metal cation and level of selenate doping. An alluaudite phase, Na3M1.5(SO4)3-1.5x(SeO4)1.5x, was observed for the selenate doped compositions, with this phase forming as a single phase for x \u2265 0.5 M = Co, and x = 1.0 M = Ni. For M = Mn, the alluaudite structure is obtained across the series, albeit with small impurities for lower selenate content samples. Although the alluaudite-type phases Na2+2y(Mn/Co)2\u2212y(SO4)3 have recently been reported [1,2], doping with selenate appears to increase the maximum sodium content within the structure. Moreover, the selenate doped Ni based samples reported here are the first examples of a Ni sulfate/selenate containing system exhibiting the alluaudite structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alluaudite", "Crystal structure", "Selenate", "Sodium ion", "Sulfate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alluaudite", "Phase decompositions", "Phase forming", "Selenate", "Single phase", "Sodium ions", "Sulfate", "Transition metal cations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031123403", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57189351678": {"Name": "Driscoll L.", "AuthorID": "57189351678", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "9844777200": {"Name": "Kendrick E.", "AuthorID": "9844777200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "WMG, University of Warwick"}, "57198696839": {"Name": "Wright A.", "AuthorID": "57198696839", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "55138337300": {"Name": "Slater P.", "AuthorID": "55138337300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, The Natural History Museum"}}}
