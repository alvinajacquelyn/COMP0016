Whether this malleability is observed in the auditory domain and in genuine emotion expressions is poorly explored. We examined the perception of authentic laughter and crying in the context of happy, neutral and sad facial expressions. Participants rated the vocalisations on separate unipolar scales of happiness and sadness and on arousal. Although they were instructed to focus exclusively on the vocalisations, consistent context effects were found: For both laughter and crying, emotion judgements were shifted towards the information expressed by the face. These modulations were independent of response latencies and were larger for more emotionally ambiguous vocalisations. No effects of context were found for arousal ratings. These findings suggest that the automatic encoding of contextual information during emotion perception generalises across modalities, to purely non-verbal vocalisations, and is not confined to acted expressions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Context", "Cross-modal biases", "Emotion perception", "Non-verbal vocalisations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Arousal", "Auditory Perception", "Crying", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Laughter", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reaction Time", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929710596", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"56366640300": {"Name": "Lavan N.", "AuthorID": "56366640300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "55486476700": {"Name": "Harvey H.", "AuthorID": "55486476700", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "8358934300": {"Name": "McGettigan C.", "AuthorID": "8358934300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "35932464400": {"Name": "Lima C.F.", "AuthorID": "35932464400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7401505962": {"Name": "Scott S.K.", "AuthorID": "7401505962", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
