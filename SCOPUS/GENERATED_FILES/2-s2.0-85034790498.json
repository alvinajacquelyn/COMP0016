Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjectives: Patients with severe subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) often suffer from complications with delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) due to vasospasm that is difficult to identify by clinical examination. The purpose of this study was to monitor seizures and to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neurofilament light (NFL) and tau, and to see whether they could be used for predicting preclinical DCI. Methods: We prospectively studied 19 patients with aneurysmal SAH who underwent treatment with endovascular coiling. The patients were monitored with continuous EEG (cEEG) and received external ventricular drainage (EVD). CSF samples of neurofilament light (NLF) and total tau (T-tau) protein were collected at day 4 and day 10. Cox regression analysis was applied to evaluate whether seizures and protein biomarkers were associated with DCI and poor outcome. Results: Seven patients developed DCI (37%), and 4 patients (21%) died within the first 2 months. Six patients (32%) had clinical seizures, and electrographic seizures were noted in one additional patient (4.5%). Increased tau ratio (proportion tau10/tau4) was significantly associated with DCI and hazard ratio [HR=1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.055-1.680. P =.016]. Conclusion: Acute symptomatic seizures are common in SAH, but their presence is not predictive of DCI. High values of the tau ratio in the CSF may be associated with development of DCI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute symptomatic seizures", "cerebrospinal biomarkers", "continuous EEG monitoring", "NFL and tau", "non-convulsive seizures", "subarachnoid haemorrhage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Brain Ischemia", "Female", "Humans", "Intermediate Filaments", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Seizures", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "tau Proteins", "Vasospasm, Intracranial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034790498", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57191129498": {"Name": "Halawa I.", "AuthorID": "57191129498", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University"}, "57196152742": {"Name": "Vlachogiannis P.", "AuthorID": "57196152742", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University"}, "55904839900": {"Name": "Amandusson", "AuthorID": "55904839900", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University"}, "8334428400": {"Name": "Elf K.", "AuthorID": "8334428400", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University"}, "8611406100": {"Name": "Engstr\u00f6m E.R.", "AuthorID": "8611406100", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University"}, "6602537011": {"Name": "Kumlien E.", "AuthorID": "6602537011", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
