Defect formation and ionization energies show that divalent dopants are counterbalanced in GaN by nitrogen vacancies and not by holes, which explains both the difficulty in achieving p-type conductivity in GaN and the associated major spectroscopic features, including the ubiquitous 3.46 eV photoluminescence line, a characteristic of all lightly divalent-metal-doped GaN materials that has also been shown to occur in pure GaN samples. Our results give a comprehensive explanation for the observed behavior of GaN doped with low concentrations of divalent metals in good agreement with relevant experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Defect formation", "Hole localization", "Low concentrations", "Nitrogen vacancies", "P type conductivity", "Photoluminescence lines", "Reference levels", "Spectroscopic features"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921044793", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56736199700": {"Name": "Buckeridge J.", "AuthorID": "56736199700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "36247385200": {"Name": "Miskufova M.", "AuthorID": "36247385200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "7003322273": {"Name": "Woodley S.", "AuthorID": "7003322273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "7005172169": {"Name": "Sokol A.", "AuthorID": "7005172169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "6508375764": {"Name": "Keal T.", "AuthorID": "6508375764", "AffiliationID": "60004762, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, STFC, Daresbury Laboratory"}, "35084256200": {"Name": "Sherwood P.", "AuthorID": "35084256200", "AffiliationID": "60004762, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, STFC, Daresbury Laboratory"}, "35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}}}
