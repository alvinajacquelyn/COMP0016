However, causal relationships between these frontal regions and basal ganglia are not fully understood in humans. Here, we partly examined these causal links by measuring human fMRI activity during SST before and after excitatory/inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of pre-SMA. We first confirmed that the behavioral performance of SST was improved by excitatory rTMS and impaired by inhibitory rTMS. Afterward, we found that these behavioral changes were well predicted by rTMSinduced modulation of brain activity in pre-SMA, STR, and GPi during SST. Moreover, by examining the effects of the rTMS on restingstate functional connectivity between these three regions, we showed that the magnetic stimulation of pre-SMA significantly affected intrinsic connectivity between pre-SMA and STR, and between STR and GPi. Furthermore, the magnitudes of changes in resting-state connectivity were also correlated with the behavioral changes seen in SST. These results suggest a causal relationship between pre-SMA and GPi via STR during response inhibition, and add direct evidence that the fronto basal ganglia network for response inhibition consists of multiple top-down regulation pathways in humans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Partial correlation", "QPS", "Response cancellation", "Response inhibition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Basal Ganglia", "Brain Mapping", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Inhibition (Psychology)", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Neural Pathways", "Psychomotor Performance", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925860948", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"24073830200": {"Name": "Watanabe T.", "AuthorID": "24073830200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "35484238300": {"Name": "Hirose S.", "AuthorID": "35484238300", "AffiliationID": "60009740", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine"}, "7201378067": {"Name": "Miyashita Y.", "AuthorID": "7201378067", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Physiology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "7202506604": {"Name": "Konishi S.", "AuthorID": "7202506604", "AffiliationID": "60009740", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine"}, "7004551024": {"Name": "Hanajima R.", "AuthorID": "7004551024", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "16403189200": {"Name": "Shirota Y.", "AuthorID": "16403189200", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "54885709700": {"Name": "Tsutsumi R.", "AuthorID": "54885709700", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "43761650800": {"Name": "Shimizu T.", "AuthorID": "43761650800", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "56086389400": {"Name": "Hayashi T.", "AuthorID": "56086389400", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "7101965842": {"Name": "Terao Y.", "AuthorID": "7101965842", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "37761622300": {"Name": "Katsura M.", "AuthorID": "37761622300", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "55908917900": {"Name": "Kunimatsu A.", "AuthorID": "55908917900", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "35370992200": {"Name": "Ohtomo K.", "AuthorID": "35370992200", "AffiliationID": "60002354", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, The University of Tokyo School of Medicine"}, "7005460744": {"Name": "Ugawa Y.", "AuthorID": "7005460744", "AffiliationID": "60015682", "AffiliationName": "Research Seeds Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency"}}}
