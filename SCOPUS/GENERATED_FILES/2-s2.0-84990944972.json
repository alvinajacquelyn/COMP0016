This current study aims to assess corneal vascularization secondary to herpetic keratitis pre- and post-treatment using serial OCTA imaging adapted for the anterior segment. Methods: All eyes were scanned using the split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm on the AngioVue OCTA system (Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA, USA) with an anterior segment lens adapter. Multiple scans in the regions of interest (ROI) before and after treatment were analysed to assess change in corneal vascularization in response to each treatment modality. Results: We analyzed a total of 12 OCTA scans in three eyes with corneal vascularization, comparing images pre- and 3 months post-treatment. We found that the OCTA was able to detect a significant decrease in area of vascularization in all eyes: including fine-needle diathermy (48 \u00b1 7 to 41 \u00b1 5 %, P = 0.048), subconjunctival bevacizumab (45 \u00b1 7 to 38 \u00b1 5 %, P = 0.015) and systemic steroid treatment following graft rejection (38 \u00b1 1 to 32 \u00b1 2 %, P = 0.003). Conclusions: Our preliminary study of serial OCTA scans suggests that this may be a useful tool for objective quantification of corneal vascularization. Future development of image processing software will be needed for clinical use or trials to evaluate anti-vascular therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior segment angiography", "Corneal vascularization", "Optical coherence tomography angiography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Angiography", "Cornea", "Corneal Neovascularization", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990944972", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56799513200": {"Name": "Cai Y.", "AuthorID": "56799513200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15830832100": {"Name": "Wilkins M.R.", "AuthorID": "15830832100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23767097100": {"Name": "Ang M.", "AuthorID": "23767097100", "AffiliationID": "60024285, 60008970", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Center"}, "30267484000": {"Name": "Alio del Barrio J.L.", "AuthorID": "30267484000", "AffiliationID": "60023789", "AffiliationName": "Cornea, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Unit, Vissum Corporaci\u00f3n"}}}
