All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate whether HIV-infected individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis (HIV-TB) around the time of starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) have impaired CD4 + cell responses to treatment. Design: Analysis of a national cohort of HIV-infected adults, linked to the national TB surveillance system for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, including individuals starting ART from 2005 to 2009. Methods: We compared CD4 + cell responses in HIV-infected individuals starting ART with a TB diagnosis ('HIV-TB cohort') with those not known to have TB ('TB-free cohort'). The TB-free cohort was frequency-matched to the HIV-TB cases for sex, age strata, baseline CD4 + strata and ethnicity. Median change in CD4 + cell count from baseline (\u0394CD4 +) was calculated at 6-monthly intervals until 36 months. Results: There were 593 and 1779 individuals in the HIV-TB and TB-free cohorts, respectively (median follow-up 3.8 years). In both cohorts, median age was 36 years, 49.2% were women and 74.9% were black-African. Median baseline CD4 + at the start of treatment was similar in the HIV-TB and TB-free cohorts (74 vs. 80 cells/\u03bcl). Median \u0394CD4 + was similar in HIV-TB and TB-free cohorts at all time points [294 (inter-quartile range 198-424) cells/\u03bcl in HIV-TB cohort; 296 (inter-quartile range 196-431) cells/\u03bcl in TB-free cohort after 3 years of ART]. A higher proportion of the HIV-TB cohort than the TB-free cohort died during follow-up (4.2 vs. 2.2%; P = 0.01); 78.5% of all individuals who died had a baseline CD4 + cell count below 100 cells/\u03bcl. Conclusions: Long-term CD4 + cell recovery during ART appears similar in HIV-TB and TB-free patients. Significant mortality in both cohorts highlights the need for earlier HIV diagnosis and ART initiation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "antiretroviral therapy", "CD4 +", "HIV", "immune recovery", "opportunistic infection", "tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cohort Studies", "Coinfection", "England", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Northern Ireland", "Tuberculosis", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941550329", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56645308000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56645308000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "36190408300": {"Name": "Brown A.E.", "AuthorID": "36190408300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "6505927242": {"Name": "Zenner D.", "AuthorID": "6505927242", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "8709498500": {"Name": "Rice B.", "AuthorID": "8709498500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "26321266300": {"Name": "Yin Z.", "AuthorID": "26321266300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "7403743062": {"Name": "Thomas H.L.", "AuthorID": "7403743062", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "10440140300": {"Name": "Delpech V.", "AuthorID": "10440140300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7006184267": {"Name": "Pozniak A.", "AuthorID": "7006184267", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
