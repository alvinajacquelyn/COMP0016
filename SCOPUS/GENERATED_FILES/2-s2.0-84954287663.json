All rights reserved.Objective: Barrett's oesophagus commonly presents as a patchwork of columnar metaplasia with and without goblet cells in the distal oesophagus. The presence of metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells on oesophageal biopsy is a marker of cancer progression risk, but it is unclear whether clonal expansion and progression in Barrett's oesophagus is exclusive to columnar epithelium with goblet cells. Design: We developed a novel method to trace the clonal ancestry of an oesophageal adenocarcinoma across an entire Barrett's segment. Clonal expansions in Barrett's mucosa were identified using cytochrome c oxidase enzyme histochemistry. Somatic mutations were identified through mitochondrial DNA sequencing and single gland whole exome sequencing. Results: By tracing the clonal origin of an oesophageal adenocarcinoma across an entire Barrett's segment through a combination of histopathological spatial mapping and clonal ordering, we find that this cancer developed from a premalignant clonal expansion in non-dysplastic ('cardia-type') columnar metaplasia without goblet cells. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate the premalignant potential of metaplastic columnar epithelium without goblet cells in the context of Barrett's oesophagus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Barrett Esophagus", "Biopsy", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Epithelium", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Exome", "Female", "Goblet Cells", "Humans", "Metaplasia", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Mutation", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954287663", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57217584796": {"Name": "Lavery D.L.", "AuthorID": "57217584796", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56437787200": {"Name": "Martinez P.", "AuthorID": "56437787200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35800773700": {"Name": "Gay L.J.", "AuthorID": "35800773700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "14015102600": {"Name": "Cereser B.", "AuthorID": "14015102600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "26021895300": {"Name": "Graham T.A.", "AuthorID": "26021895300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8333053900": {"Name": "McDonald S.A.C.", "AuthorID": "8333053900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7201531909": {"Name": "Wright N.A.", "AuthorID": "7201531909", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57220668111": {"Name": "Jansen M.", "AuthorID": "57220668111", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Centre"}, "7004333584": {"Name": "Novelli M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004333584", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London"}, "22036034000": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Justo M.", "AuthorID": "22036034000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London"}, "55420460800": {"Name": "Meijer S.L.", "AuthorID": "55420460800", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Centre"}}}
