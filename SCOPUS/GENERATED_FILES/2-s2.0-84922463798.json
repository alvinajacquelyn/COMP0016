The microbubble diameter is shown to be a function of rotational speed and working pressure of the processing system, and a modified Rayleigh-Plesset equation has been derived to explain the bubble-forming mechanism. A parametric plot is constructed to identify a rotating speed and working pressure regime, which allows for continuous bubbling. Bare protein (lysozyme) microbubbles generated in this way exhibit a morphological change, resulting in microcapsules over a period of time. Microbubbles prepared with gold nanoparticles at the bubble surface showed greater stability over a time period and retained the same morphology. The functionalization of microbubbles with gold nanoparticles also rendered optical tunability and has promising applications in imaging, biosensing, and diagnostics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Forming mechanism", "Functionalizations", "Gold Nanoparticles", "Modified Rayleigh", "Morphological changes", "Optical tunability", "Processing systems", "Working pressures", "Gold", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Microbubbles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922463798", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"22935212900": {"Name": "Mahalingam S.", "AuthorID": "22935212900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55948967400": {"Name": "Raimi-Abraham B.T.", "AuthorID": "55948967400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55428995000": {"Name": "Craig D.Q.M.", "AuthorID": "55428995000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
