TaMHS aimed to improve mental health for students with, or at risk of, behavioral and emotional difficulties by providing evidence-informed interventions relating to closer working relationships between health and education services. Our study involved 8,480 children (aged 8-9 years) from 266 elementary schools. Students in intervention schools with, or at risk of, behavioral difficulties reported significant reductions in behavioral difficulties compared with control school students, but no such difference was found for students with, or at risk of, emotional difficulties. Implementation of TaMHS was associated with increased school provision of a range of interventions and enhanced collaboration between schools and local specialist mental health providers. The implications of these findings are discussed, in addition to the strengths and limitations of the study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002529582", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "8923645900": {"Name": "Fugard A.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8923645900", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "7005855451": {"Name": "Humphrey N.", "AuthorID": "7005855451", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "55746318400": {"Name": "Patalay P.", "AuthorID": "55746318400", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "7006451757": {"Name": "Belsky J.", "AuthorID": "7006451757", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "7006028962": {"Name": "Vostanis P.", "AuthorID": "7006028962", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}}}
