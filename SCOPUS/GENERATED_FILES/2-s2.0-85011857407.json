The clinical phenotype varies from a severe infantile form to a milder muscle form. Here, we report a 9-year-old boy referred to our hospital for the investigation of hematuria with a 2-day history of dark urine and malaise. As no erythrocytes in the microscopic examination of the urine and hemoglobinuria were present, myoglobinuria due to rhabdomyolysis was the most probable cause of dark urine. After excluding the other causes of rhabdomyolysis, with the help of metabolic investigations, the patient was suspected to have CPT-II deficiency, the most common cause of metabolic rhabdomyolysis. Our aim in presenting this case is to emphasize considering rhabdomyolysis in the differential diagnosis of dark urine in order to prevent recurrent rhabdomyolysis and renal injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency", "Dark urine", "Hematuria", "Myalgia", "Red urine", "Rhabdomyolysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase", "Child", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Prognosis", "Rhabdomyolysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011857407", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"24468267500": {"Name": "Melek E.", "AuthorID": "24468267500", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Cukurova University"}, "57193226173": {"Name": "Atml\u015f B.", "AuthorID": "57193226173", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Cukurova University"}, "57193230032": {"Name": "Bayazlt A.", "AuthorID": "57193230032", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Cukurova University"}, "57193232217": {"Name": "Bulut F.", "AuthorID": "57193232217", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Metabolism, Cukurova University"}, "57193231565": {"Name": "Yllmaz B.", "AuthorID": "57193231565", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Metabolism, Cukurova University"}, "7005565613": {"Name": "Mungan N.", "AuthorID": "7005565613", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Metabolism, Cukurova University"}}}
