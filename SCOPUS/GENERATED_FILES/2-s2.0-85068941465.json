Such effects are robust and consequential. A number of different accounts have been proposed to explain these effects. What is currently unclear is under which situations different mechanisms play more or less critical roles. An extant test from the literature is proposed as a \"signature test\" for the operation of selective accessibility mechanisms. Four experiments were conducted to ascertain the evidence for selective accessibility with this test, evidence which was not obtained. A fifth experiment employed a different methodology, and again failed to show evidence for selective accessibility. Subsequent discussion suggests that the robustness of anchoring effects is remarkable, but the theoretical basis for some previous tests of the selective accessibility account of anchoring is shaky, and we advise against their use in this capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anchoring", "Judgment and decision making", "Lexical-decision task", "Replication", "Selective accessibility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068941465", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"57210541409": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "57210541409", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209854484": {"Name": "Blower F.", "AuthorID": "57209854484", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209853525": {"Name": "Rodgers S.", "AuthorID": "57209853525", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209852874": {"Name": "Lagator S.", "AuthorID": "57209852874", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209859199": {"Name": "Page E.", "AuthorID": "57209859199", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209860129": {"Name": "Burton A.", "AuthorID": "57209860129", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209850729": {"Name": "Urlichich D.", "AuthorID": "57209850729", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23470488800": {"Name": "Speekenbrink M.", "AuthorID": "23470488800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
