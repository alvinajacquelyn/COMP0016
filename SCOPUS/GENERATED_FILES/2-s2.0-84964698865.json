All rights reserved.Motors proteins of the conserved kinesin-14 family have important roles in mitotic spindle organization and chromosome segregation. Previous studies have indicated that kinesin-14 motors are non-processive enzymes, working in the context of multi-motor ensembles that collectively organize microtubule networks. Here we show that the yeast kinesin-14 Kar3 generates processive movement as a heterodimer with the non-motor proteins Cik1 or Vik1. By analyzing the single-molecule properties of engineered motors we demonstrate that the non-catalytic domain has a key role in the motility mechanism by acting as a \"foothold\" that allows Kar3 to bias translocation towards the minus end. This mechanism rivals the speed and run length of conventional motors, can support transport of the Ndc80 complex in vitro and is critical for Kar3 function in vivo. Our findings provide an example for a non-conventional translocation mechanism and help to explain how Kar3 can substitute for key functions of Dynein in the yeast nucleus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromosome segregation", "Hand-over-hand", "Kinesin regulation", "Kinesin-14", "Kinetochore transport", "Single molecule biophysics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalytic Domain", "Catalytic Domain", "Dimerization", "Dimerization", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Subcellular Fractions", "Subcellular Fractions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964698865", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24528767100": {"Name": "Mieck C.", "AuthorID": "24528767100", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}, "8324241600": {"Name": "Molodtsov M.I.", "AuthorID": "8324241600", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Research Platform Quantum Phenomena and Nanoscale Biological Systems (QuNaBioS), University of Vienna"}, "56500628300": {"Name": "Drzewicka K.", "AuthorID": "56500628300", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}, "23478415200": {"Name": "Van Der Vaart B.", "AuthorID": "23478415200", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}, "55175180400": {"Name": "Litos G.", "AuthorID": "55175180400", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}, "54790216000": {"Name": "Schmauss G.", "AuthorID": "54790216000", "AffiliationID": "124846834", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biotechnology Austria, IMBA"}, "7003970024": {"Name": "Vaziri A.", "AuthorID": "7003970024", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Research Platform Quantum Phenomena and Nanoscale Biological Systems (QuNaBioS), University of Vienna"}, "6603893656": {"Name": "Westermann S.", "AuthorID": "6603893656", "AffiliationID": "60031851", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Molecular Pathology"}}}
