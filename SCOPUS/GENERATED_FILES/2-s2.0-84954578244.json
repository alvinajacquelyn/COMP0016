All rights are reserved.Archaeal RNA polymerase and general transcription factors are more closely related to those of eukaryotes than of bacteria. As such the study of transcription of archaea is important both in terms of examination of the evolution of the transcriptional machinery and as a simplified tool for eukaryotic transcription. In particular, the hyperthermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii provides us with a fully recombinant RNA polymerase system allowing for much more detailed in vitro examination of the roles of different components during the transcription cycle than otherwise possible. The individual subunits of M. jannaschii enzyme are easily expressed and purified from heterologous expression systems. Forming functional RNA polymerase involves simply combining the different subunits under denaturing conditions and slowly removing the denaturant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaea", "Methanocaldococcus jannaschii", "Recombinant RNAP", "RNA polymerase", "Transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases", "Methanocaldococcus", "Molecular Biology", "Silver Staining", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954578244", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8507314600": {"Name": "Smollett K.", "AuthorID": "8507314600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "23007827100": {"Name": "Blombach F.", "AuthorID": "23007827100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7102647041": {"Name": "Werner F.", "AuthorID": "7102647041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
