Here we use Bragg coherent diffraction imaging to investigate a contrasting system, the epitaxial growth of calcite (CaCO 3) crystals on organic self-assembled monolayers, where these are widely used as a model for biomineralization processes. The calcite crystals are imaged to simultaneously visualize the crystal morphology and internal strain fields. Our data reveal that each crystal possesses a single dislocation loop that occupies a common position in every crystal. The loops exhibit entirely different geometries to misfit dislocations generated in conventional epitaxial thin films and are suggested to form in response to the stress field, arising from interfacial defects and the nanoscale roughness of the substrate. This work provides unique insight into how self-assembled monolayers control the growth of inorganic crystals and demonstrates important differences as compared with inorganic substrates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975056647", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55625772100": {"Name": "Ihli J.", "AuthorID": "55625772100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "7410210439": {"Name": "Kim Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "7410210439", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "55261828300": {"Name": "Schenk A.S.", "AuthorID": "55261828300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "7006553128": {"Name": "Kulak A.N.", "AuthorID": "7006553128", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "7004934495": {"Name": "Meldrum F.C.", "AuthorID": "7004934495", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "24597708500": {"Name": "Clark J.N.", "AuthorID": "24597708500", "AffiliationID": "60030635", "AffiliationName": "Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (DESY)"}, "24177834400": {"Name": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 A.S.", "AuthorID": "24177834400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101657971": {"Name": "Duffy D.M.", "AuthorID": "7101657971", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "9846220600": {"Name": "Comyn T.P.", "AuthorID": "9846220600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Research, University of Leeds"}, "55634001500": {"Name": "Chammas O.", "AuthorID": "55634001500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Rfaut School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds"}, "35329361400": {"Name": "Harder R.J.", "AuthorID": "35329361400", "AffiliationID": "60005498", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Photon Source"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
