These systems include a number of hybrid inorganic-organic analogues of conventional ceramics, such as Ruddlesden-Popper phases and perovskites. The structure types adopted are rationalized in the broader context of all known dicyanometallate framework structures. We show that the structural diversity of this family can be understood in terms of (i) the charge and coordination preferences of the particular metal cation acting as framework node, and (ii) the size, shape, and extent of incorporation of extra-framework cations. In this way, we suggest that dicyanometallates form a particularly attractive model family of extended frameworks in which to explore the interplay between molecular degrees of freedom, framework topology, and supramolecular interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Extra-framework cations", "Framework structures", "Hybrid inorganic-organic", "Metal cation", "Ruddlesden-Popper phasis", "Structural diversity", "Structure type", "Supramolecular interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971324513", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56440608300": {"Name": "Hill J.", "AuthorID": "56440608300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7404597548": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "7404597548", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "10043396400": {"Name": "Goodwin A.", "AuthorID": "10043396400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
