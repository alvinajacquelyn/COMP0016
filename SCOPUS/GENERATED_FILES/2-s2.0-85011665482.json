Detection methods can be employed to sense the existence of an attack. In a previous study of an attack on the controller while avoiding detection in scalar systems under a certain control assumption, the notion of \u03f5-stealthiness was introduced and the strength of \u03f5-stealthy attacks was fully characterized. We generalize to the vector system and prove the cases in which we show that the limitations of \u03f5-stealthy attack do not extend, in the sense that \u03f5-stealthy can inflict damage of arbitrary magnitude to a vector system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyber-physical systems", "detection", "security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catastrophic effects", "Detection methods", "Higher-order systems", "Scalar systems", "security", "Security problems", "Vector systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011665482", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57193209079": {"Name": "Kung E.", "AuthorID": "57193209079", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "35230888900": {"Name": "Shi L.", "AuthorID": "35230888900", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "7402866285": {"Name": "Dey S.", "AuthorID": "7402866285", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Sciences, Uppsala University"}}}
