For people with severe disabilities, there is a body of research investigating how best to share control of motion between a person with disabilities and a \"smart wheelchair\". Traditionally in \"shared control\", the control law is a linear combination of the human's intended velocity and the path planner's velocity. However, this formulation of sharing control between a human and a machine does not guarantee safety on a theoretical level. To guarantee safety in formulating the blending of the human's input velocity and planner's velocity, we implement a practical form of probabilistic shared control formulated by Trautman. We tested this shared control by conducting experiments in a simulation where participants drive a wheelchair. The results of the experiment suggest probabilistic shared control has similar performance to linear blending in terms of significant reduction in number of collisions. However, for the sip-puff switch (a particularly difficult interface to use), probabilistic shared control yielded a greater reduction in collisions than linear blending.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Independent mobilities", "Input velocity", "Linear combinations", "Path planners", "Severe disabilities", "Shared control", "Smart wheelchairs", "Wheelchair simulators"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044238053", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57197793659": {"Name": "Ezeh C.", "AuthorID": "57197793659", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067, 60099424", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Create, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56295883500": {"Name": "Carlson T.", "AuthorID": "56295883500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067, 60099424", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Create, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36803082100": {"Name": "Trautman P.", "AuthorID": "36803082100", "AffiliationID": "101449039", "AffiliationName": "Galois Inc"}, "7101643482": {"Name": "Holloway C.", "AuthorID": "7101643482", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), University College London"}}}
