Through careful analysis of previously published data (x=0.053,0.061,0.076), we find an extended region below the Debye temperature in which the resistivity appears to scale linearly with temperature. Meanwhile, resonant (in)elastic x-ray scattering data (x=0.065) suggest a possible crossover from quantum paramagnetic to quantum critical phenomenology between 100 and 200 K. We put this into context with other results, and propose a possible phase diagram as a function of doping.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053918129", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56735783700": {"Name": "Vale J.G.", "AuthorID": "56735783700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56459634200": {"Name": "Hunter E.C.", "AuthorID": "56459634200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory"}}}
